 Recalling also the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, including 

resolution 2334 (2016) of 23 December 2016, 

 Taking into account the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the

wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,
7
 and recalling in this regard its resolution

 Recalling the statement of 15 July 1999 and the declarations adopted on 

5 December 2001 and on 17 December 2014
8
 by the Conference of High Contracting 

Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention, and welcoming initiatives by States 

parties, both individually and collectively, according to article 1 of the Convention 

and aimed at ensuring respect for the Convention in the Occupied Palestinian 

Territory, including East Jerusalem,  

 Recalling also its resolution 58/292 of 6 May 2004, 

 Taking note of the report of the independent international fact-finding mission 

to investigate the implications of the Israeli settlements on the civil, political, 

economic, social and cultural rights of the Palestinian people throughout the 

Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem,
9
 

 Taking note also of Human Rights Council resolution 31/36 of 24 March 

2016,
10

  

 Convinced that occupation itself represents a gross and grave violation of 

human rights, 

 Noting with deep regret that 50 years have passed since the onset of the Israeli 

occupation, and stressing the urgent need for efforts to reverse the negative trends 

on the ground and to restore a political horizon for advancing and accelerating 

meaningful negotiations aimed at the achievement of a peace agreement that will 

bring a complete end to the Israeli occupation that began in 1967 and the resolution 

of all core final status issues, without exception, leading to a peaceful, just, lasting 

and comprehensive solution for the question of Palestine,  

 Recognizing that the occupation and ensuing persistent and systematic 

violations of international law by Israel, including international humanitarian and 

human rights law, are considered to be the main sources of other Israeli violations 

and discriminatory policies against the Palestinian civilian population in the 

Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem,  

 Gravely concerned about the continuing detrimental impact of ongoing 

unlawful Israeli practices and measures in the Occupied Palestinian Terr itory, 

including East Jerusalem, including the excessive use of force by the Israeli 

occupying forces against Palestinian civilians, resulting in the death and injury of 

civilians and the widespread destruction of property and vital infrastructure, 

including during the Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip in July and August 

2014, as well as ongoing settlement activities and construction of the wall, the 

internal forced displacement of civilians, the imposition of collective punishment 

measures, particularly against the civilian population in the Gaza Strip, where 

continuing severe restrictions on movement amount to a blockade, and the detention 

and imprisonment of thousands of Palestinians,

violations, protect civilians and promote peace, 

 Having considered the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli

agreements between the Palestinian and Israeli sides,  

 Stressing the urgency of bringing a complete end to the Israeli occupation that

including their right to self-determination and their independent State,  

 Taking note of the application of Palestine for admission to membership in the 

United Nations, submitted on 23 September 2011,

 Recalling its resolution 67/19 of 29 November 2012, by which, inter alia, 

Palestine was accorded non-member observer State status in the United Nations, and 

taking note of the follow-up report of the Secretary-General,
18

 

 Noting the accession by Palestine to several human rights treaties and the core 

humanitarian law conventions, as well as other international treaties,  

 1. Commends the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices 

Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the 

Occupied Territories for its impartiality and efforts in performing the tasks assigned 

to it by the General Assembly in spite of the obstruction of its mandate;
