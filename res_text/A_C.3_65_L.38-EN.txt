 Recalling further the Declaration on the Right to Development adopted by the 
General Assembly in its resolution 41/128 of 4 December 1986, 

 Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration4 and the outcome 
documents of the twenty third5 and twenty fourth6 special sessions of the General 
Assembly, held in New York from 5 to 10 June 2000 and in Geneva from 26 June to 
1 July 2000, respectively, 

 Recalling also its resolutions 64/160 and 64/174 of 18 December 2009, 

 Recalling further Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/17 of 14 April 
2005 on globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights,7 

 Recognizing that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a 
fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, 

 Realizing that globalization affects all countries differently and makes them 
more exposed to external developments, positive as well as negative, inter alia, in 
the field of human rights, 

 Realizing also that globalization is not merely an economic process, but that it 
also has social, political, environmental, cultural and legal dimensions, which have 
an impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights, 

 Emphasizing the need to fully implement the global partnership for 
development and enhance the momentum generated by the 2005 World Summit in 
order to operationalize and implement the commitments made in the outcomes of 
the major United Nations conferences and summits, including the 2005 World 
Summit, in the economic, social and related fields, and reaffirming in particular the 
commitment contained in paragraphs 19 and 47 of the 2005 World Summit 
Outcome8 to promote fair globalization and the development of the productive 
sectors in developing countries to enable them to participate more effectively in and 
benefit from the process of globalization, 

 Realizing the need to undertake a thorough, independent and comprehensive 
assessment of the social, environmental and cultural impact of globalization on 
societies, 

 Recognizing in each culture a dignity and value that deserve recognition, 
respect and preservation, convinced that, in their rich variety and diversity and in 
the reciprocal influences that they exert on one another, all cultures form part of the 
common heritage belonging to all humankind, and aware of the risk that 
globalization poses more of a threat to cultural diversity if the developing world 
remains poor and marginalized, 

 Recognizing also that multilateral mechanisms have a unique role to play in 
meeting the challenges and opportunities presented by globalization,

 Realizing the need to consider the opportunities and challenges linked to 
globalization with a view to addressing such challenges and building on possible 
opportunities in order to achieve the full enjoyment of all human rights, 

 Emphasizing the global character of the migratory phenomenon, the 
importance of international, regional and bilateral cooperation and the need to 
protect the human rights of migrants, particularly at a time in which migration flows 
have increased in the globalized economy, 

 Expressing concern at the negative impact of international financial turbulence 
on social and economic development and on the full enjoyment of all human rights, 
particularly in the light of the current global financial and economic crisis, which 
has an adverse impact on the realization of the internationally agreed development 
goals, particularly the Millennium Development Goals, and recognizing that 
developing countries are in a more vulnerable situation when facing such an impact, 

 Expressing deep concern at the negative impact of the rising global food and 
energy challenges and climate change on social and economic development and on 
the full enjoyment of all human rights for all, 

 Recognizing that globalization should be guided by the fundamental principles 
that underpin the corpus of human rights, such as equity, participation, 
accountability, non-discrimination at both the national and the international levels, 
respect for diversity, tolerance and international cooperation and solidarity, 

 Emphasizing that the existence of widespread extreme poverty inhibits the full 
realization and effective enjoyment of human rights, and that its immediate alleviation 
and eventual elimination must remain a high priority for the international community, 

 Acknowledging that there is greater acceptance that the increasing debt burden 
faced by the most indebted developing countries is unsustainable and constitutes 
one of the principal obstacles to achieving sustainable development and poverty 
eradication and that, for many developing countries, excessive debt servicing has 
severely constrained their capacity to promote social development and to provide 
basic services to realize economic, social and cultural rights, 

 Strongly reiterating the determination to ensure the timely and full realization 
of the development goals and objectives agreed at the major United Nations 
conferences and summits, including those agreed at the Millennium Summit, that 
are described as the Millennium Development Goals, which have helped to 
galvanize efforts towards poverty eradication, 

 Deeply concerned at the inadequacy of measures to narrow the widening gap 
between the developed and the developing countries, and within countries, which 
has contributed to, inter alia, deepening poverty and has adversely affected the full 
enjoyment of all human rights, in particular in developing countries, 

 Emphasizing that transnational corporations and other business enterprises 
have a responsibility to respect all human rights, 

 Underlining that human beings strive for a world that is respectful of human 
rights and cultural diversity and that, in this regard, they work to ensure that all 
activities, including those affected by globalization, are consistent with those aims,

 1. Recognizes that, while globalization, by its impact on, inter alia, the role 
of the State, may affect human rights, the promotion and protection of all human 
rights is first and foremost the responsibility of the State; 

 2. Emphasizes that development should be at the centre of the international 
economic agenda and that coherence between national development strategies and 
international obligations and commitments is imperative for an enabling 
environment for development and an inclusive and equitable globalization; 

 3. Reaffirms that narrowing the gap between rich and poor, both within and 
between countries, is an explicit goal at the national and international levels, as part 
of the effort to create an enabling environment for the full enjoyment of all human 
rights; 

 4. Also reaffirms the commitment to create an environment at both the 
national and the global levels that is conducive to development and to the 
eradication of poverty by, inter alia, promoting good governance within each 
country and at the international level, eliminating protectionism, enhancing 
transparency in the financial, monetary and trading systems, and committing to an 
open, equitable, rule-based, predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading 
and financial system; 

 5. Recognizes the impacts that the global economic and financial crises are 
still having on the ability of countries, particularly developing countries, to mobilize 
resources for development and to address the impact of these crises, and, in this 
context, calls upon all States and the international community to alleviate, in an 
inclusive and development-oriented manner, any negative impacts of these crises on 
the realization and the effective enjoyment of all human rights;  

 6. Also recognizes that, while globalization offers great opportunities, the 
fact that its benefits are very unevenly shared and its costs unevenly distributed 
represents an aspect of the process that affects the full enjoyment of all human 
rights, in particular in developing countries; 

 7. Welcomes the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights on globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of human 
rights,9 which focuses on the liberalization of agricultural trade and its impact on 
the realization of the right to development, including the right to food, and takes 
note of the conclusions and recommendations contained therein; 

 8. Reaffirms the international commitment to eliminating hunger and to 
securing food for all, today and tomorrow, and reiterates that the relevant United 
Nations organizations should be assured the resources needed to expand and 
enhance their food assistance, and support safety net programmes designed to 
address hunger and malnutrition, when appropriate, through the use of local or 
regional purchase; 

 9. Calls upon Member States, relevant agencies of the United Nations 
system, intergovernmental organizations and civil society to promote equitable and 
environmentally sustainable economic growth for managing globalization so that 
poverty is systematically reduced and the international development targets are 
achieved;

 10. Recognizes that the responsible operations of transnational corporations 
and other business enterprises can contribute to the promotion, protection and 
fulfilment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular economic, 
social and cultural rights; 

 11. Also recognizes that only through broad and sustained efforts, including 
policies and measures at the global level to create a shared future based upon our 
common humanity in all its diversity, can globalization be made fully inclusive and 
equitable and have a human face, thus contributing to the full enjoyment of all 
human rights; 

 12. Underlines the urgent need to establish an equitable, transparent and 
democratic international system to strengthen and broaden the participation of 
developing countries in international economic decision-making and norm-setting; 

 13. Affirms that globalization is a complex process of structural 
transformation, with numerous interdisciplinary aspects, which has an impact on the 
enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right 
to development; 

 14. Also affirms that the international community should strive to respond to 
the challenges and opportunities posed by globalization in a manner that promotes 
and protects human rights while ensuring respect for the cultural diversity of all; 

 15. Underlines, therefore, the need to continue to analyse the consequences 
of globalization for the full enjoyment of all human rights; 

 16. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General,10 and requests him to 
seek further the views of Member States and relevant agencies of the United Nations 
system and to submit to the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session a substantive 
report on the subject based on these views, including recommendations on ways to 
address the impact of globalization on the full enjoyment of all human rights.
