Annex  
 

  Review of the implementation of General Assembly resolution 

72/305 on the strengthening of the Economic and Social Council 
 

 

1. In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, 

the Economic and Social Council should continue to strengthen its leadership and 

policy guidance role, and its role as the central mechanism for coordination of the 

activities of the United Nations development system and its specialized agencies and 

supervision of its subsidiary bodies while integrating their analysis throughout its 

segments. It should also address new and emerging issues in the economic, social, 

environmental and related fields and provide overall support for a balanced 

integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development.   

2. The Economic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies should further 

enhance their contribution to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

Development4 during the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development, 

and to the global response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and its 

impacts, bearing in mind their respective specific functions and mandates. The 

Council should also promote a coordinated follow-up to and implementation of the 

2030 Agenda in its entirety and the outcomes of other major United Nations 

conferences and summits in the economic, social, environmental and related fields.  

To that end, the Council should ensure that the agenda, work programme and 

discussions in its segments and forums and its subsidiary bodies contribute to their 

implementation as well as the response to major challenges to the achievement of 

sustainable development such as the COVID-19 pandemic, while ensuring that 

subsidiary bodies deliver on their specific mandates and functions.  

3. The General Assembly shall continue to adopt one common main theme for the 

Economic and Social Council and the high-level political forum on sustainable 

development under its auspices, bearing in mind the provisions of resolution 70/299 

of 29 July 2016 and the provisions of paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of the annex to resolution 

72/305 of 23 July 2018. The themes of the segments of the Council shall focus on a 

particular aspect of the one main theme, bearing in mind their respective functions. 

The humanitarian affairs segment shall continue to adopt themes based on 

humanitarian considerations and that are coherent with the main theme of the Council.  

The subsidiary bodies of the Council shall similarly decide on their own respective 

themes, aligned with the main theme, while continuing to address issues or a theme 

necessary to discharge their other functions.  

4. The Economic and Social Council should provide integrated policy guidance on 

the follow-up to and operationalization of the intergovernmentally negotiated 

ministerial declaration of the Economic and Social Council and the high -level 

political forum on sustainable development and of the findings of the high-level 

political forum, notably its thematic reviews and voluntary national reviews, bearing 

in mind the unique role of the Council as a Charter body entrusted with the 

coordination of the United Nations system. To support this work, the Secretary -

General should include in his report to the Council on the main theme lessons learned 

from the thematic reviews and voluntary national reviews following the conclusion 

of the July high-level political forum, with recommendations for follow-up by 

countries, various segments and forums of the Council, the United Nations system 

and relevant stakeholders. The Council will also discuss issues on the economic, 

social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development and their 

implications for the theme of the Council and the high-level political forum and the

implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The Council should place a focus on the poorest 

and most vulnerable, including those in vulnerable situations, to ensure that no one is 

left behind in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. 

5. The Economic and Social Council segments and its reports, work programmes 

and outcomes should give adequate attention to the special challenges facing the most 

vulnerable countries and, in particular, African countries, least developed cou ntries, 

landlocked developing countries, small island developing States and countries in 

conflict and post-conflict situations, as well as the specific challenges facing middle -

income countries, in pursuing sustainable development. The reports of the Secre tary-

General should adequately address the diverse needs and specific challenges facing 

these developing countries, as appropriate.  

6. The Economic and Social Council cycle will continue to run from July to July. 

To promote linkages in their work and enhance the visibility and impact of the 

Council, and to encourage focus, coherence and efficiency, the Council segments and 

forums shall be structured into four groups per Council cycle.  

7. The first group, to be held by early February each year, will compri se the 

partnership forum and the coordination segment.  

8. The second group will comprise Economic and Social Council forums. It will 

include, annually, the forum on financing for development follow-up, the 

multi-stakeholder forum on science, technology and innovation for the Sustainable 

Development Goals, the youth forum and other related mandated meetings. The 

Development Cooperation Forum will continue to be convened every two years 

before the forum on financing for development follow-up, with the next forum to be 

convened in 2023.  

9. The third group will comprise segments that address actions by the United 

Nations development system and other actors to implement the 2030 Agenda, along 

with distinct humanitarian assistance. It will include the operational activities for 

development segment, the humanitarian affairs segment and the meeting on the 

transition from relief to development. These will be organized independently and in 

a coordinated manner. 

10. The fourth group will comprise segments and forums that provide overall policy 

guidance and foster progress in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, contribute to 

the overall review of the 2030 Agenda at the high-level political forum and look to 

the future of the advancement of sustainable development. It  will include the high-

level political forum on sustainable development and the high-level segment of the 

Economic and Social Council.  

11. As mandated in the past, the Economic and Social Council may convene special 

sessions to address urgent developments in the economic, social, environmental and 

related fields that may require guidance and coordination by the Council. It should 

also continue to convene ad hoc meetings on specific humanitarian emergencies at 

the request of the affected country or following a recommendation of the Bureau. 

Such ad hoc meetings should raise awareness and promote the engagement of all 

relevant stakeholders, including the United Nations system, in support of 

international relief efforts aimed at addressing those emergencies.  

12. The working modalities of the Economic and Social Council should be guided 

by the principles of inclusiveness, transparency and flexibility based on the 

deliberative functions of its meetings. It should be a platform for discussion and the 

exchange of national experiences. The Council should aim at creating synergy and 

coherence as well as avoiding duplication and overlap in its work to ensure efficiency 

and effectiveness.  



A/75/L.X 
 

 

21-07895 6/9 

 

13. In supporting the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and delivering on its other 

functions, the Economic and Social Council should work towards the eradication of 

poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, as the greatest 

global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development.  The 

Council should also strengthen its efforts to mainstream a gender perspective across 

its agenda, work programme, meetings and documentation.  

14. With a view to ensuring a streamlined consideration of related agenda items and 

optimal use of available time, the Bureau of the Economic and Social Council is 

invited to prepare a focused programme of work, including possible joint 

consideration of related items, that enhances deliberation among Member States. The 

programme of work and agenda of each segment/forum should be circulated as early 

as possible. The Bureau of the Council should make efforts to ensure that meetings 

and informal consultations are planned during United Nations working hours to better 

facilitate the active and constructive participation of all permanent missions in the 

work of the United Nations. 

15. The partnership forum of the Economic and Social Council will be convened 

for one day by early February, back-to-back with the coordination segment. The 

partnership forum will engage countries, the United Nations system, including 

international financial institutions, as well as international organizations, 

parliamentarians, local governments, non-governmental organizations, the private 

sector, civil society, scientists, academia, women, youth and other stakeholders. The 

partnership forum will be organized in consultation with stakeholders and allow 

interactive discussions among all stakeholders on the main theme of the Council and 

the high-level political forum on sustainable development. The partnership forum will 

be focused on the exchange of new ideas, expectations and priorities for the work 

ahead for the Council cycle and the high-level political forum held under the auspices 

of the Council. The partnership forum will also discuss forward-looking actions by 

countries and all relevant stakeholders as well as innovative partnerships that can 

mobilize commitments and actions to advance the 2030 Agenda.   

16. The way that the Economic and Social Council delivers on its coordination 

function should be strengthened so as to help to ensure that the United Nations system 

and subsidiary bodies of the Council contribute fully to the decade of action and 

delivery for sustainable development and the global response to the COVID-19 

pandemic. To this end, the coordination segment shall replace the integration segment 

and the informal meeting of the Council with the Chairs of the subsidiary bodies and 

will be held annually for up to two days by early February, before the first session of 

a subsidiary body of the Council. Through this segment, the Council will take up 

coordination matters arising from subsidiary bodies, principal organs and specialized 

agencies in the economic, social, environmental and related fields.  It will steer the 

Council system towards an efficient and integrated workflow throughout the Council 

cycle leading up to the high-level political forum on sustainable development. It will 

provide forward-looking policy guidance to ensure coherence and direction in the 

policies and normative work of subsidiary bodies and specialized agencies relating to 

the 2030 Agenda as well as to other aspects of the work of the Council.   

17. The coordination segment will formulate common action-oriented policy 

guidance on all matters requiring implementation or coordination efforts (i) by the 

Economic and Social Council functional and regional commissions and other 

subsidiary bodies as well as (ii) by the United Nations system, notably the specialized 

agencies, in the policy and normative area, including detailed guidance on the 

implementation of the intergovernmentally negotiated ministerial declaration of the 

previous year. In coordinating the policy and normative work of the specialized 

agencies and other United Nations system entities as envisioned by Article 63 of the 

Charter, the Council will avoid overlap with the operational activities for 



 
A/75/L.X 

 

7/9 21-07895 

 

development segment, which provides guidance on operational activities of the 

United Nations development system.  

18. The coordination segment will examine key policy issues, lessons learned, best 

practices and recommendations emanating from the work of the Economic and Social 

Council subsidiary bodies, including regional commissions, during the previous 

cycle. It will allow the Council to address issues identified by subsidiary  bodies as 

requiring the attention of the Council at the global level and to build on the policy 

conclusions of its subsidiary bodies, along with inputs of the United Nations system, 

so as to promote the balanced integration of the three dimensions of sustainable 

development. It will also provide guidance and coordination to subsidiary bodies, 

ensuring a clearer division of labour among them, aligning their work with the 

implementation of the 2030 Agenda and promoting their implementation of the 

intergovernmentally negotiated ministerial declaration of the previous year, bearing 

in mind the respective mandates and functions of those bodies. The coordination 

segment will furthermore provide detailed guidance to the subsidiary bodies of the 

Council and the United Nations system on their upcoming work on the main theme 

and develop action-oriented assessment and recommendations so that those bodies 

best contribute to the preparations for the thematic review of the high-level political 

forum on sustainable development. It will review how subsidiary bodies and the 

United Nations system work on the interlinkages among the Sustainable Development 

Goals and the integrated implementation of the 2030 Agenda, guiding their work for 

the rest of the Council cycle.  

19. During the coordination segment, the Economic and Social Council will also 

hold a discussion on the following existing coordination-related mandated agenda 

items that have been thus far considered during the management segment:  

 (a) Mainstreaming a gender perspective into all policies and programmes in 

the United Nations system (item 12 (c) of the Economic and Social Council agenda); 

 (b) Implementation of General Assembly resolutions 50/227, 52/12 B, 57/270 B, 

60/265, 61/16, 67/290, 68/1 and 72/305 on strengthening of the Economic and Social 

Council.  

20. An informal note will be prepared by the Secretariat to inform the discussions 

at the coordination segment. This note should include (i) integrated policy analysis 

emanating from the work of the subsidiary bodies of the Economic and Social Council 

during the previous cycle and proposed guidance for  their contributions to the 

implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the decade of action and delivery for 

sustainable development; (ii) coordination issues emanating from the work of 

subsidiary bodies and the policy and normative activities of specialized ag encies and 

other United Nations system entities and recommendations for addressing them; and 

(iii) proposals related to the implementation of the intergovernmentally negotiated 

ministerial declaration of the Council of the previous cycle and lessons learned from 

the thematic reviews and voluntary national reviews at the high-level political forum 

on sustainable development, with recommendations for follow-up by countries, 

various segments and forums of the Council, the United Nations system and relevant 

stakeholders.  

21. Heads of United Nations system entities, Chairs of the subsidiary bodies of the 

Economic and Social Council and Executive Secretaries of the regional commissions 

will be invited to participate. Non-governmental organizations in consultative status 

with the Council should – and the private sector and other stakeholders involved in 

the policy and normative work of the United Nations system and the subsidiary bodies 

may – be engaged in the coordination segment, while retaining the intergovernmental 

nature of the Council.
