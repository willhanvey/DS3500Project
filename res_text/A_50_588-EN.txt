following draft resolution:

the survival of civilization,

Welcoming the progress achieved in recent years in both nuclear and
conventional disarmament,

Noting that, despite recent progress in the field of nuclear disarmament,
further efforts are necessary towards the achievement of the goal of general and
complete disarmament under effective international control,

nuclear weapons are essential to remove the danger of nuclear war,

Determined strictly to abide by the relevant provisions of the Charter of

non-nuclear-weapon States need to be safeguarded against the use or threat of
use of force, including the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons,

Considering that, until nuclear disarmament is achieved on a universal
basis, it is imperative for the international community to develop effective
measures and arrangements to ensure the security of non-nuclear-weapon States
against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons from any quarter,

 Recognizing also that effective measures and arrangements to assure the
non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons
can contribute positively to the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons,

Noting the support expressed in the Conference on Disarmament and in the

although the difficulties as regards evolving a common approach acceptable to
all have also been pointed out;

3. Appeals to all States, especially the nuclear-weapon States, to work

a common formula that could be included in an international instrument of a
legally binding character;

continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and

giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same
objective;

6. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-first
session the item entitled "Conclusion of effective international arrangements to
assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear
