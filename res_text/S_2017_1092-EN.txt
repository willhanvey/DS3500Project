  United States of America: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous relevant resolutions, including resolution 825 (1993), 

resolution 1695 (2006), resolution 1718 (2006), resolution 1874 (2009), resolution 

1887 (2009), resolution 2087 (2013), resolution 2094 (2013), resolution 2270 (2016), 

resolution 2321 (2016), resolution 2356 (2017), resolution 2371 (2017), resolution 

2375 (2017), as well as the statements of its President of 6 October 2006 

(S/PRST/2006/41), 13 April 2009 (S/PRST/2009/7), 16 April 2012 (S/PRST/2012/13), 

and 29 August 2017 (S/PRST/2017/16),  

 Reaffirming that proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as 

well as their means of delivery, constitutes a threat to international peace and security,  

 Expressing its gravest concern at the ballistic missile launch by the Democratic 

People’s Republic of Korea (“the DPRK”) on 28 November 2017 in violation of 

resolutions 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009), 2087 (2013), 2094 (2013), 2270 (2016) 2321 

(2016), 2356 (2017), 2371 (2017), and 2375 (2017) and at the challenge such a test 

constitutes to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (“the NPT”) and 

to international efforts aimed at strengthening the global regime of non-proliferation 

of nuclear weapons, and the danger it poses to peace and stability in the region and 

beyond, 

 Underlining once again the importance that the DPRK respond to other security 

and humanitarian concerns of the international community including the necessity of 

the DPRK respecting and ensuring the welfare, inherent dignity, and rights of people 

in the DPRK, and expressing great concern that the DPRK continues to develop 

nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles by diverting critically needed resources away 

from the people in the DPRK at tremendous cost when they have great unmet needs,  

 Acknowledging that the proceeds of the DPRK’s trade in sectoral goods, 

including but not limited to coal, iron, iron ore, lead, lead ore, textiles, seafood, gold, 

silver, rare earth minerals, and other prohibited metals, as well as the revenue 

generated from DPRK workers overseas, among others, contribute to the DPRK’s 

nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs,  

 Expressing its gravest concern that the DPRK’s ongoing nuclear- and ballistic 

missile-related activities have destabilized the region and beyond, and determining 

that there continues to exist a clear threat to international peace and security,  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, and taking 

measures under Article 41,

light of the DPRK’s compliance, and, in this regard, expresses its determination to 

take further significant measures in the event of a further DPRK nuclear test or 

launch, and decides that, if the DPRK conducts a further nuclear test or a launch of a 

ballistic missile system capable of reaching intercontinental ranges or contributing to 

the development of a ballistic missile system capable of such ranges, then the Security
