 The Security Council,  

 Recalling its primary responsibility under the Charter of the United Nations 
for the maintenance of international peace and security, and noting the significance 
of small arms and light weapons as the most frequently used weapons in the 
majority of recent armed conflicts,  

 Recalling the statements of its President of 19 March 2010 (S/PRST/2010/6), 
of 14 January 2009 (S/PRST/2009/1), of 29 June 2007 (S/PRST/2007/24), of  
17 February 2005 (S/PRST/2005/7), of 19 January 2004 (S/PRST/2004/1), of  
31 October 2002 (S/PRST/2002/30), of 31 August 2001 (S/PRST/2001/21) and of 
24 September 1999 (S/PRST/1999/28), as well as other relevant resolutions of the 
Council, including that of 16 September 1998 (S/RES/1196 (1998)) and statements 
of its President related to small arms and light weapons,  

 Emphasizing that the right of individual and collective self-defence recognized 
in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations and the legitimate security 
demands of all countries should be fully taken into account, and recognizing that 
small arms and light weapons are traded, manufactured and retained by States for 
legitimate security, sporting and commercial considerations,  

 Gravely concerned that the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and 
misuse of small arms and light weapons in many regions of the world continue to 
pose threats to international peace and security, cause significant loss of life, 
contribute to instability and insecurity and continue to undermine the effectiveness 
of the Security Council in discharging its primary responsibility for the maintenance 
of international peace and security,  

 Recognizing that threats arising from the illicit transfer, destabilizing 
accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons may vary according to 
national, regional and subregional circumstances and encouraging responses that 
address prevailing needs and challenges,  

 Recognizing the importance of capacity-building to address threats arising 
from the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and

light weapons, especially in Africa, welcoming efforts that have been made by 
States, international, regional and subregional organizations to tackle this scourge, 
and strongly encouraging support for such efforts,  

 Emphasizing the importance of assisting Member States as well as, 
intergovernmental, regional and subregional organizations in capacity-building to 
prevent and address the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of 
small arms and light weapons,  

 Recalling with concern the close connection between international terrorism, 
transnational organized crime, drugs trafficking, money-laundering, other illicit 
financial transactions, illicit brokering in small arms and light weapons and arms 
trafficking, and the link between the illegal exploitation of natural resources, illicit 
trade in such resources and the proliferation and trafficking of arms as a major 
factor fuelling and exacerbating many conflicts,  

 Expressing concern at the continuing threats posed by the illicit transfer, 
destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons to the safety 
and security of United Nations peacekeepers and their effectiveness in implementing 
peacekeeping mandates, and to the safety and security of humanitarian workers and 
their effective provision of humanitarian assistance,  

 Recalling with grave concern that the illicit transfer, destabilizing 
accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons fuel armed conflicts and 
have a wide range of negative human rights, humanitarian, development and 
socioeconomic consequences, in particular on the security of civilians in armed 
conflict, including the disproportionate impact on violence perpetrated against 
women and girls, and exacerbating sexual and gender-based violence and the 
recruitment and use of children by parties to armed conflict in violation of 
applicable international law,  

 Noting that this resolution focuses on the illicit transfer, destabilizing 
accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons, including in respect of 
Council-mandated arms embargoes,  

 Acknowledging the important contribution of Council-mandated arms 
embargoes in countering the illicit transfer of small arms and light weapons, 
mitigating the intensity of conflict and creating conditions conducive to the peaceful 
resolution of situations that threaten or breach international peace and security, and 
acknowledging also the contribution Council-mandated arms embargoes make in 
supporting conflict prevention, post-conflict peacebuilding, disarmament, 
demobilization and reintegration and security sector reform,  

 Recognizing the value of effective physical security and management of 
stockpiles of small arms, light weapons and ammunition as an important means to 
prevent the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and 
light weapons, in accordance with global and regional standards, including through 
the application of voluntary guidelines, such as the International Ammunition 
Technical Guidelines (IATG) developed under the UN SaferGuard programme, and 
the International Small Arms Control Standards (ISACS) in arms and ammunition 
stockpile management practices,  

 Emphasizing the importance of addressing the illicit transfer, destabilizing 
accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons in conflict prevention and 



 S/2013/570

post-conflict peacebuilding, and in this context, stressing the importance of 
comprehensive international, regional and national approaches to disarmament, 
demobilization and reintegration that integrates political, social, economic, 
development and security aspects, and provides for the special needs of children and 
women, and women’s full and effective participation in all efforts for the 
maintenance and promotion of peace and security, in line with UNSCR 1325 
(S/RES/1325 (2000)),  

 Underlining the responsibility of States to prevent threats posed by the illicit 
transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons to 
international peace and security, and the devastating impact on civilians in armed 
conflict,  

 Recognizing that the misuse of small arms and light weapons has resulted in 
grave crimes and reaffirming therefore the relevant provisions of the 2005 World 
Summit Outcome Document regarding the protection of civilians in armed conflict, 
including paragraphs 138 and 139 thereof regarding the responsibility to protect 
populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against 
humanity,  

 Noting with appreciation the efforts made by Member States, 
intergovernmental, regional and subregional organizations in addressing threats to 
international peace and security posed by the illicit transfer, destabilizing 
accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons, and noting the 
significant role of civil society in supporting such efforts,  

 Underlining in this regard the importance of cooperation, coordination and 
information-sharing among actors in addressing threats to international peace and 
security posed by the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small 
arms and light weapons,  

 Recognizing the significance and central role of the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocols, including the 
Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts 
and Components and Ammunition; the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat 
and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects; 
and the International Instrument to Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely 
and Reliable Manner, Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons, as crucial instruments 
in countering the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small 
arms and light weapons,  

 Acknowledging the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty, taking note of the 
signature and ratification of the Treaty by some States, and looking forward to the 
important contribution it can make to international and regional peace, security and 
stability, reducing human suffering and promoting cooperation,  

 Welcoming the increased cooperation between the United Nations and 
INTERPOL, including the 2009 Supplementary Agreement between INTERPOL and 
the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations, as well as individual 
agreements between INTERPOL and Council Sanctions Committees, which provide 
better optional tools including, those for weapons identification and information 
sharing, for the United Nations and Member States to implement Council-mandated 
arms embargoes more effectively,
