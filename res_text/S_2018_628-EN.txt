  Peru: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council,  

 Reaffirming its determination to combat impunity for all those responsible for 

serious international crimes and the necessity of all persons indicted by the 

International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), and the International Tribunal 

for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) being brought to justice and, in this regard, 

recalling the mandate of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals 

(Mechanism) established by resolution 1966 (2010) of 22 December 2010,  

 Recalling the Security Council Press Statement of 31 December 2017, 

 Recalling Article 25 and Article 26 of the Statute of the Mechanism, set out in 

Annex 1 to resolution 1966 (2010), concerning the supervision of the enforcement of 

sentences and pardon or commutation of sentences, respectively,  

 Having regard to Article 14, paragraph 4 of the Statute of the Mechanism,  

 Recalling its decision in resolution 2269 (2016) adopted on 29 February 2016 

appointing the Prosecutor of the Mechanism for a period from 1 March 2016 until 

30 June 2018, and that the Prosecutor of the Mechanism may be appointed or 

reappointed for a two-year term, notwithstanding Article 14, paragraph 4 of the 

Statute of the Mechanism,  

 Having considered the nomination by the Secretary-General to Mr. Serge 

Brammertz as Prosecutor of the Mechanism (S/2018/626),  

 Noting with concern that the Mechanism faces problems in the relocation of 

acquitted persons and convicted persons who have completed serving their sentences,  

and emphasizing the importance of the successful relocation of such persons,  

 Recalling its decision by resolution 1966 (2010) that the Mechanism shall 

operate for an initial period of four years from the first commencement date referred 

to in paragraph 1 of the resolution, and to review the progress of the work of the 

Mechanism, including in completing its functions, before the end of this initial period 

and every two years thereafter, and that the Mechanism shall continue to operate for 

subsequent periods of two years following each such review, unless the Security 

Council decides otherwise,  

 Noting that the current period of operation of the Mechanism ends on 30 June 

2018,

December 2015, pursuant to paragraph 17 of resolution 1966 (2010) and in 

accordance with the procedure set out in the statement of its President of 19 March 

2018 (S/PRST/2018/6),  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 1. Decides to appoint Mr. Serge Brammertz as Prosecutor of the International 

Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals with effect from 1 July 2018 until 

30 June 2020;  

 2. Underlines that States should cooperate fully with the Mechanism;  

 3. Commends States that have accepted the relocation of acquitted persons or 

convicted persons who have completed serving their sentences to their territori es, and 

reiterates its call upon all States to cooperate with and render all necessary assistance 

to the Mechanism, for increased efforts towards the relocation of acquitted persons 

and convicted persons who have completed serving their sentences;  

 4. Urges all States, especially States where fugitives are suspected to be at 

large, to intensify their cooperation with and render all necessary assistance to the 

Mechanism, in particular to achieve the arrest and surrender of all remaining fugitives 

indicted by the ICTR as soon as possible;  

 5. Emphasizes that, in view of the substantially reduced nature of the residual 

functions, the Mechanism was established to be a small, temporary and efficient 

structure, whose functions and size will diminish over time, with a small number of 

staff commensurate with its reduced functions, and, recognizing in this regard the full 

commitment to these elements expressed by the Mechanism, urges the Mechanism to 

continue to be guided in its activities by these elements;  

 6. Welcomes the report (S/2018/347) submitted by the Mechanism to the 

Council pursuant to its Presidential Statement (S/PRST/2018/6) for the purposes of 

the review of the progress of the work of the Mechanism, including in completing its 

functions, as required by paragraph 17 of resolution 1966 of 22 December 2010, and 

the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) on the evaluation of 

the methods and work of the Mechanism (S/2018/206);  

 7. Takes note of the work of the Mechanism to date, in particular 

development of a legal and regulatory framework, procedures, and working practices 

consistent with the Statute of the Mechanism and drawing on lessons learned from 

and best practices of the ICTY and ICTR and of other tribunals, including its 

implementation of the double-hatting of personnel, use of rosters to ensure judges and 

staff are utilized only when required, enabling judges and staff to work remotely to 

the maximum extent possible, and minimizing the need for full bench participation in 

pre-trial and pre-appeal hearing work, in order to produce substantial reductions in 

the costs of judicial activities compared to those of the ICTY and ICTR, and 

commends the Mechanism for its efforts to produce such reductions;  

 8. Notes further the views and recommendations made with regard to the 

Mechanism’s work by the Council’s Informal Working Group on International 

Tribunals, as reflected in this resolution, and requests the Mechanism to take into 

account those views and implement the recommendations, and to continue to take 

steps, such as those referred to in paragraph 7, to further enhance efficiency and 

effective and transparent management, in particular: (i) full implementation of the 

outstanding recommendations of the OIOS; (ii) production of more focused 

projections of completion timelines and disciplined adherence thereto, including by 

making the best use of the diverse approaches of common law and civil law systems; 

(iii) enhancement of the geographic diversity and gender balance of staff, while 

ensuring continued professional expertise; (iv) implementation of a human resources

policy consistent with its temporary mandate; and (v) further reduction of costs, 

including through, but not limited to, flexible staff engagement;  

 9. Reiterates its request to the Mechanism to include in its six-monthly 

reports to the Council information on progress achieved in impleme nting this 

resolution, as well as detailed information on the staffing of the Mechanism, 

respective workload and related costs with breakdown by division and detailed 

projections of the duration of residual functions based on available data;  

 10. Notes the views and concerns expressed by some Member States during 

the Security Council debate on 6 June 2018 about the current approach of the 

Mechanism to early release of persons convicted by the ICTR, and encourages the 

Mechanism to consider an appropriate solution, including by considering putting in 

place conditions on early release in appropriate cases;  

 11. Notes the conclusion of the Council’s review of the progress of the work 

of the Mechanism, including in completing its functions, since the last revie w of the 

Mechanism in December 2015, pursuant to resolution 1966 (2010);  

 12. Recalls, with a view to strengthening independent oversight of the 

Mechanism, that, as set out in its Presidential Statement of 19 March 2018 

(S/PRST/2018/6), future reviews carried out pursuant to paragraph 17 of resolution 

1966 (2010) shall include evaluation reports sought from the OIOS with respect to 

the methods and work of the Mechanism;  

 13. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
