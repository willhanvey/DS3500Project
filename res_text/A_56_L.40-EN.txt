Recognizing that the eradication of colonialism has been one of the priorities
of the Organization and continues to be one of its priorities for the decade that
begins in 2001,

Reconfirming the need to take measures to eliminate colonialism before 2010,
as called for in its resolution 55/146 of 8 December 2000,

administering Powers in the work of the Special Committee,

Noting that the other administering Powers have now agreed to work
