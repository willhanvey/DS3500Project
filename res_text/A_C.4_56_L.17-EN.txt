Aware of the responsibility of the international community to promote human
rights and ensure respect for international law,

Reaffirming the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory
by force,

Reaffirming also the applicability of the Geneva Convention relative to the
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949,5 to the Occupied
Palestinian Territory, including Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied by
Israel since 1967,

Stressing the need for compliance with the Israeli-Palestinian agreements
reached within the context of the Middle East peace process, as well as for the
immediate and full implementation of the recommendations of the Sharm El-Sheikh
Fact-Finding Committee (Mitchell report),

Noting that during the reporting period, the third agreed-upon phase of
redeployment of the Israeli army has not been implemented, and that serious
incursions into the areas under the full control of the Palestinian Authority have
occurred,

Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the
Palestinian people by Israel, the occupying Power, including the use of collective
punishment, closure of areas, annexation of land, establishment of settlements and
the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status, geographical nature
and demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including
Jerusalem,

Deeply concerned by the tragic events that have occurred since 28 September
2000 and have led to numerous deaths and injuries, mostly among Palestinians, the
severe restrictions on the movement of persons and goods, and the widespread
destruction, including of agricultural land,

Convinced of the positive impact of a temporary international or foreign
presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory for the safety and protection of the
Palestinian people,

Convinced also of the need for third-party monitoring to help the parties to
implement the recommendations of the Sharm El-Sheikh Fact-Finding Committee,

Expressing its appreciation to the countries that participated in the Temporary
International Presence in Hebron for their positive contribution,

Convinced of the need for the full implementation of Security Council
resolutions 904 (1994), 1073 (1996) and 1322 (2000),

1. Determines that all measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying
Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including Jerusalem, in violation of the
relevant provisions of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian
Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949,5 and contrary to the relevant resolutions
of the Security Council, are illegal and have no validity;

2. Demands that the measures and actions taken in violation of the Fourth
Geneva Convention of 19495 cease immediately, including the practice of
extrajudicial killings;

3. Condemns acts of violence, especially the excessive use of force by
Israeli forces against Palestinian civilians, resulting in extensive loss of life, vast
numbers of injuries and massive destruction;

4. Demands that Israel, the occupying Power, cease all practices and actions
which violate the human rights of the Palestinian people;

5. Stresses the need to preserve the territorial integrity of all the Occupied
Palestinian Territory and to guarantee the freedom of movement of persons and
goods within the Palestinian territory, including the removal of restrictions on
movement into and from East Jerusalem, and the freedom of movement to and from
the outside world;

6. Calls for complete respect by Israel, the occupying Power, of all
fundamental freedoms of the Palestinian people;

7. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its
fifty-seventh session on the implementation of the present resolution.
