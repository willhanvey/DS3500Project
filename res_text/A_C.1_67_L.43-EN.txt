 The General Assembly,

before, 

 Encouraged by the signing of the Treaty by one hundred and eighty-three 
States, including forty-one of the forty-four whose ratification is needed for its entry

 Recalling its resolution 66/64 of 2 December 2011, 

 Welcoming the adoption by consensus of the conclusions and recommendations 
for follow-on actions of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on 
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,1 which, inter alia, reaffirmed the vital 
importance of the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as 
a core element of the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation 
regime and included specific actions to be taken in support of the entry into force of 
the Treaty, 

 Recalling the Final Declaration adopted by the seventh Conference on

elements of the verification regime;

entry into force of the Treaty;
