 Reaffirming that regional cooperation plays a fundamental role in promoting 

and protecting human rights and should reinforce universal human rights, as 

contained in international human rights instruments, and their protection,   

 Noting that the developments in the Middle East and North Africa have 

continued to generate growing demand for the services of the Centre, and 

recognizing that the report of the Secretary-General
4
 indicates that regular budget 

resources have been allocated to reinforce the staffing capacity of the Centre, 

thereby enabling it to better respond to training and documentation demands in a 

more timely and adequate manner, and to help to fill the gaps in terms of expertise 

and relevant Arabic-language training materials,  

 Mindful of the vastness and the diversity of the needs in the field of human 

rights within South-West Asia and the Arab region, and taking into account the need 

for appropriate and sustainable funding of the Centre to fully realize its significant 

function and crucial role in the region,  

 1. Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General;

 2. Notes with appreciation the successful assistance that the United Nations 

Human Rights Training and Documentation Centre for South-West Asia and the 

Arab Region has provided through human rights capacity-building activities, 

technical assistance programmes and training programmes on combating human 

trafficking, human rights and media, human rights and diplomacy, human rights 

education and police training on human rights, as well as support to national human 

rights institutions and regional consultations on the topics of United Nations human 

rights mechanisms;  

 3. Underlines the Centre’s role as a source for regional expertise and the 

need to meet an increasing number of requests for training and documentation, 

including in the Arabic language;  

 4. Notes that the increasing demand that has been placed on the Centre by 

Member States and other stakeholders reveals a growing recognition of its role and 

impact on strengthening human rights capacities in the region;   

 5. Encourages the continued engagement of the Centre to work with other 

United Nations regional offices to strengthen its work and to avoid duplication;   

 6. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its 

seventy-second session a report, in accordance with existing rules and procedures, 

on the implementation of the present resolution.
