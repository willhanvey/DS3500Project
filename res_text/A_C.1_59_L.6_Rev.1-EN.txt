The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolutions 54/54 F of 1 December 1999, 55/33 A of
20 November 2000, 56/24 B of 29 November 2001, and 57/71 of 22 November 2002
and 58/37 of 8 December 2003,

Reaffirming the role of the United Nations in the field of arms regulation and
disarmament and the commitment of Member States to take concrete steps to
strengthen that role,

Realizing the need to promote regional and international peace and security in
a world free from the scourge of war and the burden of armaments,

Convinced of the need for a comprehensive approach towards missiles, in a
balanced and non-discriminatory manner, as a contribution to international peace
and security,

Bearing in mind that the security concerns of Member States at the
international and regional levels should be taken into consideration in addressing the
issue of missiles,

Underlining the complexities involved in considering the issue of missiles in
the conventional context,

Expressing its support for the international efforts against the development and
proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction,

Considering that the Secretary-General, in response to resolution 58/37,
established in 2004 a Panel of Governmental Experts, which had a comprehensive,
in-depth exchange of views on the issue of missiles in all its aspects,



2

A/C.1/59/L.6/Rev.1

Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on the issue of missiles in
all its aspects,1 in which he stated that given the complexity of the issues at hand, no
consensus was reached on the preparation of a final report by the Panel,

1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General containing the replies
from Member States on the report on the issue of missiles in all its aspects,
submitted pursuant to resolution 58/37;2

2. Requests the Secretary-General to prepare a report, with the support of
qualified consultants and the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, as
appropriate, taking into account the views expressed by Member States, to
contribute to the United Nations endeavour to address the issue of missiles in all its
aspects, by identifying areas where consensus can be reached, and to submit it to the
General Assembly at its sixty-first session;

3. Also requests the Secretary-General, with the assistance of a Panel of
Governmental Experts, to be established in 2007 on the basis of equitable
geographical distribution, to explore further ways and means to address within the
United Nations the issue of missiles in all its aspects, including identifying areas
where consensus can be reached, and to submit a report for consideration by the
General Assembly at its sixty-third session;

4. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixtieth session the
item entitled “Missiles”.
