  Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of

specialized agencies and the international institutions

 The General Assembly, 

 Having considered the item entitled “Implementation of the Declaration on the 
Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized 
agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations”, 

 Having also considered the report of the Secretary-General1 and the report of 
the Economic and Social Council2 on the item, 

 Having examined the chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the 
Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of 
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples relating to the item,3 

 Recalling its resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 and 1541 (XV) of

the Special Committee on specific Territories, 

 Noting that only some specialized agencies and other organizations of the 
United Nations system have been involved in providing assistance to Non-Self-
Governing Territories, 

 Stressing that, because the development options of the small island Non-Self-
Governing Territories are limited, there are special challenges to planning for and 
implementing sustainable development and that those Territories will be constrained 
in meeting the challenges without the continuing cooperation and assistance of the 
specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, 

 Stressing also the importance of securing the necessary resources for funding 
expanded programmes of assistance for the peoples concerned and the need to enlist 
the support of all major funding institutions within the United Nations system in that 
regard, 

 Reaffirming the mandates of the specialized agencies and other organizations 
of the United Nations system to take all appropriate measures, within their 
respective spheres of competence, to ensure the full implementation of General 
Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant resolutions, 

 Expressing its appreciation to the African Union, the Pacific Islands Forum, 
the Caribbean Community and other regional organizations for the continued 
cooperation and assistance they have extended to the specialized agencies and other 
organizations of the United Nations system in this regard, 

 Expressing its conviction that closer contacts and consultations between and 
among the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations 
system and regional organizations help to facilitate the effective formulation of 
programmes of assistance to the peoples concerned, 

 Mindful of the imperative need to keep under continuous review the activities 
of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system in 
the implementation of the various United Nations resolutions and decisions relating 
to decolonization, 

 Bearing in mind the extremely fragile economies of the small island Non-Self-
Governing Territories and their vulnerability to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, 
cyclones and sea-level rise, and recalling the relevant resolutions of the General 
Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 61/231 of 22 December 2006 on the implementation of 
the Declaration by the specialized agencies and the international institutions 
associated with the United Nations, 

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;1

Nations; 



A/62/410

institutions of the United Nations system should continue to be guided by the 
relevant resolutions of the United Nations in their efforts to contribute to the 
implementation of the Declaration and all other relevant resolutions of the General

 4. Reaffirms also that the recognition by the General Assembly, the Security

determination entails, as a corollary, the extension of all appropriate assistance to 
those peoples; 

 5. Expresses its appreciation to those specialized agencies and other 
organizations of the United Nations system that have continued to cooperate with 
the United Nations and the regional and subregional organizations in the

resolutions of the United Nations, and requests all the specialized agencies and other 
organizations of the United Nations system to implement the relevant provisions of 
those resolutions; 

 6. Requests the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United 
Nations system and international and regional organizations to examine and review 
conditions in each Territory so as to take appropriate measures to accelerate 
progress in the economic and social sectors of the Territories; 

 7. Urges those specialized agencies and other organizations of the United 
Nations system that have not yet provided assistance to Non-Self-Governing 
Territories to do so as soon as possible; 

 8. Requests the specialized agencies and other organizations and institutions 
of the United Nations system and regional organizations to strengthen existing

cooperation of the regional organizations concerned, concrete proposals for the full

necessary mechanisms for its associate members, including Non-Self-Governing 
Territories, to participate in the special sessions of the General Assembly, subject to
