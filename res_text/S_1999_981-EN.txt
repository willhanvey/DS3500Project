Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 8 September 1999
(S/1999/957) submitted to the Security Council in accordance with the above-
mentioned statement,

Taking note of the reports of the Secretary-General of 13 April 1998 on the

Noting that civilians account for the vast majority of casualties in armed
conflicts and are increasingly targeted by combatants and armed elements,
gravely concerned by the hardships borne by civilians during armed conflict, in
particular as a result of acts of violence directed against them, especially
women, children and other vulnerable groups, including refugees and internally
displaced persons, and recognizing the consequent impact this will have on
durable peace, reconciliation and development,

Bearing in mind its primary responsibility under the Charter of the United
Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security, and underlining
the importance of taking measures aimed at conflict prevention and resolution,

Stressing the need to address the causes of armed conflict in a
comprehensive manner in order to enhance the protection of civilians on a long-
term basis, including by promoting economic growth, poverty eradication,
sustainable development, national reconciliation, good governance, democracy,
the rule of law and respect for and protection of human rights,

Expressing its deep concern at the erosion in respect for international
humanitarian, human rights and refugee law and principles during armed conflict,
