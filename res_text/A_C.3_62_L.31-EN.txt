 The General Assembly, 

 Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
and expressing, in particular, the need to achieve international cooperation in 
promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for

 Recalling the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 as well as the Vienna

Rights on 25 June 1993,2 

 Recalling also the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights3 and

 Recalling further the Declaration on the Right to Development adopted by the 
General Assembly in its resolution 41/128 of 4 December 1986, 

 Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration4 and the outcome 
documents of the twenty-third5 and twenty-fourth6 special sessions of the General 
Assembly, held in New York from 5 to 10 June 2000 and in Geneva from 26 June to 
1 July 2000, respectively, 

 Recalling also its resolution 61/156 of 19 December 2006, 

 Recalling further Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/17 of 
14 April 2005 on globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of all human 
rights,7  

 Recognizing that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent 
and interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights 
globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same 
emphasis, 

 Realizing that globalization affects all countries differently and makes them 
more exposed to external developments, positive as well as negative, inter alia, in 
the field of human rights, 

 Realizing also that globalization is not merely an economic process, but that it 
also has social, political, environmental, cultural and legal dimensions, which have 
an impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights, 

 Reaffirming the commitment contained in paragraphs 19 and 47 of the 
2005 World Summit Outcome8 to promote fair globalization and the development of 
the productive sectors in developing countries to enable them to participate more 
effectively in and benefit from the process of globalization, 

 Realizing the need to undertake a thorough, independent and comprehensive 
assessment of the social, environmental and cultural impact of globalization on 
societies, 

 Recognizing in each culture a dignity and value that deserve recognition, 
respect and preservation, convinced that, in their rich variety and diversity and in 
the reciprocal influences that they exert on one another, all cultures form part of the 
common heritage belonging to all humankind, and aware that the risk of a global 
monoculture poses more of a threat if the developing world remains poor and 
marginalized, 

 Recognizing also that multilateral mechanisms have a unique role to play in 
meeting the challenges and opportunities presented by globalization, 

 Emphasizing the global character of the migratory phenomenon, the 
importance of international, regional and bilateral cooperation and the need to

protect the human rights of migrants, particularly at a time in which migration flows 
have increased in the globalized economy, 

 Expressing concern at the negative impact of international financial turbulence 
on social and economic development and on the full enjoyment of all human rights, 

 Recognizing that globalization should be guided by the fundamental principles 
that underpin the corpus of human rights, such as equity, participation, 
accountability, non-discrimination at both the national and the international levels, 
respect for diversity, tolerance and international cooperation and solidarity, 

 Emphasizing that the existence of widespread extreme poverty inhibits the full 
and effective enjoyment of human rights; its immediate alleviation and eventual 
elimination must remain a high priority for the international community, 

 Strongly reiterating the determination to ensure the timely and full realization 
of the development goals and objectives agreed at the major United Nations 
conferences and summits, including those agreed at the Millennium Summit that are 
described as the Millennium Development Goals, which have helped to galvanize 
efforts towards poverty eradication, 

 Deeply concerned at the inadequacy of measures to narrow the widening gap 
between the developed and the developing countries, and within countries, which 
has contributed, inter alia, to deepening poverty and has adversely affected the full 
enjoyment of all human rights, in particular in developing countries, 

 Noting that human beings strive for a world that is respectful of human rights 
and cultural diversity and that, in this regard, they work to ensure that all activities, 
including those affected by globalization, are consistent with those aims, 

 1. Recognizes that, while globalization, by its impact on, inter alia, the role 
of the State, may affect human rights, the promotion and protection of all human 
rights is first and foremost the responsibility of the State; 

 2. Emphasizes that development should be at the centre of the international 
economic agenda and that coherence between national development strategies and 
international obligations and commitments is imperative for an enabling 
environment for development and an inclusive and equitable globalization; 

 3. Reaffirms that narrowing the gap between rich and poor, both within and 
between countries, is an explicit goal at the national and international levels, as part 
of the effort to create an enabling environment for the full enjoyment of all human 
rights; 

 4. Also reaffirms the commitment to create an environment at both the 
national and the global levels that is conducive to development and to the 
elimination of poverty through, inter alia, good governance within each country and 
at the international level, transparency in the financial, monetary and trading 
systems and commitment to an open, equitable, rule-based, predictable and 
non-discriminatory multilateral trading and financial system; 

 5. Recognizes that, while globalization offers great opportunities, the fact 
that its benefits are very unevenly shared and its costs unevenly distributed 
represents an aspect of the process that affects the full enjoyment of all human 
rights, in particular in developing countries; 



A/C.3/62/L.31  
 

07-57827 4 
 

 6. Welcomes the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights on globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of human 
rights,9 which focuses on the liberalization of agricultural trade and its impact on 
the realization of the right to development, including the right to food, and takes 
note of the conclusions and recommendations contained therein; 

 7. Calls upon Member States, relevant agencies of the United Nations 
system, intergovernmental organizations and civil society to promote equitable and 
environmentally sustainable economic growth for managing globalization so that 
poverty is systematically reduced and the international development targets are 
achieved; 

 8. Recognizes that only through broad and sustained efforts, including 
policies and measures at the global level to create a shared future based upon our 
common humanity in all its diversity, can globalization be made fully inclusive and 
equitable and have a human face, thus contributing to the full enjoyment of all 
human rights; 

 9. Underlines the urgent need to establish an equitable, transparent and 
democratic international system to strengthen and broaden the participation of 
developing countries in international economic decision-making and norm-setting; 

 10. Affirms that globalization is a complex process of structural 
transformation, with numerous interdisciplinary aspects, which has an impact on the 
enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right 
to development; 

 11. Also affirms that the international community should strive to respond to 
the challenges and opportunities posed by globalization in a manner that ensures 
respect for the cultural diversity of all; 

 12. Underlines, therefore, the need to continue to analyse the consequences 
of globalization for the full enjoyment of all human rights; 

 13. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General,10 and requests him to 
seek further the views of Member States and relevant agencies of the United Nations 
system and to submit a substantive report on the subject to the General Assembly at 
its sixty-third session.
