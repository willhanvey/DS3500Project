core final status issues, without exception, leading to a peaceful, just, lasting and 

comprehensive solution for the question of Palestine,  

 Recognizing that the occupation and ensuing persistent and systematic 

violations of international law by Israel, including international humanitarian and 

human rights law, are considered to be the main sources of other Israeli violations 

and discriminatory policies against the Palestinian civilian population in the 

Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem,  

 Gravely concerned about the continuing detrimental impact of ongoing 

unlawful Israeli practices and measures in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,

civilians and the widespread destruction of property and vital infrastructure,

2014, as well as ongoing settlement activities and construction of the wall, the

including their right to self-determination and their independent State,
