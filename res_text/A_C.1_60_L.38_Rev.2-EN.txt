The General Assembly,

Recalling its various resolutions in the field of nuclear disarmament, including
its most recent resolutions 59/77, 59/83 and 59/102 of 3 December 2004,

Bearing in mind its resolution 2373 (XXII) of 12 June 1968, the annex to

Noting the provisions of article VIII, paragraph 3, of the Treaty regarding the
convening of review conferences at five-year intervals,

Recalling its resolution 50/70 Q of 12 December 1995 in which the General
Assembly noted that the States parties to the Treaty affirmed the need to continue to
move with determination towards the full realization and effective implementation
of the provisions of the Treaty, and accordingly adopted a set of principles and
objectives,

Recalling also that on 11 May 1995, the Review and Extension Conference of
the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons2 adopted
three decisions on strengthening the review process for the Treaty, principles and
objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, and extension of the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,

Reaffirming the resolution on the Middle East adopted on 11 May 1995 by the

Reaffirming also its resolution 55/33 D of 20 November 2000, in which the
General Assembly welcomed the adoption by consensus on 19 May 2000 of the
Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,3 including, in particular the documents
entitled “Review of the operation of the Treaty, taking into account the decisions
and the resolution adopted by the 1995 Review and Extension Conference” and
“Improving the effectiveness of the strengthened review process for the Treaty”,4

Taking into consideration the unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon
States, in the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to accomplish the total
elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament, to which all
States parties to the Treaty are committed under article VI of the Treaty,

Gravely concerned over the failure of the 2005 Review Conference of the
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to reach any
substantive agreement on the follow-up of the nuclear disarmament obligations,

1. Determines to pursue practical steps for systematic and progressive
efforts to implement article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons1 and paragraphs 3 and 4 (c) of the decision on principles and objectives for
nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament of the 1995 Review and Extension
Conference of the Parties to the Treaty;2

2. Calls for practical steps, as agreed by the 2000 Review Conference of the
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to be taken by
all nuclear-weapon States that would lead to nuclear disarmament in a way that
promotes international stability and, based upon the principle of undiminished
security for all, for:

(a) Further efforts to be made by the nuclear-weapon States to reduce their
nuclear arsenals unilaterally;

(b) Increased transparency by the nuclear-weapon States with regard to
nuclear weapons capabilities and the implementation of agreements pursuant to
article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and as a
voluntary confidence-building measure to support further progress in nuclear
disarmament;

(c) The further reduction of non-strategic nuclear weapons, based on
unilateral initiatives and as an integral part of the nuclear arms reduction and
disarmament process;

(d) Concrete agreed measures to reduce further the operational status of
nuclear weapons systems;

(e) A diminishing role for nuclear weapons in security policies so as to
minimize the risk that these weapons will ever be used and to facilitate the process
of their total elimination;

(f) The engagement, as soon as appropriate, of all the nuclear-weapon States
in the process leading to the total elimination of their nuclear weapons;

3. Notes that the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons agreed that legally binding security
assurances by the five nuclear-weapon States to the non-nuclear-weapon States
parties to the Treaty strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime;

4. Urges the States Parties to the Treaty to follow up on the implementation
of the nuclear disarmament obligations under the Treaty and agreed to at the 1995
Review and Extension Conference and the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties
to the Treaty within the framework of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to
the Treaty and its preparatory committees;

5. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-second session
the item entitled “Follow-up to nuclear disarmament obligations agreed in the 1995
and 2000 Review Conferences of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons”.
