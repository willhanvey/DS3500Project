ANNEX

n  cs rason o f  existina

1. Without prejudice to Article 18 of the Charter of the United Nations and
with a view to facilitating the work of the United Nations, including, whenever
possible, the adoption by the General Assembly of agreed texts of resolutions and
decisions, informal consultations should be carried out with the widest possible
participation of Member States.

2, When an electronic voting system is available for recording how votes
were  cast , a roll-call vote should as far as possible not be requested.

3. Before the end of each session of the General Assembly, the General
Committee should, in the light of the experience it has acquired during that
session, consider drawing up its observations on the organiaation of the work ot
the session, with a view to facilitating the organisation of the work of future
sessions of the General Assembly.

4 . The agenda of the General Assembly should be simplified by grouping or
merging, to the extent possible, related items and, where it is appropriate for
discussion of a particular item, by setting an interval of more than a year between
the discussions on it. For this purpose, the Chairman of the Main Committee
concerned 07, as appropriate, the President of the General Assembly, should
undertake consultations with delegations.

5. The General Committee should consider, at the beginning of each session
of the General Assembly, recommending that certain Main Committees should meet in
sequential order, taking into account such matters as the number of meetings
required for the consideration ot the questions with which they are charged at that
session, the organisation  of the work of the whole session and the problem of
participation of smaller delegations.

6 . In making recommendaticns  as to how agenda items should be allocated to
the Main Committees and the plenary of the General Assembly,  the General  Committee
should ensure the best use of the expertise of the Committees.

7. When the General. Assembly considers whether it needs to establish
subsidiary organs, in accordance with Article 22 of the Charter, it sr~oulcl  give
careful consideration as to whether the subject--matter in question could be dealt
with by existing organs, iwluding its Main Cc.rur,ittees  and their working groups,
::klbsidiary Of(JanS should seek constantly to inprove their procedures and methods of
work in order to ensure effective consideration of questions allocated to them by
the Assembly.

8. The dates and length of the sessions of bodies of the General Assembly
that meet inter-sessionally should be determined as soon as possible by the
Assembly, as appropriate, following advice from the Committee on Conferences, on
the proposal of the Secretary-General. The Assembly should take account of the
past experience, the state of current work in regard to the mandate given to the
body in question and the need to avoid as far as possible overlapping meetings of
bodles that deal with subject-matter of a similar nature.

9. Informal consultations about the work of bodies of the General Assembly
that meet inter-sessionally  should continue to be held in advance of the sessions
of such bodies in order to facilitate the conduct of their sessions, especially as
regards the composition of the bureau and the organisation of work.

10. Resolutions should request observations from States or reports by the
Secretary-General in so far as they are likely to facilitate the implementation of
the resolutions or the continued examination of the question.
