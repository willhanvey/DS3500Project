 Noting that, as a small island Territory, Tokelau exemplifies the situation of 
most remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories and that, as a case study pointing to 
successful cooperation for decolonization, Tokelau has wider significance for the 
United Nations as it seeks to complete its work in decolonization, 

 Recalling that New Zealand and Tokelau signed in November 2003 a 
document entitled “Joint statement of the principles of partnership”, which sets out 
the rights and responsibilities of the two partners, 

 Bearing in mind the decision of the General Fono at its meeting in November 
2003, following extensive consultations undertaken in all three villages, to explore 
formally with New Zealand the option of self-government in free association and its 
decision in August 2005 to hold in February 2006 a referendum on self-
determination on the basis of a draft constitution for Tokelau and a draft treaty of 
free association with New Zealand, and its subsequent decision to hold a further 
referendum in October 2007, 

 1. Notes that Tokelau and New Zealand remain firmly committed to the 
ongoing development of Tokelau for the long-term benefit of the people of Tokelau, 
with particular emphasis on the further development of facilities on each atoll that 
meet their current requirements; 

 2. Welcomes the progress made towards the devolution of power to the three 
taupulega (village councils), in particular the delegation of the Administrator’s 
powers to the three taupulega with effect from 1 July 2004 and the assumption by

each taupulega from that date of full responsibility for the management of all its 
public services;  

 3. Recalls the decision of the General Fono in November 2003, following 
extensive consultations in all three villages and a meeting of the Special Committee 
on the Constitution of Tokelau, to explore formally with New Zealand the option of 
self-government in free association, and the discussions subsequently held between 
Tokelau and New Zealand pursuant to the decision of the General Fono; 

 4. Also recalls the decision of the General Fono in August 2005 to hold a 
referendum on self-government on the basis of a draft constitution for Tokelau and a 
draft treaty of free association with New Zealand, and notes the enactment by the 
General Fono of rules for the referendum; 

 5. Further recalls that two referendums to determine the status of Tokelau, 
held in February 2006 and October 2007, did not produce the two-thirds majority of 
the valid votes cast required by the General Fono to change Tokelau’s status from 
that of a Non-Self-Governing Territory under the administration of New Zealand; 

 6. Commends the professional and transparent conduct of both the February 
2006 and the October 2007 referendums, monitored by the United Nations; 

 7. Acknowledges the decision of the General Fono that consideration of any 
future act of self-determination by Tokelau will be deferred and that New Zealand 
and Tokelau will devote renewed effort and attention to ensuring that essential 
services and infrastructure on the atolls of Tokelau are enhanced and strengthened, 
thereby ensuring an enhanced quality of life for the people of Tokelau; 

 8. Also acknowledges Tokelau’s adoption of its National Strategic Plan for 
2010-2015; 

 9. Further acknowledges the ongoing and consistent commitment of New 
Zealand to meeting the social and economic requirements of the people of Tokelau, 
as well as the support and cooperation of the United Nations Development 
Programme; 

 10. Acknowledges Tokelau’s need for continued support from the 
international community; 

 11. Recalls with satisfaction the establishment and operation of the Tokelau 
International Trust Fund to support the ongoing needs of Tokelau, and calls upon 
Member States and international and regional agencies to contribute to the Fund and 
thereby lend practical support to Tokelau in overcoming the problems of smallness, 
isolation and lack of resources; 

 12. Welcomes the cooperative attitude of the other States and territories in the 
region towards Tokelau, and their support for its economic and political aspirations 
and its increasing participation in regional and international affairs; 

 13. Calls upon the administering Power and United Nations agencies to 
continue to provide assistance to Tokelau as it further develops; 

 14. Welcomes the actions taken by the administering Power to transmit 
information regarding the political, economic and social situation of Tokelau to the 
Secretary-General; 



A/65/430

 15. Also welcomes the commitment of both Tokelau and New Zealand to 
continue to work together in the interests of Tokelau and its people; 

 16. Requests the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the 
Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial 
Countries and Peoples to continue to examine the question of the Non-Self-
Governing Territory of Tokelau and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its 
sixty-sixth session.

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for 2010,1  

 Recalling all resolutions and decisions of the United Nations relating to those 
Territories, including, in particular, the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly 
at its sixty-fourth session on the individual Territories covered by the present 
resolutions, 

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territories 
are valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the 
peoples concerned and in conformity with the clearly defined principles contained 
in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of 
15 December 1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 1541 (XV), containing the principles that should guide 
Member States in determining whether or not an obligation exists to transmit the 
information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter of the United Nations, 

 Expressing concern that fifty years after the adoption of the Declaration on the 
Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples,2 there still remain a 
number of Non-Self-Governing Territories, 

 Conscious of the importance of continuing effective implementation of the 
Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 
colonialism by 2010 and the plan of action for the Second International Decade for 
the Eradication of Colonialism,3  

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the peoples 
of the Territories require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the options 
for self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical

United States of America on the Non-Self-Governing Territories under their 
administration, 

 Noting also the constitutional developments in some Non-Self-Governing 
Territories affecting the internal structure of governance about which the Special 
Committee has received information, 

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories 
should continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 
referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 
important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people, 

 Convinced also that any negotiations to determine the status of a Territory 
must take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of that 
Territory, under the aegis of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that 
the views of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories in respect of their 
right to self-determination should be ascertained, 

 Noting that a number of Non-Self-Governing Territories have expressed 
concern at the procedure followed by some administering Powers, contrary to the 
wishes of the Territories themselves, of amending or enacting legislation for 
application to the Territories, either through orders in council, in order to apply to 
the Territories the international treaty obligations of the administering Power, or 
through the unilateral application of laws and regulations, 

 Aware of the importance of the international financial services and tourism 
sectors for the economies of some of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, 

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the

organizations, 

 Mindful that United Nations visiting and special missions provide an effective 
means of ascertaining the situation in the Territories, that some Territories have not 
received a United Nations visiting mission for a long time and that no visiting 
missions have been sent to some of the Territories, and considering the possibility of 
sending further visiting missions to the Territories at an appropriate time, in 
consultation with the relevant administering Powers and in accordance with the 
relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations on decolonization, 

 Mindful also that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its 
understanding of the political status of the peoples of the Territories and to fulfil its 
mandate effectively, it is important for it to be apprised by the relevant 
administering Powers and to receive information from other appropriate sources, 
including the representatives of the Territories, concerning the wishes and 
aspirations of the peoples of the Territories, 

 Acknowledging the regular transmission by the administering Powers to the 
Secretary-General of information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter,

 Recognizing the need for the Special Committee to ensure that the appropriate 
bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at 
assisting the peoples of the Territories in gaining a better understanding of the 
options for self-determination, 

 Mindful, in this connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the 
Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 
representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 
the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate, and that the regional nature of the 
seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial 
element in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political 
status of the Territories, 

 Noting the stated positions of the representatives of the Non-Self-Governing 
Territories before the Special Committee and at its regional seminars, 

 Mindful that the 2010 Pacific regional seminar was held in Nouméa from 18 to 
20 May 2010,

and environmental degradation, and, in this connection, bearing in mind the 
applicability to the Territories of the programmes of action or outcome documents 
of all United Nations world conferences and special sessions of the General 
Assembly in the economic and social spheres, 

 Noting with appreciation the contribution to the development of some 
Territories by the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations 
system, in particular the United Nations Development Programme, the Economic 
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and the Economic and Social 
Commission for Asia and the Pacific, as well as regional institutions such as the 
Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean Community, the Organization of 
Eastern Caribbean States, the Pacific Islands Forum and the agencies of the Council 
of Regional Organizations in the Pacific, 

 Aware that the Human Rights Committee, as part of its mandate under the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,4 reviews the status of the 
self-determination process, including in small island Territories under examination 
by the Special Committee, 

 Recalling the ongoing efforts of the Special Committee in carrying out a 
critical review of its work with the aim of making appropriate and constructive 
recommendations and decisions to attain its objectives in accordance with its 
mandate, 

 Recognizing that the annual working papers prepared by the Secretariat on 
developments in each of the small Territories,5 as well as the substantive 
documentation and information furnished by experts, scholars, non-governmental 
organizations and other sources, have provided important inputs to update the 
present resolutions,
