America had breached the obligation incumbent upon it under the Order indicating 

provisional measures of 16 July 2008,4 in the case of Mr. José Ernesto Medellín Rojas,  

 Having considered that, to date, neither revision nor reconsideration has been 

granted to the Mexican nationals included in the Judgment of 31 March 2004,

constituting new breaches of the international obligations incumbent upon the United 

States of America and causing additional harm to Mexico,

International Court of Justice of 31 March 2004 in the case concerning Avena and 

Other Mexican Nationals1 in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Charter 

of the United Nations;  

 2. Requests the Secretary-General to use his good offices towards the 

implementation of the present resolution.
