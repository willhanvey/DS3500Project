important role the United Nations plays in leading and coordinating this effort,  

 Recognizing that development, security, and human rights are mutually

groups and to secure the safe release of hostages without ransom payments or political 

concessions, in accordance with applicable international law, reiterating its call upon

in September 2015 of the “Addendum to the Algiers Memorandum on Good Practices 

on Preventing and Denying the Benefits of Kidnapping for Ransom by Terrorists” and 

urging all States to remain vigilant about kidnapping and hostage-taking by ISIL, 

Al-Qaida, and their affiliates,  

 Gravely concerned that in some cases ISIL, Al-Qaida, and associated 

individuals, groups, undertakings, and entities continue to profit from involvement in 

transnational organized crime, and expressing concern that terrorists benefit from 

transnational organized crime in some regions, including from the trafficking of arms, 

persons, drugs, and artefacts, and from the illicit trade in natural resources including 

gold and other precious metals and stones, minerals, wildlife, charcoal, petroleum, 

and petroleum products, as well as from kidnapping for ransom and other crimes 

including extortion and bank robbery,  

 Recognizing the need to take measures to prevent and suppress the financing of 

terrorism, terrorist organizations, and individual terrorists even in the absence of a 

link to a specific terrorist act, including from the proceeds of organized crime, inter 

alia, the illicit production and trafficking of drugs and their chemical precursors, and 

recalling paragraph 5 of resolution 1452 (2002),  

 Reiterating the central role of the United Nations, in particular its Security 

Council, in preventing and combatting terrorism and stressing the essential role of the 

Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in setting global standards for preventing and 

combatting money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing and its 

Global Network of FATF-style regional bodies (FSRBs),

including small arms and light weapons, to terrorists, as well as its calls on States to 

find ways of intensifying and accelerating the exchange of operational information 

regarding trafficking in arms, and to enhance coordination of efforts on national, 

subregional, regional, and international levels,  

 Strongly condemning the continued flow of weapons, including small arms and 

light weapons, unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) and their components, improvised 

explosive device (IED) components, and military equipment including Man-Portable

groups, illegal armed groups and criminals, and encouraging Member States to 

prevent and disrupt procurement networks for such weapons, systems and 

components between ISIL, Al-Qaida and associated individuals, groups, undertakings 

and entities, including through proposing relevant listing requests,  

 Expressing concern at the increased use, in a globalized society, by terrorists 

and their supporters of new information and communications technologies, in 

particular the Internet, to facilitate terrorist acts, as well as their use to incite, recruit, 

fund, or plan terrorist acts,  

 Stressing the need to effectively counter the ways that ISIL, Al-Qaida and 

associated individuals, groups, undertakings and entities use their narratives to incite 

and recruit others to commit terrorist acts, and further recalling in this regard 

resolution 2354 (2017) and the “Comprehensive International Framework to Counter 

Terrorist Narratives” (S/2017/375) with recommended guidelines and good practices,

associated groups and the scale of this phenomenon, and recalling its resolution 2178 

(2014) deciding that Member States shall, consistent with international human rights 

law, international refugee law, and international humanitarian law, prevent and 

suppress the recruiting, organizing, transporting, or equipping of foreign terrorist 

fighters and the financing or facilitation of their travel and of their activities,  

 Reiterating the obligation of Member States to prevent the entry into or transit 

through their territories of any individual about whom that State has credible 

information that provides reasonable grounds to believe that he or she is seeking entry 

into or transit through their territory for the purpose of participating in the foreign 

terrorist fighter-related activities described in paragraph 6 of resolution 2178 (2014), 

and reiterating further the obligation of Member States to prevent the movement of 

terrorist groups, in accordance with applicable international law, by, inter alia, 

effective border controls, and, in this context, to exchange information expeditiously, 

improve cooperation among competent authorities to prevent the movement of 

terrorists and terrorist groups to and from their territories, the supply of weapons for 

terrorists, and financing that would support terrorists,  

 Expressing concern at the increasing number of foreign terrorist fighters leaving 

zones of armed conflict, returning to their countries of origin, transiting through, 

traveling to or relocating to or from other Member States, and encouraging Member 

States to share relevant information, as appropriate, within and between governments 

about funding flows and movement of foreign terrorist fighters to mitigate the risk 

they pose,  

 Calling upon Member States to continue information sharing, through 

appropriate channels and arrangements, and consistent with international and 

domestic law, on individuals, groups, undertakings and entities implicated in terrorist 

activities, in particular their supply of weapons and sources of material support, and 

on the ongoing international counter-terrorism coordination including among special 

services, security agencies and law enforcement organizations and criminal justice 

authorities,  

 Condemning any engagement in direct or indirect trade, in particular of 

petroleum and petroleum products, modular refineries, and related materiel including 

chemicals and lubricants, with ISIL, Al-Nusrah Front (ANF), and associated 

individuals, groups, undertakings, and entities designated by the Committee, and 

reiterating that such engagement would constitute support for such individuals, 

groups, undertakings, and entities and may lead to further listings by the Committee,  

 Condemning the destruction of cultural heritage, particularly in Iraq and Syria 

by ISIL, Al-Qaida, and ANF, including targeted destruction of religious sites and 

objects; and recalling its decision that all Member States shall take appropriate steps 

to prevent the trade in Iraqi and Syrian cultural property and other items of 

archaeological, historical, cultural, rare scientific, and religious importance illegally 

removed from Iraq since 6 August 1990 and from Syria since 15 March 2011, 

including by prohibiting cross-border trade in such items, thereby allowing for their 

eventual safe return to the Iraqi and Syrian people,  

 Recalling its resolution 2396 (2017) expressing concern with the continued 

threat posed to international peace and security by ISIL, Al-Qaida, and associated 

individuals, groups, undertakings, and entities, and reaffirming its resolve to address

 Condemning in the strongest terms abductions of women and children by ISIL, 

Al-Qaida, ANF and associated individuals, groups, undertakings, and entities and 

recalling resolution 2242 (2015), expressing outrage at their exploitation and abuse, 

including rape, sexual violence, forced marriage, and enslavement by these entities, 

encouraging all State and non-state actors with evidence to bring it to the attention of 

the Council, along with any information that such human trafficking and related forms 

of exploitation and abuse may support the perpetrators financially, emphasizing that 

this resolution requires States to ensure that their nationals and persons within their 

territory do not make available any funds, financial assets or economic resources for 

ISIL’s benefit, and noting that any person or entity who transfers funds to ISIL directly 

or indirectly in connection with such exploitation and abuse would be eligible for 

listing by the Committee,  

 Recalling its resolution 2331 (2016), condemning all acts of trafficking, further 

expressing its intention to invite the Special Representatives of the Secretary-General 

on Sexual Violence in Conflict and on Children and Armed Conflict to brief the

relevant information including, if applicable, the names of individuals involved in the 

trafficking in persons who may meet the Committee’s designation criteria,

restrictions on assets and travel in paragraphs 1 (a) and (b) of this resolution for the 

sole purpose of allowing the petitioner to meet travel expenses and travel to another 

State to be interviewed by the Ombudsperson for a period no longer than necessary

15. In cases where the Ombudsperson recommends retaining the listing, the 

requirement for States to take the measures in paragraph 1 of this resolution shall 

remain in place with respect to that individual, group, undertaking or entity, unless a 

Committee member submits a delisting request, which the Committee shall consider 

under its normal consensus procedures.  

16. In cases where the Ombudsperson recommends that the Committee consider 

delisting, the requirement for States to take the measures described in paragraph 1 of 

this resolution shall terminate with respect to that individual, group, undertaking or 

entity 60 days after the Committee completes consideration of a Comprehensive 

Report of the Ombudsperson, in accordance with this annex II, including paragraph 

7 (h), unless the Committee decides by consensus before the end of that 60-day period 

that the requirement shall remain in place with respect to that individual, group, 

undertaking or entity; provided that, in cases where consensus does not exist, the 

Chair shall, on the request of a Committee Member, submit the question of whether

recommendation, the Ombudsperson immediately informs the Petitioner of the 

Committee’s decision and submits to the Committee, for its review, a  summary of the 

analysis contained in the Comprehensive Report. The Committee reviews the 

summary within 30 days of the decision to retain or terminate the listing, and 

communicates its views on the summary to the Ombudsperson. The purpose of the 

Committee’s review is to address any security concerns, including to review if any 

information confidential to the Committee is inadvertently included in the summary. 

Following the Committee’s review, the Ombudsperson transmits the summary to the 

Petitioner. The summary shall accurately describe the principal reasons for the 

recommendation of the Ombudsperson, as reflected in the analysis of the 

Ombudsperson. In his or her communication with the Petitioner, the Ombudsperson 

will specify that the summary of the analysis does not reflect the views of the 

Committee or of any of its members. In cases where the listing is retained, the 

summary of the analysis shall cover all the arguments for delisting by the Petitioner 

to which the Ombudsperson responded. In cases of delisting, the summary shall 

include the key points of the analysis of the Ombudsperson. In cases where the 

Committee informs the Ombudsperson that it has not followed his or her 

recommendation or that the Chair has submitted the question to the Security Council 

under paragraph 16 of this Annex, the Committee communicates to the 

Ombudsperson, within 30 days of its decision or the Council’s decision, the reasons 

for this decision for transmission to the Petitioner. These reasons shall respond to the 

principal arguments of the Petitioner.
