revitalize a global partnership for development, for the realization of the right to 

development and the elimination of obstacles to development and that lasting 

progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective 

development policies at the national level, as well as equitable economic relations 

and a favourable economic environment at the international level,  

 Recognizing further that poverty is an affront to human dignity,  

 Recognizing that extreme poverty and hunger are among the greatest global 

threats and require the collective commitment of the international community for 

their eradication, pursuant to Millennium Development Goal 1 and Sustainable 

Development Goals 1 and 2, and therefore calling upon the international community , 

including the Human Rights Council, to contribute towards achieving that goal,  

 Recognizing also that historical injustices, inter alia, have contributed to the 

poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion, economic disparity, 

instability and insecurity that affect many people in different parts of the world, in 

particular in developing countries,  

 Recognizing further that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, 

including extreme poverty, is one of the critical elements in the promotion and 

realization of the right to development and is the greatest global challenge and an 

indispensable requirement for sustainable development, which requires a 

multifaceted and integrated approach, and committed to achieving sustainable 

development in its three dimensions — economic, social and environmental — in a 

balanced and integrated manner,

respective mandates, including the specialized agencies, funds and programmes of 

the United Nations system, relevant international organizations, including the World 

Trade Organization, and relevant stakeholders, including civil society organizations, 

to give due consideration to the right to development in the implementation of the 

2030 Agenda and to cooperate with the United Nations High Commissioner for 

Human Rights in the fulfilment of his mandate with regard to the implementation of 

the right to development,

and reiterated its unequivocal commitment to the right to development, recognized 

the high profile that it deserves and redoubled its efforts to implement that right;  

 4. Acknowledges other events held in 2016 to commemorate the thirtieth 

anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to Development, including the 

convening, during the thirty-first session of the Human Rights Council, of the 

annual high-level panel discussion on human rights mainstreaming, on the theme 

“The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and human rights, with an 

emphasis on the right to development”, and the panel discussion on the promotion 

and protection of the right to development, during the thirty -second session of the 

Council; 

 5. Also acknowledges the need to strive for greater acceptance, 

operationalization and realization of the right to development at the international 

level while urging all States to undertake at the national level the necessary policy 

formulation and to institute the measures required for the implementation of the 

right to development as an integral part of all human rights and fundamental 

freedoms; 

 6. Supports the realization of the mandate of the Working Group on the 

Right to Development, as renewed by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 9/3 

of 24 September 2008,
15

 and recognizes the need for renewed efforts towards 

intensifying deliberations in the Working Group to fulfil its mandate at the earliest;  

 7. Reaffirms the recommendations adopted by the Working Group at its

calls upon the Council to implement the agreement to continue to act to ensure that 

its agenda promotes and advances sustainable development, including the 2030 

Agenda for Sustainable Development,
5
 which seeks to build on the Millennium 

Development Goals and complete what they did not achieve, and also in this regard 

to lead the raising of the right to development, as set out in paragraphs 5 and 10 of 

the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action,
3
 to the same level as and on a par 

with all other human rights and fundamental freedoms;  

 9. Stresses that the views, criteria and corresponding operational subcriteria,  

once considered, revised and endorsed by the Working Group, should be used, as

appropriate, in the elaboration of a comprehensive and coherent set of standards for 

the implementation of the right to development;  

 10. Emphasizes the importance of the Working Group taking appropriate 

steps to ensure respect for and the practical application of the above-mentioned 

standards, which could take various forms, including the elaboration of guidelines 

on the implementation of the right to development, and evolve into a basis for the 

consideration of an international legal standard of a binding nature through a 

collaborative process of engagement;  

 11. Acknowledges the commencement of the work on the standards for the 

implementation of the right to development based on relevant United Nations 

resolutions and documents, including the Declaration on the Right to Development, 

relevant international conventions and decisions as well as internationally agreed 

development goals and United Nations resolutions, in consultation with Member 

States, relevant international organizations and other stakeholders; 

 12. Recalls that the report of the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 

standards for the implementation of the right to development
17

 was prepared without 

prejudice to the ongoing discussions on the criteria and operational subcrite ria, in 

the context of which the Working Group completed its second reading at its 

seventeenth session and decided on further action, with the objective of elaborating 

a comprehensive and coherent set of standards for the implementation of the right to 

development; 

 13. Stresses the importance of the core principles contained in the conclusions  

of the Working Group at its third session
18

 that are congruent with the purpose of 

international human rights instruments, such as equality, non-discrimination, 

accountability, participation and international cooperation, as critical to mainstreaming  

the right to development at the national and international levels, and underlines the 

importance of the principles of equity and transparency;  

 14. Also stresses that it is important that the Chair-Rapporteur and the 

Working Group, in the discharge of their mandates, take into account the need:  

 (a) To promote the democratization of the system of international governance  

in order to increase the effective participation of developing countries in international 

decision-making; 

 (b) To also promote effective partnerships such as the New Partnership for 

Africa’s Development

particularly the least developed countries, for the purpose of the realization of their 

right to development, including the achievement of the Sustainable Development 

Goals;

and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation in ensuring development and eliminating  

obstacles to development in the context of promoting effective international 

cooperation for the realization of the right to development, bearing in mind that 

lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires 

effective development policies at the national level and a favourable economic 

environment at the international level;  

 (d) To consider ways and means to continue to ensure the operationalization 

of the right to development as a priority;  

 (e) To mainstream the right to development in the policies and operational 

activities of the specialized agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations 

system, as well as in the policies and strategies of the international financial and 

multilateral trading systems, bearing in mind in this regard that the core principles 

of the international economic, commercial and financial spheres, such as equity, 

non-discrimination, transparency, accountability, participation and international 

cooperation, including effective partnerships for development, are indispensable in 

achieving the right to development and preventing discriminatory treatment arising 

from political or other non-economic considerations in addressing the issues of 

concern to the developing countries;  

 15. Encourages the Human Rights Council to continue to consider how to 

ensure follow-up to the work of the former Subcommission on the Promotion and 

Protection of Human Rights on the right to development, in accordance with the 

relevant provisions of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the 

Commission on Human Rights and in compliance with decisions to be taken by the 

Council; 

 16. Welcomes the decision of the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 

33/14 of 29 September 2016,
19

 to appoint, for a period of three years, a Special 

Rapporteur on the right to development, whose mandate should add value to the 

work of the Working Group, while avoiding any duplication, and urges Member 

States, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and  

other relevant specialized agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations 

system to provide the Special Rapporteur with all the assistance and support 

necessary for the fulfilment of his or her mandate;  

 17. Reaffirms the commitment to implement the goals and targets set out in 

all the outcome documents of the major United Nations conferences and summits 

and their review processes, in particular those relating to the realization of the right 

to development, recognizing that the realization of the right to development is 

critical to achieving the objectives, goals and targets set in those outcome 

documents; 

 18. Also reaffirms that the realization of the right to development is essential 

to the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which 

regards all human rights as universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, 

places the human person at the centre of development and recognizes that, while 

development facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights, a lack of development

may not be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally recognized human 

rights; 

 19. Stresses that the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection 

of all human rights lies with the State, and reaffirms that States have the primary  

responsibility for their own economic and social development and that the role of 

national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized;  

 20. Reaffirms the primary responsibility of States to create national and 

international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to development, as 

well as their commitment to cooperate with one another to that end;  

 21. Expresses concern about the increasing cases of human rights violations 

and abuses by some transnational corporations and other business enterprises, 

underlines the need to ensure that appropriate protection, justice and remedies are 

provided to the victims of human rights violations and abuses resulting from their 

activities, and underscores the fact that these entities must contribute to the means 

of implementation for the realization of the right to development;  

 22. Reaffirms the need for an international environment that is conducive to 

the realization of the right to development;  

 23. Emphasizes the critical importance of identifying and analysing obstacles 

impeding the full realization of the right to development at both the national and 

international levels; 

 24. Affirms that, while globalization offers both opportunities and challenges, 

the process of globalization remains deficient in achieving the objectives of 

integrating all countries into a globalized world, stresses the need for policies and 

measures at the national and global levels to respond to the challenges and 

opportunities of globalization if this process is to be made fully inclusive and 

equitable, recognizes that globalization has brought disparities between and within 

countries and that issues such as trade and trade liberalization, the transfer of 

technology, infrastructure development and market access should be managed 

effectively in order to mitigate the challenges of poverty and underdevelopment and 

to make the right to development a reality for everyone;  

 25. Recognizes that, despite continuous efforts on the part of the international  

community, the gap between developed and developing countries remains 

unacceptably wide, that most of the developing countries continue to face difficulties 

in participating in the globalization process and that many risk being marginalized 

and effectively excluded from its benefits; 

 26. Expresses its deep concern, in this regard, about the negative impact on 

the realization of the right to development due to the further aggravation of the 

economic and social situation, in particular of developing countries, as a result o f 

the ongoing international energy, food and financial crises, as well as the increasing 

challenges posed by global climate change and the loss of biodiversity, which have 

increased vulnerabilities and inequalities and have adversely affected development 

gains, in particular in developing countries;  

 27. Encourages Member States to give particular consideration to the right to 

development in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development ;  



 
A/C.3/71/L.32/Rev.1 

 

9/11 16-20223 

 

 28. Recalls the commitment in the United Nations Millennium Declaration
4
 

of halving the number of people living in poverty by 2015, notes with concern that 

some developing countries have failed to achieve the Millennium Development 

Goals, and in this regard invites Member States and the international community to 

take proactive measures aimed at creating a conducive environment to contribute to 

the effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda, in particular increasing international 

cooperation, including partnership and commitment, between developed and developing 

countries towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals; 

 29. Urges developed countries that have not yet done so to make concrete 

efforts towards meeting the targets of 0.7 per cent of their gross natio nal product for 

official development assistance to developing countries and 0.15 to 0.2 per cent of 

their gross national product to the least developed countries, and encourages 

developing countries to build on the progress achieved in ensuring that offici al 

development assistance is used effectively to help to meet development goals and 

targets; 

 30. Recognizes the need to address market access for developing countries, 

including in the sectors of agriculture, services and non -agricultural products, in 

particular those of interest to developing countries;  

 31. Calls once again for the implementation of a desirable pace of 

meaningful trade liberalization, including in areas under negotiation in the World 

Trade Organization, the implementation of commitments on implementation-related 

issues and concerns, a review of special and differential treatment provisions, with a 

view to strengthening them and making them more precise, effective and 

operational, the avoidance of new forms of protectionism, and capacity -building and 

technical assistance for developing countries as important issues in making progress 

towards the effective implementation of the right to development;  

 32. Recognizes the important link between the international economic, 

commercial and financial spheres and the realization of the right to development, 

stresses in this regard the need for good governance and for broadening the base of 

decision-making at the international level on issues of development concern and the
