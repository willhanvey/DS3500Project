Draft resolution

The Security Council,

Reaffirming all its previous resolutions and statements pertaining to the
situation between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and the requirements contained therein,
including in particular resolution 1507 (2003) of 12 September 2003,

Reiterating its support for the peace process and its unwavering commitment,
including through the role played by the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and
Eritrea (UNMEE), to the full and expeditious implementation of the Comprehensive
Peace Agreement signed by the Governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea (hereinafter
referred to as “the parties”) on 12 December 2000 and the preceding Agreement on
the Cessation of Hostilities of 18 June 2000 (S/2000/1183 and S/2000/601,
respectively, hereinafter referred to as the “Algiers Agreements”), and the
delimitation decision by the Boundary Commission of 13 April 2002 (S/2002/423),
embraced by the parties as final and binding in accordance with the Algiers
Agreements,

Noting with concern the continuing impasse in the peace process, mainly due
to the lack of progress in the demarcation of the border,

Taking note with concern of the Twelfth report on the work of the Eritrea-
Ethiopia Boundary Commission of 27 February 2004, in particular its conclusion
that under the present circumstances the Commission is unable to progress with
demarcation activities,

Expressing its concern about Ethiopia’s rejection of significant parts of the
Boundary Commission’s decision, and its current lack of cooperation with the
Boundary Commission,

Expressing disappointment also about Eritrea’s refusal at present to engage
with the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Ethiopia and Eritrea,

Emphasizing that cooperation with the Special Envoy offers both parties a
concrete opportunity to move the peace process forward,

Recognizing the increasing demand for United Nations peacekeeping and
resources from the international community for peacekeeping and peace-building
purposes, and recalling the additional operational costs due to the delays in the
demarcation process,

S/2004/188

Expressing its support for the Special Representative of the Secretary-General
and for UNMEE,

Having considered the report of the Secretary-General (S/2004/180), and fully
supporting the observations made therein,

15 September 2004;

2. Strongly urges the parties once again to cooperate fully and expeditiously
with UNMEE in the implementation of its mandate, and to step up its efforts to
ensure the security of all UNMEE staff, and reiterates in the strongest terms its
demand that the parties allow UNMEE full freedom of movement and remove with
immediate effect and without preconditions any and all restrictions on, and
impediments to the work of, UNMEE and its staff in the discharge of their mandate;

3. Stresses that the primary responsibility for implementation of the Algiers
Agreements and the decision of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission lies with
both parties;

4. Calls on the parties to cooperate fully and promptly with the Boundary
Commission, and to create the necessary conditions for demarcation to proceed

of the Boundary Commission’s decision, the appointment by Ethiopia of field
liaison officers, and the payment of its dues to the Boundary Commission;

5. Reaffirms the crucial importance of a political dialogue between the two
countries for the completion of the peace process and the consolidation of progress
achieved so far, and urges both parties to normalize their relations, including
through confidence-building measures, and to refrain from any threat or use of force
against each other;

6. Reiterates its support for the initiative of the Secretary-General to
exercise his good offices by appointing a Special Envoy, in order to facilitate the
implementation of the Algiers Agreements, the decision of the Boundary
Commission, and the relevant resolutions and decisions of the Security Council, and
to encourage the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries,
and emphasizes that this appointment does not constitute an alternative mechanism;

7. Expresses its full support for the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for
Ethiopia and Eritrea, Lloyd Axworthy, stresses that the Special Envoy enjoys the
unanimous support of the witnesses to the Algiers Agreements, namely the United
Nations, the United States of America, Algeria, the African Union, and the
European Union, and urges both parties, in particular the government of Eritrea, to
engage constructively and without further delay with the Special Envoy;
