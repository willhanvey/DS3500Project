 Gravely concerned about the level of violence against civilians in situations of

 Emphasising with deep concern that ongoing armed conflicts have devastating 

impacts on civilians and civilian objects, including civilians engaged in duties related 

to the operation, maintenance or repair of civilian infrastructure that is critical to the 

delivery of essential services to the civilian population and their assets that are

health care, water, sanitation, energy, posing devastating consequences for the civilian 

population, and hindering an effective humanitarian response,  

 Recognizing the interconnectedness of certain essential services, as well as the 

vulnerabilities of objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population that 

can be damaged in situations of armed conflict,  

 Reiterating the call on all parties to armed conflict to comply with their 

obligations under international humanitarian law including regarding respecting and 

protecting civilians and taking constant care to spare civilian objects, including such 

objects critical to the delivery of essential services to the civilian population, 

refraining from attacking, destroying, removing or rendering useless objects that are 

indispensable to the survival of the civilian population and respecting and protecting 

humanitarian personnel and consignments used for humanitarian relief operations,  

 Further expressing concern about the misuse of objects indispensable to the 

survival of the civilian population in contravention of applicable international law, 

that may endanger civilians and their ability to access essential services in situations 

of armed conflict, 

 Recalling its deep concern at the military use of schools in contravention of 

applicable international law, recognising that such use may render schools legitimate 

targets of attack, thus endangering children’s and teachers’ safety as well as children’s 

education, 

 Noting with concern the threats posed to civilian infrastructure, including that 

which supports essential services to the civilian population, by the use of any means 

or methods of warfare in violation of international humanitarian law, and the 

potentially devastating humanitarian impact of such use in situations of armed 

conflict, 

 Noting that armed conflicts, violations of international humanitarian law and 

international human rights law, and destruction of or other damage to objects 

indispensable to the survival of the civilian population can reduce or deprive civilians 

of access to essential services in situations of armed conflicts, and can be drivers of 

or aggravate forced displacement, compound the spread of infectious diseases in these 

contexts and hamper an effective public health response,  

 Reiterating its commitment to pursue all possible avenues to prevent and end 

armed conflicts, including through addressing their underlying root causes in an 

inclusive, integrated and sustainable manner,  

 Reiterating the need to strengthen efforts to resolve armed conflict and build 

sustainable peace and convinced that the protection of civilians in armed conflict and 

the protection of objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population 

should be an important aspect in this regard,  

 Reiterating deep concern at the increasing number of civilians in ongoing armed 

conflict and related violence facing the threat of conflict -induced food insecurity and 

the threat of famine, 

 Noting that the humanitarian situation in many armed conflicts can also be 

compounded by economic crises, increasingly frequent and severe weather events, 

and natural disasters and has deteriorated as a result of the impacts of the COVID -19 

pandemic and, in this regard, reaffirming the need for combatting and sustainably 

recovering from the pandemic, 

 Recalling the obligations of all parties to armed conflicts under international 

law, including international human rights law, as applicable, and international 

humanitarian law including the prohibition of attacks directed against civilians and 



 
S/2021/402

in medical duties, their means of transport and equipment, hospitals, and other 

medical facilities,

humanitarian law related to protecting civilians and civilian objects, meeting the basic 

needs of the civilian population within their territory or under their control, and 

allowing and facilitating the rapid and unimpeded passage of impartial humanitarian 

relief to all those in need, 

 Stressing the particular impact that armed conflict has on women, children, 

including as refugees and internally displaced persons, and other civilians who may 

have specific vulnerabilities including persons with disabilities and older  persons, 

including through increased risk of violence and lack of access to essential services, 

and stressing the protection and assistance needs of all affected civilian populations,  

 Recalling its practice that mandates of UN peacekeeping and other relevant 

missions include, where appropriate and on a case-by-case basis, provisions regarding 

the protection of civilians, 

 Stressing the need to fight against impunity and the importance of ensuring 

accountability for serious violations of international law, including international 

humanitarian law and international human rights law,  

 Recognising the need to return as quickly as possible and in an inclusive and 

equitable manner provision of essential services, while building back better and 

providing more resilient essential services to the civilian population, in contributing 

to advancing the comprehensive approach to sustaining peace in countries in 

situations of armed conflict and post-conflict, and in this regard, welcoming relevant 

international and regional cooperation, 

 1. Strongly condemns attacks in situations of armed conflicts directed against 

civilians as such and other protected persons or civilian objects, as well as 

indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks, resulting in the deprivation of the civilian

 2. Demands that all parties to armed conflicts fully comply with their

objectives, prohibiting indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks, taking all feasible

in a number of armed conflict situations which is prohibited by international law and 

may constitute a war crime; 



S/2021/402 
 

 

21-05594 4/4 

 

 5. Strongly condemns the unlawful denial of humanitarian access and 

depriving civilians of objects indispensable to their survival in situations of armed

 6. Urges all parties to armed conflict to protect civilian infrastructure which 

is critical to the delivery of humanitarian aid including for the provision of essential 

services concerning vaccinations and related medical care and other essential services 

to the civilian population in armed conflict and to ensuring the proper functioning of 

food systems and markets in situations of armed conflict;  

 7. Reiterates its demand that all parties to armed conflict engage immediately 

in a durable humanitarian pause to facilitate safe, unhindered and sustained delivery 

of humanitarian assistance, provision of related services by impartial humanitarian 

actors, consistent with humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality 

and independence, and medical evacuations, in accordance with international law, 

including international humanitarian law and refugee law as applicable, as well as 

equitable, safe and unhindered delivery and distribution of COVID-19 vaccination in 

areas of armed conflict; 

 8. Reiterates the important role that capacity building in international

objects; 

 (b) Allowing and facilitating safe passage of equipment, transport and 

supplies necessary for the reparation, maintenance or operation of such objects;

international level, including among the United Nations and relevant international, 

regional and sub-regional organizations, including through technical assistance and 

capacity building, with a view to supporting those affected by armed conflict to 

reduce humanitarian needs, enhance long-term recovery, protect livelihoods, improve 

access to essential services, build resilience of conflict-affected populations, and
