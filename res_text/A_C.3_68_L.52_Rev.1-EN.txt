 Recalling Commission on Human Rights resolution 1993/51 of 9 March 19933 
and all its subsequent resolutions concerning regional arrangements for the 
promotion and protection of human rights, 

 Reaffirming that regional cooperation plays a fundamental role in promoting 
and protecting human rights and should reinforce universal human rights, as 
contained in international human rights instruments, and their protection, 

 Noting that the developments in the Middle East and North Africa have 
generated growing demand for the services of the Centre, and recognizing that the 
report of the Secretary-General4 indicates that the Centre will be unable to 
effectively meet these demands and fully discharge its mandate without the 
allocation of appropriate funding and adequate resources, 

 Mindful of the vastness and the diversity of the needs in the field of human 
rights within South-West Asia and the Arab region, and taking into account the need 
for more appropriate and sustainable funding of the Centre to fully realize its 
significant function and crucial role in the region, 

 1. Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the activities of the 
United Nations Human Rights Training and Documentation Centre for South-West 
Asia and the Arab Region;4 

 2. Notes with appreciation the successful assistance that the Centre has 
provided through human rights capacity-building activities, technical assistance 
programmes, training activities and regional consultations on the topics of United 
Nations human rights mechanisms, human trafficking, the media and human rights 
education; 

 3. Underlines the Centre’s role as a source for regional expertise and the 
need to meet an increasing number of requests for training and documentation, 
including in the Arabic language, which require additional resources and the 
reinforcement of its activities; 

 4. Notes that the current level of human and financial resources are limiting 
the Centre’s capacity to respond in a timely and sustainable manner to these 
increasing requests to provide continuous follow-up support to the countries of the 
region and to appropriately respond to their needs; 

 5. Encourages the continued engagement of the Centre to work with other 
United Nations regional offices to strengthen its work and to avoid duplication; 

 6. Reaffirms the request contained in paragraph 5 of its resolution 67/162, 
endorses the proposal of the Secretary-General to strengthen the Centre as proposed 
in the report of the Secretary-General, with the costs to be borne by the regular 
budget and extrabudgetary resources as recommended by the Secretary-General, in 
order to ensure the full implementation of the mandate of the Centre; 

 7. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its 
sixty-ninth session a report, in accordance with the existing rules and procedures, on 
the implementation of the present resolution.
