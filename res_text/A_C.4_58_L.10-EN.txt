A/C.4/58/L.10

Aware of the continuing needs of Palestine refugees throughout all the fields of
operation, namely in Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic and the Occupied
Palestinian Territory,

Expressing grave concern at the especially difficult situation of the Palestine
refugees under occupation, including with regard to their safety, well-being and
living conditions, and the continuous deterioration of those conditions during the
recent period,

Noting the signing of the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-
Government Arrangements on 13 September 1993 by the Government of Israel and
the Palestine Liberation Organization2 and the subsequent implementation
agreements,

Aware that the Multilateral Working Group on Refugees of the Middle East
peace process has an important role to play in the peace process,

1. Notes with regret that repatriation or compensation of the refugees, as
provided for in paragraph 11 of its resolution 194 (III), has not yet been effected and
that, therefore, the situation of the Palestine refugees continues to be a matter of
concern;

2. Also notes with regret that the United Nations Conciliation Commission
for Palestine has been unable to find a means of achieving progress in the
implementation of paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), and
requests the Commission to exert continued efforts towards the implementation of
that paragraph and to report to the Assembly as appropriate, but not later than
1 September 2004;

3. Affirms the necessity for the continuation of the work of the United
Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and the
importance of its operation and services for the well-being of the Palestine refugees
and for the stability of the region, pending the resolution of the question of the
Palestine refugees;

4. Calls upon all donors to continue to make the most generous efforts
possible to meet the anticipated needs of the Agency, including those mentioned in
recent emergency appeals.
