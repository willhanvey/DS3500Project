  Australia, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Japan, 
Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Spain, 
Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United 
States of America: draft resolution 
 
 

   The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions concerning the situation in Somalia, 
especially resolutions 1814 (2008), 1816 (2008) and 1838 (2008),  

 Continuing to be gravely concerned by the threat that piracy and armed 
robbery at sea against vessels pose to the prompt, safe and effective delivery of 
humanitarian aid to Somalia, to international navigation and the safety of 
commercial maritime routes, and to other vulnerable ships, including fishing 
activities in conformity with international law,  

 Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political 
independence and unity of Somalia,  

 Further reaffirming that international law, as reflected in the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (“the Convention”), sets 
out the legal framework applicable to combating piracy and armed robbery at sea, as 
well as other ocean activities,  

 Taking into account the crisis situation in Somalia, and the lack of capacity of 
the Transitional Federal Government (“TFG”) to interdict pirates or patrol and 
secure either the international sea lanes off the coast of Somalia or Somalia’s 
territorial waters,  

 Taking note of the requests from the TFG for international assistance to 
counter piracy off its coasts, including the 1 September 2008 letter from the 
President of Somalia to the Secretary-General of the United Nations expressing the 
appreciation of the TFG to the Security Council for its assistance and expressing the 
TFG’s willingness to consider working with other States and regional organizations 
to combat piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, the 
20 November 2008 letter conveying the request of the TFG that the provisions of 
resolution 1816 (2008) be renewed, and the 20 November request of the Permanent 
Representative of Somalia before the Security Council that the renewal be for an 
additional 12 months, 

 Further taking note of the letters from the TFG to the Secretary-General 
providing advance notification with respect to States cooperating with the TFG in 
the fight against piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia and from 



S/2008/748  
 

08-63023 2 
 

other Member States to the Security Council to inform the Council of their actions, 
as requested in paragraphs 7 and 12 of resolution 1816 (2008), and encouraging 
those cooperating States, for which advance notification has been provided by the 
TFG to the Secretary-General, to continue their respective efforts,  

 Expressing again its determination to ensure the long-term security of World 
Food Programme (WFP) maritime deliveries to Somalia,  

 Recalling that in its resolution 1838 (2008) it commended the contribution 
made by some States since November 2007 to protect WFP maritime convoys, and 
the establishment by the European Union (EU) of a coordination unit with the task 
of supporting the surveillance and protection activities carried out by some member 
States of the European Union off the coast of Somalia, as well as other international 
and national initiatives taken with a view to implementing resolutions 1814 (2008) 
and 1816 (2008), 

 Emphasizing that peace and stability within Somalia, the strengthening of State 
institutions, economic and social development and respect for human rights and the 
rule of law are necessary to create the conditions for a full eradication of piracy and 
armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, 

 Welcoming the signing of a peace and reconciliation Agreement (“the Djibouti 
Agreement”) between the TFG and the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia on 
19 August 2008, as well as their signing of a joint ceasefire agreement on 
26 October 2008, noting that the Djibouti Agreement calls for the United Nations to 
authorize and deploy an international stabilization force, and further noting the 
Secretary-General’s report on Somalia of 17 November 2008, including his 
recommendations in this regard, 

 Commending the key role played by the African Union Mission to Somalia 
(AMISOM) in facilitating delivery of humanitarian assistance to Somalia through 
the port of Mogadishu and the contribution that AMISOM has made towards the 
goal of establishing lasting peace and stability in Somalia, and recognizing 
specifically the important contributions of the Governments of Uganda and Burundi 
to Somalia,  

 Welcoming the organization of a ministerial meeting of the Security Council in 
December 2008 to examine ways to improve international coordination in the fight 
against piracy and armed robbery off the coast of Somalia and to ensure that the 
international community has the proper authorities and tools at its disposal to assist 
it in these efforts, 

 Determining that the incidents of piracy and armed robbery against vessels in 
the territorial waters of Somalia and the high seas off the coast of Somalia 
exacerbate the situation in Somalia which continues to constitute a threat to 
international peace and security in the region,  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 

 1. Reiterates that it condemns and deplores all acts of piracy and armed 
robbery against vessels in territorial waters and the high seas off the coast of 
Somalia;  



 S/2008/748
 

3 08-63023 
 

 2. Expresses its concern over the finding contained in the 20 November 
2008 report of the Monitoring Group on Somalia that escalating ransom payments 
are fuelling the growth of piracy off the coast of Somalia;  

 3. Welcomes the efforts of the International Maritime Organization (“IMO”) 
to update its guidance and recommendations to the shipping industry and to 
Governments for preventing and suppressing piracy and armed robbery at sea and to 
provide this guidance as soon as practicable to all Member States and to the 
international shipping community operating off the coast of Somalia;  

 4. Calls upon States, in cooperation with the shipping industry, the 
insurance industry and the IMO, to issue to ships entitled to fly their flag 
appropriate advice and guidance on avoidance, evasion, and defensive techniques 
and measures to take if under the threat of attack or attack when sailing in the 
waters off the coast of Somalia;  

 5. Further calls upon States and interested organizations, including the 
IMO, to provide technical assistance to Somalia and nearby coastal States upon their 
request to enhance the capacity of these States to ensure coastal and maritime 
security, including combating piracy and armed robbery at sea off the Somali and 
nearby coastlines;  

 6. Welcomes initiatives by Canada, Denmark, France, India, the 
Netherlands, the Russian Federation, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States 
of America, and by regional and international organizations to counter piracy off the 
coast of Somalia pursuant to resolutions 1814 (2008), 1816 (2008) and 1838 (2008), 
the decision by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to counter piracy off 
the Somalia coast, including by escorting vessels of the WFP, and in particular the 
decision by the EU on 10 November 2008 to launch, for a period of 12 months from 
December 2008, a naval operation to protect WFP maritime convoys bringing 
humanitarian assistance to Somalia and other vulnerable ships, and to repress acts of 
piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia;  

 7. Calls upon States and regional organizations to coordinate, including by 
sharing information through bilateral channels or the United Nations, their efforts to 
deter acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia in cooperation 
with each other, the IMO, the international shipping community, flag States, and the 
TFG;  

 8. Requests the Secretary-General to present to it a report, no later than 
three months after the adoption of this resolution, on ways to ensure the long-term 
security of international navigation off the coast of Somalia, including the long-term 
security of WFP maritime deliveries to Somalia and a possible coordination and 
leadership role for the United Nations in this regard to rally Member States and 
regional organizations to counter piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of 
Somalia;  

 9. Calls upon States and regional organizations that have the capacity to do 
so, to take part actively in the fight against piracy and armed robbery at sea off the 
coast of Somalia, in particular, consistent with this resolution and relevant 
international law, by deploying naval vessels and military aircraft, and through 
seizure and disposition of boats, vessels, arms and other related equipment used in 
the commission of piracy and armed robbery off the coast of Somalia, or for which 
there is reasonable ground for suspecting such use;  



S/2008/748  
 

08-63023 4 
 

 10. Decides that for a period of 12 months from the date of this resolution 
States and regional organizations cooperating with the TFG in the fight against 
piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, for which advance 
notification has been provided by the TFG to the Secretary-General, may: 

 (a) Enter into the territorial waters of Somalia for the purpose of repressing 
acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea, in a manner consistent with such action 
permitted on the high seas with respect to piracy under relevant international law; 
and 

 (b) Use, within the territorial waters of Somalia, in a manner consistent with 
such action permitted on the high seas with respect to piracy under relevant 
international law, all necessary means to repress acts of piracy and armed robbery at 
sea;  

 11. Affirms that the authorizations provided in this resolution apply only with 
respect to the situation in Somalia and shall not affect the rights or obligations or 
responsibilities of Member States under international law, including any rights or 
obligations under the Convention, with respect to any other situation, and 
underscores in particular that this resolution shall not be considered as establishing 
customary international law; and affirms further that such authorizations have been 
provided only following the receipt of the 20 November letter conveying the 
consent of the TFG; 

 12. Affirms that the measures imposed by paragraph 5 of resolution 
733 (1992) and further elaborated upon by paragraphs 1 and 2 of resolution 
1425 (2002) do not apply to supplies of technical assistance to Somalia solely for 
the purposes set out in paragraph 5 above which have been exempted from those 
measures in accordance with the procedure set out in paragraphs 11 (b) and 12 of 
resolution 1772 (2007);  

 13. Requests that cooperating States take appropriate steps to ensure that the 
activities they undertake pursuant to the authorization in paragraph 10 do not have 
the practical effect of denying or impairing the right of innocent passage to the ships 
of any third State;  

 14. Calls upon all States, and in particular flag, port and coastal States, 
States of the nationality of victims and perpetrators of piracy and armed robbery, 
and other States with relevant jurisdiction under international law and national 
legislation, to cooperate in determining jurisdiction, and in the investigation and 
prosecution of persons responsible for acts of piracy and armed robbery off the 
coast of Somalia, consistent with applicable international law including 
international human rights law, and to render assistance by, among other actions, 
providing disposition and logistics assistance with respect to persons under their 
jurisdiction and control, such victims and witnesses and persons detained as a result 
of operations conducted under this resolution; 

 15. Notes that the 1988 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts 
Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (“SUA Convention”) provides for parties 
to create criminal offences, establish jurisdiction, and accept delivery of persons 
responsible for or suspected of seizing or exercising control over a ship by force or 
threat thereof or any other form of intimidation; urges States parties to the SUA 
Convention to fully implement their obligations under said convention and 
cooperate with the Secretary-General and the IMO to build judicial capacity for the 



 S/2008/748
 

5 08-63023 
 

successful prosecution of persons suspected of piracy and armed robbery at sea off 
the coast of Somalia;  

 16. Requests States and regional organizations cooperating with the TFG to 
inform the Security Council and the Secretary-General within nine months of the 
progress of actions undertaken in the exercise of the authority provided in 
paragraph 10 above;  

 17. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Security Council within 
11 months of adoption of this resolution on the implementation of this resolution 
and on the situation with respect to piracy and armed robbery in territorial waters 
and the high seas off the coast of Somalia; 

 18. Requests the Secretary-General of the IMO to brief the Council on the 
basis of cases brought to his attention by the agreement of all affected coastal States, 
and duly taking into account the existing bilateral and regional cooperative 
arrangements, on the situation with respect to piracy and armed robbery; 

 19. Expresses its intention to review the situation and consider, as 
appropriate, renewing the authority provided in paragraph 10 above for additional 
periods upon the request of the TFG; 

 20. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
