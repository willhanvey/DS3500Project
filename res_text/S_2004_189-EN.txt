Draft resolution

The Security Council,

Recalling its resolution 1521 (2003) of 22 December 2003, and its other
previous resolutions and statements by its President on the situation in Liberia and
West Africa,

Noting with concern that the actions and policies of former Liberian President
Charles Taylor and other persons, in particular their depletion of Liberian resources,
and their removal from Liberia and secreting of Liberian funds and property from
that country, have undermined Liberia’s transition to democracy and the orderly
development of its political, administrative, and economic institutions and
resources,

Recognizing the negative impact on Liberia of the transfer abroad of
misappropriated funds and assets and the need for the international community to
ensure as soon as possible, in accordance with paragraph 6 below, the return of such
funds and assets to Liberia,

Also expressing concern that former President Taylor, in collaboration with
others still closely associated with him, continues to exercise control over and to
have access to such misappropriated funds and property, with which he and his
associates are able to engage in activities that undermine peace and stability in
Liberia and the region,

Determining that this situation constitutes a threat to international peace and
security in West Africa, in particular to the peace process in Liberia,

Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,

1. Decides that, to prevent former Liberian President Charles Taylor, his
immediate family members, in particular Jewell Howard Taylor and Charles Taylor,

interfere in the restoration of peace and stability in Liberia and the sub-region, all

thereafter, funds, other financial assets and economic resources owned or controlled
directly or indirectly by Charles Taylor, Jewell Howard Taylor, and Charles Taylor,
Jr. and/or those other individuals designated by the Committee, including funds,
other financial assets and economic resources held by entities owned or controlled,

directly or indirectly, by any of them or by any persons acting on their behalf or at
their direction, as designated by the Committee, shall freeze without delay all such

incurred expenses associated with the provision of legal services, or fees or service
charges for routine holding or maintenance of frozen funds, other financial assets
and economic resources, after notification by the relevant State(s) to the Committee

assets and economic resources and in the absence of a negative decision by the
Committee within two working days of such notification;

(b) have been determined by relevant State(s) to be necessary for
extraordinary expenses, provided that such determination has been notified by the

(c) have been determined by relevant State(s) to be the subject of a judicial
administrative, or arbitral lien or judgement, in which case the funds, other financial
assets and economic resources may be used to satisfy that lien or judgement
provided that the lien or judgement: was entered prior to the date of the present
resolution; is not for the benefit of a person referred to in paragraph 1 above or an
individual or entity identified by the Committee; and has been notified by the
relevant State(s) to the Committee;

3. Decides that all States may allow for the addition to accounts subject to
the provisions of paragraph 1 above of:

(a) interest or other earnings due on those accounts; and

(b) payments due under contracts, agreements or obligations that arose prior
to the date on which those accounts became subject to the provisions of paragraph 1
above;

provided that any such interest, other earnings and payments continue to be subject
to those provisions;

4. Further decides that the Committee shall:

above, and promptly circulate to all States a list of said individuals and entities,
including by posting such a list on the Committee’s web site;

once a year, the first review taking place by December 22, 2004 in conjunction with
its review of the measures imposed in paragraphs 2, 4, 6 and 10 of resolution 1521
(2003), and to determine at that time what further action is appropriate;

6. Expresses its intention to consider whether and how to make available the
funds, other financial assets and economic resources frozen pursuant to paragraph 1
above to the Government of Liberia, once that Government has established
transparent accounting and auditing mechanisms to ensure the responsible use of
government revenue to benefit directly the people of Liberia;

7. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
