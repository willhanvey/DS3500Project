League of Arab States, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of China, France, the 
Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the 
United States of America, Turkey, Iraq (Chair of the Summit of the League of Arab 
States), Kuwait (Chair of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the League of Arab 
States) and Qatar (Chair of the Arab Follow-up Committee on Syria of the League 
of Arab States) and the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign 
Affairs and Security Policy met at the United Nations Office at Geneva as the 
Action Group for Syria, chaired by the Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations 
and the League of Arab States to Syria.  

2. The members of the Action Group came together out of grave alarm at the 
situation in the Syrian Arab Republic. They strongly condemn the continued and 
escalating killing, destruction and human rights abuses. They are deeply concerned 
at the failure to protect civilians, the intensification of the violence, the potential for 
even deeper conflict in the country and the regional dimensions of the problem. The 
unacceptable nature and magnitude of the crisis demands a common position and 
joint international action. 

3. The members of the Action Group are committed to the sovereignty, 
independence, national unity and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic. 
They are determined to work urgently and intensively to bring about an end to the 
violence and human rights abuses, and to facilitate the launch of a Syrian-led 
political process leading to a transition that meets the legitimate aspirations of the 
Syrian people and enables them independently and democratically to determine their 
own future. 

4. In order to secure these common objectives, the members of the Action Group 
(a) identified steps and measures by the parties to secure the full implementation of 
the six-point plan and Security Council resolutions 2042 (2012) and 2043 (2012), 
including an immediate cessation of violence in all its forms; (b) agreed on 
principles and guidelines for a political transition that meets the legitimate 
aspirations of the Syrian people; and (c) agreed on actions that they would take to 
implement the objectives in support of the Joint Special Envoy’s efforts to facilitate 
a Syrian-led political process. They are convinced that this can encourage and 
support progress on the ground and will help to facilitate and support a Syrian-led 
transition. 
 

  Identified steps and measures by the parties to secure the full implementation of 
the six-point plan and Security Council resolutions 2042 (2012) and 2043 (2012), 
including an immediate cessation of violence in all its forms 
 

5. The parties must fully implement the six-point plan and Security Council 
resolutions 2042 (2012) and 2043 (2012). To that end: 

 (a) All parties must recommit to a sustained cessation of armed violence in 
all its forms and to the implementation of the six-point plan immediately and

without waiting for the actions of others. The Government and armed opposition 
groups must cooperate with the United Nations Supervision Mission in the Syrian 
Arab Republic (UNSMIS), with a view to furthering the implementation of the plan 
in accordance with the Mission’s mandate; 

 (b) A cessation of armed violence must be sustained, with immediate, 
credible and visible actions by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic to 
implement the other items of the six-point plan, including: 

 (i) Intensification of the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained 
persons, including especially vulnerable categories of persons, and persons 
involved in peaceful political activities; the provision, without delay and 
through appropriate channels, of a list of all places in which such persons are 
being detained; the immediate organization of access to such locations; and the 
provision, through appropriate channels, of prompt responses to all written 
requests for information, access or release regarding such persons; 

 (ii) Ensuring freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists 
and a non-discriminatory visa policy for them; 

 (iii) Respecting freedom of association and the right to demonstrate 
peacefully, as legally guaranteed;  

 (c) In all circumstances, all parties must show full respect for the safety and 
security of UNSMIS and fully cooperate with and facilitate the Mission in all 
respects; 

 (d) In all circumstances, the Government must allow immediate and full 
humanitarian access by humanitarian organizations to all areas affected by the 
fighting. The Government and all parties must enable the evacuation of the wounded, 
and all civilians who wish to leave must be enabled to do so. All parties must fully 
adhere to their obligations under international law, including in relation to the 
protection of civilians. 
 

  Agreed principles and guidelines for a Syrian-led transition 
 

6. The members of the Action Group agreed on the principles and guidelines for 
a Syrian-led transition set out below. 

7. Any political settlement must deliver to the people of the Syrian Arab Republic a 
transition that: 

 (a) Offers a perspective for the future that can be shared by all in the Syrian 
Arab Republic; 

 (b) Establishes clear steps according to a firm timetable towards the realization 
of that perspective; 

 (c) Can be implemented in a climate of safety for all and of stability and calm; 

 (d) Is reached rapidly without further bloodshed and violence and is credible. 

8. Perspective for the future. The aspirations of the people of the Syrian Arab 
Republic have been clearly expressed by the wide range of Syrians consulted. There 
is an overwhelming wish for a State that: 



 S/2013/575
 

11/13 13-48929 
 

 (a) Is genuinely democratic and pluralistic, giving space to established and 
newly emerging political actors to compete fairly and equally in elections. This also 
means that the commitment to multiparty democracy must be a lasting one, going 
beyond an initial round of elections; 

 (b) Complies with international standards on human rights, the independence 
of the judiciary, accountability of those in Government and the rule of law. It is not 
enough just to enunciate such a commitment. There must be mechanisms available 
to the people to ensure that these commitments are kept by those in authority; 

 (c) Offers equal opportunities and chances for all. There is no room for 
sectarianism or discrimination on ethnic, religious, linguistic or any other grounds. 
Numerically smaller communities must be assured that their rights will be respected. 

9. Clear steps in the transition. The conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic will 
end only when all sides are assured that there is a peaceful way towards a common 
future for all in the country. It is therefore essential that any settlement provide for 
clear and irreversible steps in the transition according to a fixed time frame. The key 
steps in any transition include: 

 (a) The establishment of a transitional governing body that can establish a 
neutral environment in which the transition can take place, with the transitional 
governing body exercising full executive powers. It could include members of the 
present Government and the opposition and other groups and shall be formed on the 
basis of mutual consent;  

 (b) It is for the Syrian people to determine the future of the country. All 
groups and segments of society in the Syrian Arab Republic must be enabled to 
participate in a national dialogue process. That process must be not only inclusive 
but also meaningful. In other words, its key outcomes must be implemented; 

 (c) On that basis, there can be a review of the constitutional order and the 
legal system. The result of constitutional drafting would be subject to popular 
approval; 

 (d) Upon establishment of the new constitutional order, it will be necessary 
to prepare for and conduct free and fair multiparty elections for the new institutions 
and offices that have been established; 

 (e) Women must be fully represented in all aspects of the transition. 

10. Safety, stability and calm. Any transition involves change. However, it is 
essential to ensure that the transition can be implemented in a way that ensures the 
safety of all in an atmosphere of stability and calm. This requires: 

 (a) Consolidation of full calm and stability. All parties must cooperate with 
the transitional governing body to ensure the permanent cessation of violence. This 
includes completion of withdrawals and addressing the issue of the disarmament, 
demobilization and reintegration of armed groups; 

 (b) Effective steps to ensure that vulnerable groups are protected and that 
immediate action is taken to address humanitarian issues in areas of need. It is also 
necessary to ensure that the release of the detained is completed rapidly; 

 (c) Continuity of governmental institutions and qualified staff. Public 
services must be preserved or restored. This includes the military forces and security

services. However, all governmental institutions, including the intelligence services, 
have to perform according to human rights and professional standards and operate 
under a leadership that inspires public confidence, under the control of the 
transitional governing body; 

 (d) Commitment to accountability and national reconciliation. Accountability 
for acts committed during the present conflict must be addressed. There also needs 
to be a comprehensive package for transitional justice, including compensation or 
rehabilitation for victims of the present conflict, steps towards national reconciliation 
and forgiveness. 

11. Rapid steps to come to a credible political agreement. It is for the people of 
the Syrian Arab Republic to come to a political agreement, but time is running out. 
It is clear that: 

 (a) The sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of the 
Syrian Arab Republic must be respected; 

 (b) The conflict must be resolved through peaceful dialogue and negotiation 
alone. Conditions conducive to a political settlement must now be put in place; 

 (c) There must be an end to the bloodshed. All parties must recommit 
themselves credibly to the six-point plan. This must include a cessation of armed 
violence in all its forms and immediate, credible and visible actions to implement 
points 2 to 6 of the six-point plan; 

 (d) All parties must now engage genuinely with the Joint Special Envoy. The 
parties must be prepared to put forward effective interlocutors to work expeditiously 
towards a Syrian-led settlement that meets the legitimate aspirations of the people. 
The process must be fully inclusive in order to ensure that the views of all segments 
of Syrian society are heard in shaping the political settlement for the transition; 

 (e) The organized international community, including the members of the 
Action Group, stands ready to offer significant support for the implementation of an 
agreement reached by the parties. This may include an international assistance 
presence under a United Nations mandate if requested. Significant funds will be 
available to support reconstruction and rehabilitation.
