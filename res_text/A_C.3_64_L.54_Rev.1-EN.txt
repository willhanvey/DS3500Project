 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 52/111 of 12 December 1997, in which it decided to

and Related Intolerance, and its resolutions 56/266 of 27 March 2002, 57/195 of

 Noting Human Rights Council decision 3/103 of 8 December 2006,2 by which, 
heeding the decision and instruction of the 2001 World Conference, the Council 
established the Ad Hoc Committee of the Human Rights Council on the Elaboration 
of Complementary Standards,  

 Bearing in mind the responsibility and obligations of the Human Rights 
Council emanating from the outcome of the Durban Review Conference,3 

 Reiterating that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights 
and have the potential to contribute constructively to the development and well-
being of their societies, and that any doctrine of racial superiority is scientifically 
false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and must be rejected, 
together with theories that attempt to determine the existence of separate human 
races,  

 Convinced that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance manifest themselves in a differentiated manner for women and girls and 
may be among the factors leading to a deterioration in their living conditions, 
poverty, violence, multiple forms of discrimination and the limitation or denial of 
their human rights, and recognizing the need to integrate a gender perspective into 
relevant policies, strategies and programmes of action against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in order to address multiple 
forms of discrimination,  

 Underlining the primacy of political will, international cooperation and 
adequate funding at the national, regional and international levels needed to address 
all forms and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance,  

 Alarmed at the increase in racist violence and xenophobic ideas in many parts 
of the world, in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in society at 
large, inter alia, as a result of the resurgent activities of associations established on 
the basis of racist and xenophobic platforms and charters, and the persistent use of 
those platforms and charters to promote or incite racist ideologies,  

 Underlining the importance of urgently eliminating continuing and violent 
trends involving racism and racial discrimination, and conscious that any form of 
impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in 
weakening the rule of law and democracy, tends to encourage the recurrence of such 
crimes and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication,  

 Welcoming the continued commitment of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to profile and increase the visibility of the struggle 
against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and 
recognizing the need for the High Commissioner to make this a cross-cutting issue 
in the activities and programmes of her Office,
