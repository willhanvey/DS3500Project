the United Nations,1 which states, inter alia, that no State may use or encourage the 

use of unilateral economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another 

State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights,  

 Bearing in mind the general principles governing the international trading

 Recognizing that such measures constitute a flagrant violation of the principles 

of international law as set forth in the Charter, as well as the basic principles of the 

multilateral trading system, 

 Noting with great concern the severe negative impact on human health, safety 

and well-being caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as 

the severe disruption to societies and economies and the devastating impact on lives 

and livelihoods, and that the poorest and most vulnerable are the hardest hit by the 

pandemic, reaffirming the ambition to get back on track to achieve the Sustainable 

Development Goals by designing and implementing sustainable and inclusive 

recovery strategies to accelerate progress towards the full implementation of the 2030 

Agenda for Sustainable Development and to help to reduce the risk of and build 

resilience to future shocks, crises and pandemics, including by strengthening health 

systems and achieving universal health coverage, and recognizing that equitable and 

timely access for all to safe, quality, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccines, 

therapeutics and diagnostics are an essential part of a global response based on unity, 

solidarity, renewed multilateral cooperation and the principle of leaving no one 

behind, 

 Considering that the enactment and application of unilateral coercive economic 

measures that are inconsistent with the principles of international law and the Charter 

have a negative impact on the capacity of targeted countries to respond efficiently, 

including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically in the acquisition 

and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, medical equipment and supplies to 

adequately treat their populations in the face of this pandemic and to promote p ost-

pandemic recovery, and welcoming the appeal by the Secretary-General for the 

waiving of sanctions imposed on countries to ensure access to food, essential health 

supplies and COVID-19 medical support,  

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;2 

 2. Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures 

to eliminate the use of unilateral economic, financial or trade measures that are not 

authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations, that are inconsistent with the 

principles of international law or the Charter of the United Nations or that contravene 

the basic principles of the multilateral trading system and that affect, in particular, 

but not exclusively, developing countries;  

 3. Takes note of the Bridgetown Covenant , adopted at the fifteenth session 

of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, held in Barbados from 

3 to 7 October 2021, in which States are strongly urged to refrain from promulgating 

and applying any unilateral economic, financial or trade measures not in accordance 

with international law and the Charter, in the light of concerns over the constraining 

nature and development implications of such measures that negatively impact the 

well-being of the populations and can impede the full achievement of economic and 

social development in the concerned States, as well as impair their trade relations;  

 4. Calls upon the international community to condemn and reject the 

imposition of the use of such measures as a means of political and economic coercion 

against developing countries that impedes the full achievement of economic and 

social development;  

 5. Also calls upon the international community to condemn and reject the 

imposition of unilateral coercive economic measures that are inconsistent with the 

principles of international law and the Charter, which impede the capacity of targeted

countries to respond efficiently in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to 

promote post-pandemic recovery;  

 6. Requests the Secretary-General to monitor the imposition of unilateral 

economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion and to study the 

impact of such measures on the affected countries, including the impact on trade and 

development;  

 7. Also requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at 

its seventy-eighth session a report on the implementation of the present resolution,
