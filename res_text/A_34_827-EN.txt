"The General As sembly,

"Bearing in mind that the promotion of good neighbourly relations among
the States and the peoples of the world is one of the fundamental goals of
the Charter of the United Nations,

"Noting that the principle of good neighbourliness is also contained
in numerous bilateral and multilateral treaties,

"Recalling its resolutions 1236 (XII) of 14 December 1957 and
1301 (XIII) of 10 December 1958 Which stressed the importance of constantly
promoting good neighbourly relations for the peace and security of all peoples
and for the development of co-operation among States,

"Bearing in mind that, due to geographic proximity, there are particularly
favourable opportunities for co-operation and mutual advantage between
neighbouring countries in many fields and that these opportunities should
be promoted and encouraged, in view of their positive influence on
international relations as a whole,

"Considering that the great changes of a political, economic and social
nature, as well as the scientific and technological progress which have
taken place in the world and led to unprecedented interdependence of nations,
have given new dimensions to the principle of good neighbourliness and
increase the need to ensure its further development and its more effective
implementation in the conduct of States in all fields,

fiConvinced that the development and strengthening of the principle of
good neighbourliness are likely to contribute to the equitable solution of
problems between States, and in particular between neighbouring ones, and to
the enhancing of confidence between them,

between States, particularly neighbouring ones, which endanger the peace,
security and progress of States,

and legal content, as well as ways and modalities to enhance its effectiveness;

their views and suggestions on the content of the principle of good
neighbourliness, as well as on ways and modalities to enhance it, with a
view to preventing conflicts and to increasing confidence among States,

"s. Invites the United Nations organs, bodies and programmes, as well
as specialized agencies, to inform the Secretary-General of the aspects of
their activities relevant for the development of relations of good

wi th paragraphs 4 and S above;

the Charter concerning the duty of States not to intervene and not to
interfere in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of any State and not
to threaten or use force against their territorial integrity or political
independence,

"Alarmed by the frequent recourse to forei gn military interventions,
threats or use of force, open aggression, intimidations, escalation of
military presence with the aim of intervening in the internal and external
affairs of independent States and overthrowing Governments and regiffies,
established according to the will of their people,

"Deeply concerned that, apart from direct military interventions,
numerous violations of the principle of non-interference pose a threat to
the independence of States and the freedom of peoples as well: different
forms of infiltration, sUbversion, subtle forms of destabilization;
instigation by foreign pressure groups and lobbies for the ends of local
and expatriate groups, whose actions are aimed at affecting the independence,
unity and territorial integrity of sovereign States; use of mercenaries

essential to the fulfilment of the purposes and principles of the United
Nations,

economic, social and cultural development of countries and peoples, and also
endangers international peace and security,

of 10 December 1958, in which it stressed the importance of constantly promoting
good neighbourly relations for the peace and security of all peoples and for
the development of co-operation among States,

favourable opportunities for co-operation and mutual advantage between
neighbouring countries in many fields and that these opportunities should be
further promoted and encouraged, in view of their positive influence on
international relations as a whole,

Considering that the great changes of a political, economic and social
nature, as well as the scientific and technological progress which have taken
place in the world and led to unprecedented interdependence of nations, have given
new dimensions to good neighbourliness and increase the need to ensure its further
development and its more effective implementation in the conduct of States in
all fields,

are likely to contribute to the solution of problems between States, particularly
between neighbouring ones, and to the enhancing of confidence between them,

Deeply concerned at the persistence and emergence of conflicts between
States, particularly neighbouring ones, which endanger the peace, security and
progress of States,

Considering that the generalization of the long practice and certain norms
of good neighbourliness is likely to strengthen friendly relations and co-operation
among States, in accordance with the Charter,

1. Calls upon all States, in the interest of the maintenance of
international peace and security, to promote good neighbourliness in their
relations with other States;

rejection of any acts seeking to establish zones of influence and domination;

in order to strengthen and further develop its content, as well as ways and
modalities to enhance its effectiveness;

4. Invites Governments to cow~unicate to the Secretary-General their

the specialized agencies, within their fields of competence, to inform the

of establishing the new international economic order,

Recognizing some encouraging signs and achievements of the peoples' struggle
for their emancipation and liberation from colonial and other forms of
subjugation and oppression, thus contributing to the strengthening of
international peace and security, but conscious of the necessity to exert
further efforts towards consolidating and expanding the results aChieved,
