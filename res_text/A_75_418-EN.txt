 The General Assembly, 

 Having considered the item entitled “Implementation of the Declaration on the 

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized 

agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations”,  

 Having also considered the report of the Secretary-General1 and the report of 

the Economic and Social Council2 on the item, 

 Having examined the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with  

regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to 

Colonial Countries and Peoples for 2020,3 

 Recalling its resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 and 1541 (XV) of

relevant resolutions and decisions, including, in particular, Economic and Social

are small island Territories, 

 Welcoming the assistance extended to Non-Self-Governing Territories by certain 

specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, 

 Welcoming also the participation in the capacity of observers of those Non-Self-

Governing Territories that are associate members of regional commissions in the

in meeting those challenges without the continuing cooperation and assistance of the 

specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system,

expanded programmes of assistance for the peoples concerned and the need to enlist 

the support of all major funding institutions within the United Nations system in that

of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system in 

the implementation of the various resolutions and decisions of the United Nations

Governing Territories and their vulnerability to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, 

cyclones and sea level rise, and recalling the relevant resolutions of the General 

Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 74/95 of 13 December 2019 on the implementation of 

the Declaration by the specialized agencies and the international institutions

Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), and other relevant resolutions of the United Nations;

 4. Also reaffirms that the recognition by the General Assembly, the Security

of the United Nations system and regional organizations to strengthen existing
