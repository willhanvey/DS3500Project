Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the
specialized agencies and the international institutions
associated with the United Nations

The General Assembly,

Having considered the item entitled “Implementation of the Declaration on the
Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized
agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations”,

Having also considered the report of the Secretary-General1 and the report of
the Economic and Social Council2 on the item,

Having examined the chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the
Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples relating to the item,3

Recalling General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 and
1541 (XV) of 15 December 1960 and the resolutions of the Special Committee, as
well as other relevant resolutions and decisions, including in particular Economic
and Social Council resolution 2003/51 of 24 July 2003,

Bearing in mind the relevant provisions of the final documents of the
successive Conferences of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries
and of the resolutions adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government
of the African Union, the Pacific Islands Forum and the Caribbean Community,

Conscious of the need to facilitate the implementation of the Declaration on
the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in
resolution 1514 (XV),

Noting that the large majority of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories
are small island Territories,

Welcoming the assistance extended to Non-Self-Governing Territories by
certain specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system,
in particular the United Nations Development Programme,

Also welcoming the current participation in the capacity of observers of those
Non-Self-Governing Territories that are associate members of regional commissions
in the world conferences in the economic and social sphere, subject to the rules of
procedure of the General Assembly and in accordance with relevant United Nations
resolutions and decisions, including resolutions and decisions of the Assembly and
the Special Committee on specific Territories,

Stressing that, because the development options of the small island Non-Self-
Governing Territories are limited, there are special challenges to planning for and
implementing sustainable development and that those Territories will be constrained
in meeting the challenges without the continuing cooperation and assistance of the
specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system,

expanded programmes of assistance for the peoples concerned and the need to enlist
the support of all major funding institutions within the United Nations system in that
regard,

of the United Nations system to take all appropriate measures, within their
respective spheres of competence, to ensure the full implementation of General

the Caribbean Community and other regional organizations for the continued
cooperation and assistance they have extended to the specialized agencies and other
organizations of the United Nations system in this regard,

Expressing its conviction that closer contacts and consultations between and
among the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations
system and regional organizations help to facilitate the effective formulation of
programmes of assistance to the peoples concerned,

Mindful of the imperative need to keep under continuous review the activities
of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system in
the implementation of the various United Nations decisions relating to
decolonization,

Bearing in mind the extremely fragile economies of the small island Non-Self-
Governing Territories and their vulnerability to natural disasters, such as hurricanes,

of the United Nations system and regional organizations to strengthen existing
