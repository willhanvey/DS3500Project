Recalling in particular that in its resolution 2005/11, the Commission on
Human Rights urged the General Assembly to take up the question of the situation
of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea if the Government
did not extend cooperation to the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on the
situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and if
improvement of the situation of human rights in the country was not observed,

Taking note of the report of the Special Rapporteur,7

1. Expresses its serious concern at:

(a) The refusal of the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea to recognize the mandate of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on
Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic
of Korea or to extend cooperation to him;

(b) Continuing reports of systemic, widespread and grave violations of
human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, including:

(i) Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,
public executions, extrajudicial and arbitrary detention, the absence of due
process and the rule of law, the imposition of the death penalty for political
reasons, the existence of a large number of prison camps and the extensive use
of forced labour;

(ii) Sanctions imposed on citizens of the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea who have been repatriated from abroad, such as treating their departure
as treason, leading to punishments of internment, torture, cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or the death penalty;

(iii) All-pervasive and severe restrictions on the freedoms of thought,
conscience, religion, opinion and expression, peaceful assembly and
association, and on equal access to information and limitations imposed on
every person who wishes to move freely within the country and travel abroad;

(iv) Continued violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of
women, in particular the trafficking of women for the purpose of prostitution
or forced marriage, forced abortions, and infanticide of children of repatriated
mothers, including in police detention centres and camps;

(v) Unresolved questions relating to the abduction of foreigners in the form
of an enforced disappearance;

2. Expresses its concern that the Government of the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea has not engaged in technical cooperation activities with the
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and her Office, despite
efforts by the High Commissioner to engage in a dialogue with the authorities of the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in this regard;

3. Expresses its deep concern at the precarious humanitarian situation in the
country, in particular the prevalence of infant malnutrition, which still affects the
physical and mental development of a significant proportion of children;

4. Urges the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, in
this regard, to ensure that humanitarian organizations, including non-governmental
organizations and United Nations organizations, in particular the World Food
Programme, have full, free, safe and unimpeded access to all parts of the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in order that they may ensure that
humanitarian assistance is delivered impartially on the basis of need in accordance
with humanitarian principles, this concern having been aggravated by the
announcement by the authorities of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea of
their intention not to accept humanitarian assistance from January 2006;

5. Also urges the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea to fully respect all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, in this
regard, to implement fully the measures set out in the above-mentioned resolutions
of the Commission on Human Rights, in particular full cooperation with the Special
Rapporteur.
