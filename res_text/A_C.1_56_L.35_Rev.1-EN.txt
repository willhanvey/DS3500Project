General and complete disarmament

Japan: revised draft resolution

A path to the total elimination of nuclear weapons

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolutions 49/75 H of 15 December 1994, 50/70 C of 12
December 1995, 51/45 G of 10 December 1996, 52/38 K of 9 December 1997,

November 2000,

Recognizing that the enhancement of international peace and security and the
promotion of nuclear disarmament mutually complement and strengthen each other,

Reaffirming the crucial importance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons1 as the cornerstone of the international regime for nuclear non-
proliferation and as an essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament,

Recognizing the progress made by the nuclear-weapon States in the reduction
of their nuclear weapons unilaterally or through negotiations, including the START
process, and the efforts made towards nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation by
the international community,

Reaffirming the conviction that further advancement in nuclear disarmament
will contribute to consolidating the international regime for nuclear non-
proliferation, ensuring international peace and security,

Bearing in mind the recent nuclear tests, as well as the regional situations,
which pose a challenge to international efforts to strengthen the global regime for
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons,

strengthening of the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards system,
including universalization of its safeguards agreements, and their additional
protocols,

Encouraging the Russian Federation and the United States of America to
continue their intensive consultations on the interrelated subjects of offensive and
defensive systems and to complete them with a view to enhancing international

Conference of the Parties to the Treaty:4

(a) The importance and urgency of signatures and ratifications, without delay
and without conditions and in accordance with constitutional processes, to achieve

pending entry into force of that Treaty;

(b) The establishment of an ad hoc committee in the Conference on

material for peaceful purposes in order to ensure that such material remains
permanently outside military programmes;
