 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 48/75 J of 16 December 1993, 49/75 O of 
15 December 1994, 50/70 L of 12 December 1995, 51/45 Q of 10 December 1996, 
52/38 Q of 9 December 1997, 53/77 P of 4 December 1998, 54/54 M of 1 December 
1999, 55/33 P of 20 November 2000, 56/24 I of 29 November 2001, 57/77 of 
22 November 2002, 58/39 of 8 December 2003, 59/88 of 3 December 2004, 60/75 of 
8 December 2005, 61/82 of 6 December 2006, 62/44 of 5 December 2007, 63/44 of 
2 December 2008, 64/42 of 2 December 2009, 65/46 of 8 December 2010, 66/37 of 
2 December 2011 and 67/62 of 3 December 2012, 

 Recognizing the crucial role of conventional arms control in promoting 
regional and international peace and security, 

 Convinced that conventional arms control needs to be pursued primarily in the 
regional and subregional contexts since most threats to peace and security in the 
post-cold-war era arise mainly among States located in the same region or subregion, 

 Aware that the preservation of a balance in the defence capabilities of States at 
the lowest level of armaments would contribute to peace and stability and should be 
a prime objective of conventional arms control, 

 Desirous of promoting agreements to strengthen regional peace and security at 
the lowest possible level of armaments and military forces, 

 Noting with particular interest the initiatives taken in this regard in different 
regions of the world, in particular the commencement of consultations among a 
number of Latin American countries and the proposals for conventional arms control 
made in the context of South Asia, and recognizing, in the context of this subject,

the relevance and value of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe,1 
which is a cornerstone of European security, 

 Believing that militarily significant States and States with larger military 
capabilities have a special responsibility in promoting such agreements for regional 
security, 

 Believing also that an important objective of conventional arms control in 
regions of tension should be to prevent the possibility of military attack launched by 
surprise and to avoid aggression, 

 1. Decides to give urgent consideration to the issues involved in 
conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels; 

 2. Requests the Conference on Disarmament to consider the formulation of 
principles that can serve as a framework for regional agreements on conventional 
arms control, and looks forward to a report of the Conference on this subject; 

 3. Requests the Secretary-General, in the meantime, to seek the views of 
Member States on the subject and to submit a report to the General Assembly at its 
sixty-ninth session;  

 4. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-ninth session, 
under the item entitled “General and complete disarmament”, the sub-item entitled 
“Conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels”.
