 Recalling all resolutions and decisions of the United Nations relating to those 
Territories, including, in particular, the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly 
at its sixty-first session on the individual Territories covered by the present 
resolution, 

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territories 
are valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the 
peoples concerned and in conformity with the clearly defined principles contained 
in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of

information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter of the United Nations, 

 Expressing concern that more than forty-six years after the adoption of the 
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples,2 
there still remain a number of Non-Self-Governing Territories, 

 Conscious of the importance of continuing effective implementation of the 
Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 
colonialism by 2010 and the plan of action for the Second International Decade for 
the Eradication of Colonialism,3

 Noting the stated position of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland, and the stated position of the Government of the 
United States of America on the Non-Self-Governing Territories under their 
administration, 

 Noting also the stated positions of the representatives of the Non-Self-
Governing Territories before the Special Committee and in its regional seminars, 

 Noting further the constitutional developments in some Non-Self-Governing 
Territories affecting the internal structure of governance about which the Special 
Committee has received information, 

 Aware of the importance both to the Territories and to the Special Committee 
of the participation of elected and appointed representatives of the Territories in the 
work of the Special Committee, 

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories 
should continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 
referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 
important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people, 

 Convinced also that any negotiations to determine the status of a Territory 
must take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of that 
Territory, under the aegis of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that 
the views of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories in respect of their 
right to self-determination should be ascertained, 

 Noting that a number of Non-Self-Governing Territories have expressed 
concern at the procedure followed by some administering Powers, contrary to the 
wishes of the Territories themselves, of amending or enacting legislation for 
application to the Territories, either through Orders in Council, in order to apply to 
the Territories the international treaty obligations of the administering Power, or 
through the unilateral application of laws and regulations, 

 Aware of the importance of the international financial services for the 
economies of some of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, 

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the 
local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional 
organizations, 

 Mindful that United Nations visiting and special missions provide an effective 
means of ascertaining the situation in the Territories, that some Territories have not 
received a United Nations visiting mission for a long time and that no visiting 
missions have been sent to some of the Territories, and considering the possibility of 
sending further visiting missions to the Territories at an appropriate time and in 
consultation with the administering Powers, 

 Mindful also that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its 
understanding of the political status of the peoples of the Territories and to fulfil its 
mandate effectively, it is important for it to be apprised by the administering Powers 
and to receive information from other appropriate sources, including the 
representatives of the Territories, concerning the wishes and aspirations of the 
peoples of the Territories, 



 A/62/412
 

15 07-54516 
 

 Recognizing the need for the Special Committee to ensure that the appropriate 
bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at 
assisting the peoples of the Territories in gaining a better understanding of the 
options of self-determination, 

 Mindful, in this connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the 
Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters and other venues, with the active 
participation of representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a 
helpful means for the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate, and that the regional 
nature of the seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a 
crucial element in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the 
political status of the Territories, 

 Mindful also that the 2006 Pacific regional seminar was held on Yanuca Island, 
Fiji, from 28 to 30 November, and that the 2007 Caribbean regional seminar was 
held in Saint George’s, Grenada, from 22 to 24 May, 

 Conscious of the particular vulnerability of the Territories to natural disasters 
and environmental degradation, and, in this connection, bearing in mind the 
applicability to the Territories of the programmes of action of all United Nations 
world conferences4 and special sessions of the General Assembly in the economic 
and social sphere, 

 Noting with appreciation the contribution to the development of some 
Territories by the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations 
system, in particular the United Nations Development Programme, the Economic 
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and the Economic and Social 
Commission for Asia and the Pacific, as well as regional institutions such as the 
Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean Community, the Organization of 
Eastern Caribbean States, the Pacific Islands Forum and the agencies of the Council 
of Regional Organizations in the Pacific, 

 Aware that the Human Rights Committee, as part of its mandate under the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,5 reviews the status of the self-
determination process, including in small island Territories under examination by 
the Special Committee,
