dissenters, political reformists, journalists, parliamentarians, students, clerics,
academics and web bloggers, including through undue restrictions on the freedoms
of assembly, opinion and expression, the use of arbitrary arrest, targeted at both
individuals and their family members and the unjustified closure of newspapers and
blocking of Internet sites, as well as the absence of many necessary conditions for
free and fair elections, including by the arbitrary disqualification of large numbers
of prospective candidates, including all women, during the Presidential elections of
June 2005;

(b) The persistent failure to comply fully with international standards in the
administration of justice and, in particular, the absence of due process of law, the
refusal to provide fair and public hearings, the denial of the right to counsel and
access to counsel by those detained, the use of national security laws to deny human
rights, the harassment, intimidation and persecution of defence lawyers and legal
defenders, the lack of respect for internationally recognized safeguards, inter alia,

A/C.3/60/L.45

prolonged solitary confinement, the failure to provide proper medical care to those
imprisoned and the arbitrary denial of contact between detainees and their family
members;

(c) The continuing use of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment
or punishment such as flogging and amputations;

(d) The continued carrying out of public executions, including multiple
public executions and, on a large scale, other executions in the absence of respect
for internationally recognized safeguards, and, in particular, deplores the execution
of persons who were below 18 years of age at the time their offence was committed,
contrary to the obligations of the Islamic Republic of Iran under article 37 of the
Convention on the Rights of the Child4 and article 6 of the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights2 and in spite of the announcement of a moratorium on
juvenile executions;

(e) The continuing violence and discrimination against women and girls in
law and in practice, despite some minor legislative improvements, and the refusal of
the Guardian Council to take steps to address this systemic discrimination, noting in
this context its rejection, in August 2003, of the proposal of the elected parliament
to accede to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
against Women;6

(f) The continuing discrimination, and other human rights violations against
persons belonging to ethnic and religious minorities, recognized or otherwise,

escalation and increased frequency of discrimination and other human rights
violations against the Bahá’ì, including cases of arbitrary arrest and detention, the
denial of freedom of religion or of publicly carrying out communal affairs, the
disregard of property rights, the destruction of sites of religious importance, the

access to higher education, employment, pensions, adequate housing and other
benefits and recent violent crackdowns on Kurds;

expression, and the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs in accordance

and, in particular, to end the harassment, intimidation and persecution of political
opponents and human rights defenders, including by releasing people imprisoned
arbitrarily or on the basis of their political views;

(b) To ensure full respect for the right to due process of law, including the
right to counsel and access to counsel by those detained, in criminal justice
proceedings and in particular, to ensure a fair and public hearing by a competent,
independent and impartial tribunal established by law, to end harassment,
intimidation and persecution of defence lawyers and legal defenders and to ensure
equality before the law and the equal protection of the law without any
discrimination in all instances, including for members of religious, ethnic, linguistic
or other minority groups, officially recognized or otherwise;

(c) To eliminate, in law and in practice, the use of torture and cruel, inhuman
or other degrading treatment or punishment such as amputations and flogging, to
end impunity for violations of human rights that constitute crimes by bringing the
perpetrators to justice in accordance with international standards and, as proposed
by the elected Iranian parliament, to accede to the Convention against Torture and
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment;7

(d) To abolish public executions and other executions carried out in the
absence of respect for internationally recognized safeguards, in particular
executions for persons who, at the time of their offence, were under the age of 18,

report of January 2005, and to uphold the moratorium on executions by stoning and
to introduce this moratorium as law as a first step towards the abolition of this
punishment;

religious, ethnic or linguistic grounds, and other human rights violations against
persons belonging to minorities, including Arabs, Kurds, Baluchi, Christians, Jews,
Sunni Muslims and the Bahá’ì, and to address this matter in an open manner, with
the full participation of the minorities themselves, to otherwise ensure full respect
for the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief of all persons, and
to implement the 1996 report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on
Human Rights on religious intolerance, which recommended ways the Islamic
Republic of Iran could emancipate the Bahá’ì community;

4. Encourages the thematic mechanisms of the Commission on Human
Rights, inter alia, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary

lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, the Special
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and
expression, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of

Disappearances, to visit or otherwise continue their work to improve the human
rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran, and urges the Government of the
Islamic Republic of Iran to cooperate with these special mechanisms and to
illustrate how their subsequent recommendations have been addressed, including
those of special procedures that have visited in the past twelve months;
