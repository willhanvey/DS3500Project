 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming that terrorism in all forms and manifestations constitutes one of 
the most serious threats to international peace and security and that any acts of 
terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivations, whenever 
and by whomsoever committed and remaining determined to contribute further to 
enhancing the effectiveness of the overall effort to fight this scourge on a global 
level, 

 Reaffirming also that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any 
religion, nationality, civilization or group, 

 Noting with concern that terrorism continues to pose a serious threat to 
international peace and security, the enjoyment of human rights, the social and 
economic development of all Member States, and undermines global stability and 
prosperity, that this threat has become more diffuse, with an increase, in various 
regions of the world, of terrorist acts including those motivated by intolerance or 
extremism, expressing its determination to combat this threat, and stressing the need 
to ensure that counter-terrorism remains a priority on the international agenda, 

 Recognizing that terrorism will not be defeated by military force, law 
enforcement measures, and intelligence operations alone, and underlining the need 
to address the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism, as outlined in Pillar I 
of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (A/60/288) including, but not limited 
to, the need to strengthen efforts for the successful prevention and peaceful 
resolution of prolonged conflict, and the need to promote the rule of law, the 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, good governance, tolerance, 
inclusiveness to offer a viable alternative to those who could be susceptible to 
terrorist recruitment and to radicalization leading to violence, 

 Expressing concern at the increase in incidents of kidnapping and hostage-
taking committed by terrorist groups, in some areas of the world with a specific 
political context, with the aim of raising funds or gaining political concessions,  

 Reiterating the obligation of Member States to prevent and suppress the 
financing of terrorist acts, and criminalize the wilful provision or collection, by any 
means, directly or indirectly, of funds by their nationals or in their territories with 



S/2010/645  
 

10-70205 2 
 

the intention that the funds should be used, or in the knowledge that they are to be 
used, in order to carry out terrorist acts,  

 Reaffirming the obligation of the Member States to freeze without delay funds 
and other financial assets or economic resources of persons who commit, or attempt 
to commit, terrorist acts or participate in or facilitate the commission of terrorist 
acts; of entities owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such persons; and of 
persons and entities acting on behalf of, or at the direction of such persons and 
entities, including funds derived or generated from property owned or controlled 
directly or indirectly by such persons and associated persons and entities, 

 Reaffirming further the obligation of the Member States to prohibit their 
nationals or any persons and entities within their territories from making any funds, 
financial assets or economic resources or financial or other related services 
available, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of persons who commit or attempt to 
commit or facilitate or participate in the commission of terrorist acts, of entities 
owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by such persons and of persons and 
entities acting on behalf of or at the direction of such persons, 

 Reiterating further the obligation of Member States to prevent the movement 
of terrorist groups by, inter alia, effective border controls, and, in this context, to 
exchange information expeditiously, improve cooperation amongst competent 
authorities to prevent the movement of terrorists and terrorist groups to and from 
their territories, the supply of weapons for terrorists and financing that would 
support terrorists,  

 Underlining that safe havens provided to terrorists continue to be a significant 
concern and that all Member States must cooperate fully in the fight against 
terrorism in order to find, deny safe haven and bring to justice, on the basis of the 
principle of extradite or prosecute, any person who supports, facilitates, participates 
or attempts to participate in the financing, planning, preparation or commission of 
terrorist acts or provides safe havens, 

 Recognizing that development, peace and security, and human rights are 
interlinked and mutually reinforcing, and underlining the international effort to 
eradicate poverty and promote sustained economic growth, sustainable development 
and global prosperity for all, 

 Emphasizing that continuing international efforts to enhance dialogue and 
broaden understanding among civilizations in an effort to prevent the indiscriminate 
targeting of different religions and cultures, can help counter the forces that fuel 
polarization and extremism, and will contribute to strengthening the international 
fight against terrorism, and, in this respect, appreciating the positive role of the 
Alliance of Civilizations and other similar initiatives, 

 Reaffirming that Member States must ensure that any measures taken to 
combat terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, in 
particular international human rights, refugee, and humanitarian law, 

 Reaffirming its call upon all States to become party to the international 
counter-terrorism conventions and protocols as soon as possible, whether or not they 
are a party to regional conventions on the matter, and to fully implement their 
obligations under those which they are a party,

solidarity, particularly through bilateral and multilateral arrangements and 
agreements to prevent and suppress terrorist attacks and encourages Member States

 Expressing concern at the increased use, in a globalized society, by terrorists 
of new information and communication technologies, in particular the Internet, for

and preparation of their activities,  

 Recognizing the importance that Member States act cooperatively to prevent 
terrorists from exploiting technology, communications and resources to incite 
support for terrorist acts,

families, stresses the importance of assisting victims of terrorism, and providing 
them and their families with support to cope with their loss and grief, recognizes the 
important role that victims and survivor networks play in countering terrorism,
