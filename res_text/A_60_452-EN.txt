III. Recommendation of the First Committee

8. The First Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the
following draft resolution:

Developments in the field of information and telecommunications
in the context of international security

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolutions 53/70 of 4 December 1998, 54/49 of 1 December
1999, 55/28 of 20 November 2000, 56/19 of 29 November 2001, 57/53 of 22 November
2002, 58/32 of 8 December 2003, and 59/61 of 3 December 2004,

Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the
context of international security, in which, inter alia, it recognized that scientific and
technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and
that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be
maintained and encouraged,

Noting that considerable progress has been achieved in developing and
applying the latest information technologies and means of telecommunication,

Affirming that it sees in this process the broadest positive opportunities for the
further development of civilization, the expansion of opportunities for cooperation
for the common good of all States, the enhancement of the creative potential of
humankind and additional improvements in the circulation of information in the
global community,

Recalling, in this connection, the approaches and principles outlined at the
Information Society and Development Conference, held in Midrand, South Africa,
from 13 to 15 May 1996,

Bearing in mind the results of the Ministerial Conference on Terrorism, held in
Paris on 30 July 1996, and the recommendations that it made,1

Bearing in mind also the results of the first phase of the World Summit on the
Information Society, held in Geneva from 10 to 12 December 2003,2

Noting that the dissemination and use of information technologies and means
affect the interests of the entire international community and that optimum
effectiveness is enhanced by broad international cooperation,

Expressing its concern that these technologies and means can potentially be
used for purposes that are inconsistent with the objectives of maintaining
international stability and security and may adversely affect the integrity of the
infrastructure of States to the detriment of their security in both civil and military
fields,

Considering that it is necessary to prevent the use of information resources or
technologies for criminal or terrorist purposes,

Noting the contribution of those Member States that have submitted their
assessments on issues of information security to the Secretary-General pursuant to
paragraphs 1 to 3 of resolutions 53/70, 54/49, 55/28, 56/19, 57/53, 58/32 and 59/61,

Taking note of the reports of the Secretary-General containing those
assessments,3

Welcoming the initiative taken by the Secretariat and the United Nations
Institute for Disarmament Research in convening an international meeting of experts
in Geneva in August 1999 on developments in the field of information and
telecommunications in the context of international security, as well as its results,

Considering that the assessments of the Member States contained in the
reports of the Secretary-General and the international meeting of experts have
contributed to a better understanding of the substance of issues of international
information security and related notions,

Bearing in mind that the Secretary-General, in fulfilment of resolution 58/32,
established in 2004 a group of governmental experts, which, in accordance with its
mandate, considered existing and potential threats in the sphere of information
security and possible cooperative measures to address them and conducted a study
on relevant international concepts aimed at strengthening the security of global
information and telecommunications systems,

Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on the Group of
Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and
Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, prepared on the basis
of the results of the Group’s work,4

1. Calls upon Member States to promote further at multilateral levels the
consideration of existing and potential threats in the field of information security, as
well as possible measures to limit the threats emerging in this field, consistent with
the need to preserve the free flow of information;

2. Considers that the purpose of such measures could be served through the
examination of relevant international concepts aimed at strengthening the security of
global information and telecommunications systems;

3. Invites all Member States to continue to inform the Secretary-General of
their views and assessments on the following questions:

(a) General appreciation of the issues of information security;

(b) Efforts taken at the national level to strengthen information security and
promote international cooperation in this field;

(c) The content of the concepts mentioned in paragraph 2 above;

(d) Possible measures that could be taken by the international community to
strengthen information security at the global level;

4. Requests the Secretary-General, with the assistance of a group of
governmental experts, to be established in 2009 on the basis of equitable
