 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 48/75 L of 16 December 1993, 53/77 I of 4 December 

1998, 55/33 Y of 20 November 2000, 56/24 J of 29 November 2001, 57/80 of 

22 November 2002, 58/57 of 8 December 2003, 59/81 of 3 December 2004, 64/29 of 

2 December 2009, 65/65 of 8 December 2010, 66/44 of 2 December 2011 and 67/53 

of 3 December 2012, its decisions 68/518 of 5 December 2013 and 69/516 of 

2 December 2014, its resolutions 70/39 of 7 December 2015 and 71/259 

of 23 December 2016, its decision 72/513 of 4 December 2017, its resolution 73/65 

of 5 December 2018 and its decisions 74/509 of 12 December 2019 and 75/515 of 

7 December 2020, on the subject of a treaty banning the production of fissile material 

for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices,  

 Mindful of the continuing importance and relevance of the Conference on 

Disarmament, and recalling the past achievements of that body in successfully 

negotiating non-proliferation and disarmament agreements,  

 Expressing concern at the years of stalemate in the Conference on Disarmament, 

regretting that negotiations have not been pursued on this issue, and looking forward 

to the Conference again fulfilling its mandate as the world’s single multilateral 

disarmament negotiating forum,  

 Convinced that a non-discriminatory, multilateral and effectively verifiable 

treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear 

explosive devices would represent a significant practical contribution to nuclear 

disarmament and non-proliferation efforts,  

 Recognizing the essential role of fissile material in the manufacture of nuclear 

weapons or other nuclear explosive devices and the long-standing efforts of the

international community to negotiate a treaty that would ban its production for such 

purposes, 

 Recognizing also that a future treaty should not prohibit the production of fissile 

material for non-proscribed military purposes or civilian use, consistent with the 

obligations of States parties, or interfere in any other way with a State’s right to 

peaceful uses of nuclear energy, 

 Recalling action 15 of the conclusions and recommendations for follow-on 

actions agreed by consensus at the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the 

Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons1 that, inter alia, the Conference 

on Disarmament should, within the context of an agreed, comprehensive and balanced 

programme of work, immediately begin negotiation of a treaty banning the production 

of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices in  

accordance with the report of the Special Coordinator of 1995 (CD/1299) and the 

mandate contained therein, 

 Noting with appreciation the consensus report of the Group of Governmental 

Experts, mandated in resolution 67/53, as contained in document A/70/81,  

 Noting with appreciation also the work accomplished in 2017 and 2018 by the 

high-level fissile material cut-off treaty expert preparatory group convened by the 

Secretary-General following resolution 71/259, on the basis of equitable geographic 

distribution, to consider and make recommendations on substantial elements of a 

future non-discriminatory, multilateral and effectively verifiable treaty banning the 

production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, 

on the basis of document CD/1299 and the mandate contained therein,  

 Reaffirming the need to ensure the equal, full and meaningful participation of 

women in the negotiation process of a future treaty,  

 Reaffirming also its desire to achieve substantive progress in nuclear 

non-proliferation and disarmament, and in particular on a non-discriminatory, 

multilateral and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material 

for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices,  

 1. Urges the Conference on Disarmament to agree on and implement at its 

earliest opportunity a programme of work that includes the immediate 

commencement of negotiations on a treaty banning the production of fissile material 

for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of document 

CD/1299 and the mandate contained therein;  

 2. Calls upon Member States to make innovative contributions in all 

appropriate formal and informal forums, including the tenth Review Conference of 

the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, for facilitating 

negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a treaty banning the production of 

fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; 

 3. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-seventh 

session, under the item entitled “General and complete disarmament”, the sub -item 

entitled “Treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or 

other nuclear explosive devices”.
