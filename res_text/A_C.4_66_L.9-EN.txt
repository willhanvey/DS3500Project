 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 194 (III) of 11 December 1948 and all its subsequent 
resolutions on the question, including resolution 65/98 of 10 December 2010,  

 Recalling also its resolution 302 (IV) of 8 December 1949, by which, inter 
alia, it established the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine 
Refugees in the Near East,  

 Recalling further the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,  

 Aware of the fact that, for more than six decades, the Palestine refugees have 
suffered from the loss of their homes, lands and means of livelihood,  

 Affirming the imperative of resolving the problem of the Palestine refugees for 
the achievement of justice and for the achievement of lasting peace in the region,  

 Acknowledging the essential role that the United Nations Relief and Works 
Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East has played for over sixty years since 
its establishment in ameliorating the plight of the Palestine refugees through the 



A/C.4/66/L.9  
 

11-58167 2 
 

provision of education, health, relief and social services and ongoing work in the 
areas of camp infrastructure, microfinance, protection and emergency assistance,  

 Taking note of the report of the Commissioner-General of the United Nations 
Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East covering the 
period from 1 January to 31 December 2010,1 

 Aware of the continuing needs of the Palestine refugees throughout all the 
fields of operation, namely, Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic and the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory,  

 Expressing grave concern at the especially difficult situation of the Palestine 
refugees under occupation, including with regard to their safety, well-being and 
socio-economic living conditions, 

 Expressing grave concern in particular at the critical humanitarian situation 
and socio-economic conditions of the Palestine refugees in the Gaza Strip, and 
underlining the importance of emergency and humanitarian assistance and urgent 
reconstruction efforts, 

 Noting the signing of the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-
Government Arrangements2 on 13 September 1993 by the Government of Israel and 
the Palestine Liberation Organization and the subsequent implementation 
agreements, 

 1. Notes with regret that repatriation or compensation of the refugees, as 
provided for in paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), has not yet 
been effected, and that, therefore, the situation of the Palestine refugees continues to 
be a matter of grave concern and the Palestine refugees continue to require 
assistance to meet basic health, education and living needs;  

 2. Also notes with regret that the United Nations Conciliation Commission 
for Palestine has been unable to find a means of achieving progress in the 
implementation of paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), and 
reiterates its request to the Conciliation Commission to continue exerting efforts 
towards the implementation of that paragraph and to report to the Assembly on the 
efforts being exerted in this regard as appropriate, but no later than 1 September 
2012; 

 3. Affirms the necessity for the continuation of the work of the United 
Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and the 
importance of its unimpeded operation and its provision of services for the well-
being and human development of the Palestine refugees and for the stability of the 
region, pending the just resolution of the question of the Palestine refugees;  

 4. Calls upon all donors to continue to make the most generous efforts 
possible to meet the anticipated needs of the United Nations Relief and Works 
Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, including with regard to increased 
expenditures arising from the serious socio-economic and humanitarian situation 
and instability in the region, particularly in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and 
those mentioned in recent emergency appeals;
