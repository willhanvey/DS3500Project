2053 (2012), 

 Reaffirming the basic principles of peacekeeping, including consent of the 

parties, impartiality, and non-use of force, except in self-defence and defence of the 

mandate, and recognizing that the mandate of each peace-keeping mission is 

specific to the need and situation of the country concerned,  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 

territorial integrity of the DRC as well as all States in the region and emphasizing 

the need to respect fully the principles of non-interference, good-neighbourliness 

and regional cooperation,  

 Emphasizing that those responsible for violations of international humanitarian 

law and violations and abuses of human rights must be held accountable and that the 

Government of the DRC bears the primary responsibility to protect civilians within 

its territory and subject to its jurisdiction, including protection from crimes against 

humanity and war crimes, 

 Noting that eastern DRC has continued to suffer from recurring cycles of 

conflict and persistent violence by armed groups, both Congolese and foreign, and 

recalling the strategic importance of the implementation of the Peace, Security and 

Cooperation (PSC) Framework for the DRC and the Region, and reiterating its call 

to all signatories to fulfil promptly, fully and in good faith their respective 

commitments under this agreement in order to address the root causes of conflict 

and put an end to recurring cycles of violence, and promote lasting regional 

development, 

 Encouraging the continuation of efforts by the Secretary-General of the United 

Nations, the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), the 

Southern African Development Community (SADC), and the African Union (AU) to 

restore peace and security in eastern DRC, encouraging the government of the DRC

eastern DRC due to ongoing destabilizing activities of foreign and domestic armed 

groups, and stressing the importance of neutralizing the Democratic Forces for the 

Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), the Lord’s 

Resistance Army (LRA), the National Liberation Forces (FNL), and all other armed 

groups in the DRC, and recognizing the efforts of the FARDC against armed groups, 

especially the ADF,

stability to and protecting civilians of the DRC and the Great Lakes region, noting 

with deep concern repeated reports of collaboration between elements of the 

Congolese Armed Forces (FARDC) and elements of the FDLR at a local level and 

unfettered regional travel by FDLR, recalling that the FDLR is a group under UN 

sanctions whose leaders and members include perpetrators of the 1994 genocide 

against the Tutsi in Rwanda, during which Hutu and others who opposed the 

genocide were also killed, and have continued to promote and commit ethnical ly-

based and other killings in Rwanda and the DRC,

by the various Congolese and foreign armed groups active in the region, and calling 

upon the DRC and all States in the region to work towards the peaceful environment 

conducive to the realization of durable solutions for refugees and internally 

displaced persons, including their eventual voluntary return and reintegration in the 

DRC, with the support, as appropriate, of the UN country team, supporting 

UNHCR’s current efforts to complete biometric registration of the Rwandese 

refugee population in the DRC to help facilitate the return of these refugees to 

Rwanda, and calling upon all parties in the conflict to respect the impartiality, 

independence and neutrality of humanitarian actors,  

 Remaining deeply concerned by the persistent high levels of violence and 

violations and abuses of human rights and international law, condemning in 

particular those involving the targeted attacks against civilians, widespread sexual 

and gender-based violence, systematic recruitment and use of children by certain 

parties to the conflict, the displacement of significant numbers of civilians, 

extrajudicial executions and arbitrary arrests, recognizing their deleterious effect on 

the stabilization, reconstruction and development efforts in the DRC, and calling for 

all those responsible for all such violations and abuses to be swiftly apprehended, 

brought to justice and held accountable,

children and armed conflicts, and on the protection of civilians in armed conflicts,
