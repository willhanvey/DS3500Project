Agenda item 100 (u)  

General and complete disarmament: problems arising 

from the accumulation of conventional ammunition 

stockpiles in surplus

  Problems arising from the accumulation of conventional 

ammunition stockpiles in surplus 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Mindful of the dangers posed by unplanned explosions at munitions sites and 

the diversion of materials from conventional ammunition stockpiles to the illicit 

market, including for the manufacture of improvised explosive devices,  

 Emphasizing that thousands of people have died and the livelihoods of entire 

communities have been disrupted as a result of accidental ammunition depot 

explosions and that diversion from ammunition stockpiles has contributed to the 

intensity and duration of armed conflict and sustained armed violence around the 

world,1  

 Recognizing the need to encourage the full involvement of both women and men 

in ammunition management practice and policy,  

 Noting that conventional weapons and their ammunition are items for which, in 

principle, action can be taken to improve the regulation of transfers and prevent their 

diversion to illicit trafficking,  

 Recognizing the urgency of addressing the security and safety risks emanating 

from ineffective stockpile management around the world,2  

 Bearing in mind a through-life management approach to tackle problems related 

to ammunition in a comprehensive manner, including those related to diversion,

political missions, 

 Recognizing the importance of appropriate national ammunition management 

structures and procedures, including laws and regulations, training and doctrine,

 1. Encourages all interested States to assess, on a voluntary basis, whether, 

in conformity with their legitimate security needs, parts of their stockpiles of 

conventional ammunition should be considered to be in surplus, and recognizes that 

the security of such stockpiles must be taken into consideration and that appropriate 

controls with regard to the security and safety of stockpiles of conventional 

ammunition are indispensable at the national level in order to eliminate the risk of 

explosion, pollution or diversion;  

 2. Appeals to all interested States to determine the size and nature of their 

surplus stockpiles of conventional ammunition, whether they represent a security or 

safety risk, their preferred means of destruction, if appropriate, and whether external 

assistance is needed to eliminate this risk; 

 3. Encourages States in a position to do so to assist interested States within 

a bilateral framework or through international or regional organizations, including 

through activities conducted under the umbrella of the SaferGuard knowledge 

resource management programme, on a voluntary and transparent basis, in elaborating 

and implementing programmes to eliminate surplus stockpiles or to improve stockpile 

management; 

 4. Encourages all Member States to examine the possibility of developing 

and implementing, within a national, regional or subregional framework, measures to 

address accordingly the illicit trafficking related to the accumulation of such

support to the mechanism; 

 10. Encourages States wishing to improve their national ammunition stockpile

programme, as well as potential national donors, regional organizations or other 

organizations, as appropriate; 

 11. Encourages States, as appropriate, to consider ammunition management 

as an intrinsic part of their actions for achieving relevant targets of the Sustainable 

Development Goals related to the reduction of illicit arms flows and the p revention 

of violence through strengthened national institutions, and to consider, where 

relevant, developing national, regional and subregional indicators based on this 

understanding;
