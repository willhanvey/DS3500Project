 Taking into account the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the 
International Court of Justice on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a 
Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,5 and recalling in this regard General 
Assembly resolution ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004,  

 Convinced that occupation itself represents a gross and grave violation of 
human rights,  

 Gravely concerned about the continuing detrimental impact of the events that 
have taken place since 28 September 2000, including the excessive use of force by 
the Israeli occupying forces against Palestinian civilians, resulting in thousands of 
deaths and injuries, the widespread destruction of property and vital infrastructure, 
the internal displacement of civilians, the imposition of collective punishment 
measures, particularly against the civilian population in the Gaza Strip, and the 
detention and imprisonment of thousands of Palestinians, 

 Gravely concerned in particular by reports regarding serious human rights 
violations and grave breaches of international humanitarian law committed during 
the military operations in the Gaza Strip between December 2008 and January 2009, 
including the findings in the summary by the Secretary-General of the report of the 
Board of Inquiry6 and in the report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on 
the Gaza Conflict,7 and stressing the necessity for serious follow-up by all parties of 
the recommendations addressed to them towards ensuring accountability and justice,  

 Having considered the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli 
Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of 
the Occupied Territories8 and the relevant reports of the Secretary-General,9  

 Recalling the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government 
Arrangements of 13 September 199310 and the subsequent implementation 
agreements between the Palestinian and Israeli sides,  

 Stressing the urgency of bringing a complete end to the Israeli occupation that 
began in 1967 and thus an end to the violation of the human rights of the Palestinian 
people, and recalling in this regard its resolution 58/292 of 6 May 2004,  

 1. Commends the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices 
Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the 
Occupied Territories for its efforts in performing the tasks assigned to it by the 
General Assembly and for its impartiality;  

 2. Reiterates its demand that Israel, the occupying Power, cooperate, in 
accordance with its obligations as a State Member of the United Nations, with the 
Special Committee in implementing its mandate;  

 3. Deplores those policies and practices of Israel that violate the human 
rights of the Palestinian people and other Arabs of the occupied territories, as 
reflected in the report of the Special Committee covering the reporting period;8

 4. Expresses grave concern about the critical situation in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, particularly in the Gaza Strip, as a 
result of unlawful Israeli practices and measures, and especially condemns and calls 
for the immediate cessation of all illegal Israeli settlement activities and the 
construction of the wall, as well as the excessive and indiscriminate use of force 
against the civilian population, the destruction and confiscation of properties, 
measures of collective punishment, and the detention and imprisonment of 
thousands of civilians;  

 5. Requests the Special Committee, pending complete termination of the 
Israeli occupation, to continue to investigate Israeli policies and practices in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories 
occupied by Israel since 1967, especially Israeli violations of the Geneva 
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 
12 August 1949,1 and to consult, as appropriate, with the International Committee of 
the Red Cross according to its regulations in order to ensure that the welfare and 
human rights of the peoples of the occupied territories are safeguarded and to report 
to the Secretary-General as soon as possible and whenever the need arises 
thereafter;

General periodic reports on the current situation in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem;
