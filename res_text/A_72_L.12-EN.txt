 Noting that the Eleventh Ministerial Conference of the World Trade 

Organization will be held in Buenos Aires from 10 to 13 December 2017,  

 Concerned that only a limited number of States have taken measures to 

implement, individually and through regional fisheries management organizations 

and arrangements, the International Plan of Action for the Management of Fishing 

Capacity adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,  

 Recalling the International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate 

Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing adopted by the Food and Agriculture 

Organization of the United Nations,  

 Particularly concerned that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing 

continues to constitute a serious threat to fish stocks and marine habitats and 

ecosystems, to the detriment of sustainable fisheries as well as the food security and 

the economies of many States, particularly developing States,  

 Concerned that some operators increasingly take advantage of the 

globalization of fishery markets to trade fishery products stemming from illegal, 

unreported and unregulated fishing and make economic profits from tho se 

operations, which constitutes an incentive for them to pursue their activities,  

 Recognizing that effective deterrence and combating of illegal, unreported and 

unregulated fishing has significant financial and other resource implications for all 

States, in particular developing States,  

 Recognizing also that fishing by vessels without nationality on the high seas 

undermines relevant objectives of the Convention and the Agreement to conserve 

and sustainably manage marine resources, and noting with concern that fishing 

vessels without nationality operate on the high seas without governance and 

oversight,  

 Recognizing further the role of the Global Record of Fishing Vessels, 

Refrigerated Transport Vessels and Supply Vessels in the concerted fight against 

illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing,  

 Recognizing the duty provided in the Convention, the Agreement to Promote 

Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing 

Vessels on the High Seas (the Compliance Agreement),
6
 the Agreement and the 

Code for flag States to effectively exercise jurisdiction and control over fishing 

vessels flying their flag, and vessels flying their flag which provide support to 

fishing vessels, to ensure that the activities of such fishing and support  vessels do 

not undermine the effectiveness of conservation and management measures taken in 

accordance with international law and adopted at the national, subregional, regional 

or global levels, 

 Noting the advisory opinion of the International Tribunal for the Law of the 

Sea on the request for an advisory opinion submitted by the Subregional Fisheries 

Commission, issued on 2 April 2015, 

 Recognizing the importance of adequately regulating, monitoring and 

controlling trans-shipment at sea to contribute to combating illegal, unreported and 

unregulated fishing activities,  

 Noting the obligation of all States, in accordance with international law, as 

reflected in the relevant provisions of the Convention, to cooperate in the 

conservation and management of living marine resources, and recognizing the 

importance of coordination and cooperation at the global, regional, subregional and

national levels in the areas, inter alia, of marine scientific research, data collection, 

information-sharing, capacity-building and training for the conservation, management 

and sustainable development of living marine resources,  

 Acknowledging the importance of ocean data buoy systems moored in areas 

beyond national jurisdiction to sustainable development, promoting safety at sea an d 

limiting human vulnerability to natural disasters, due to their use in weather and 

marine forecasts, fisheries management, tsunami forecasts and climate prediction, 

and expressing concern that most damage to ocean data buoys, such as moored 

buoys and tsunameters, frequently results from actions taken by some fishing 

operations which render the buoys inoperable,  

 Welcoming in this regard the adoption of measures by States, individually or 

through regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements , to protect 

ocean data buoy systems from the impacts of fishing activities,  

 Encouraging States, individually or through regional fisheries management 

organizations and arrangements, to cooperate to ensure that interactions between 

fishing operations and ocean data buoys on the high seas are minimized,  

 Recognizing the need for States, individually and through regional fisheries 

management organizations and arrangements, to continue to develop and 

implement, consistent with international law, effective por t State measures to 

combat overfishing and illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, the critical need 

for cooperation with developing States to build their capacity, and the importance of 

cooperation between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the  United Nations 

and the International Maritime Organization in this regard,  

 Recalling the entry into force of the Agreement on Port State Measures to 

Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing of the 

Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
7
 in 2016,  

 Recognizing the efforts of States, individually and through regional fisheries 

management organizations and arrangements, to implement its resolution 46/215 of 

20 December 1991, in which the General Assembly called for a global moratorium 

on all large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing, including collaborative fisheries 

enforcement activities, 

 Concerned that marine pollution from all sources constitutes a serious threat  to 

human health and safety, endangers fish stocks, marine biodiversity and marine and 

coastal habitats and has significant costs to local and national economies,  

 Recognizing that marine debris is a global transboundary pollution problem 

and that, owing to the many different types and sources of marine debris, different 

approaches to its prevention and removal are necessary, including identification of 

such sources and environmentally sound techniques for its removal,  

 Recognizing also that the majority of marine debris, including plastics and 

microplastics, entering the seas and oceans is considered to originate from land -

based sources,  

 Recognizing further that abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear, 

including ghost fishing gear, is an increasingly pervasive and destructive form of 

marine debris causing adverse impacts on fish stocks, marine life and the marine 

environment and that urgent preventative action is needed, such as marking of 

fishing gear as proposed by the Committee on Fisheries, as well as removal action,

 Reaffirming the importance of sustainable aquaculture to food security, 

recognizing that aquaculture is already making a significant contribution to the 

global seafood supply and that a further increase in that contribution is  anticipated, 

 Noting that the contribution of sustainable aquaculture to global fish supplies 

continues to respond to opportunities in developing countries to enhance local food 

security and nutrition and poverty alleviation and, together with the efforts  of other 

aquaculture-producing countries, will make a significant contribution to meeting 

future demands in fish consumption, bearing in mind article 9 of the Code, 

 Noting in this regard the concern about the potential effects of genetically 

engineered aquatic fish species on the health and sustainability of wild fish stocks,  

 Recognizing the efforts made by States and regional fisheries management 

organizations and arrangements in regulating deep -sea fisheries, while still 

concerned that some deep-sea fishing activities in certain areas are being carried out 

without full implementation of relevant paragraphs of previous resolutions, 

representing a threat to vulnerable marine ecosystems,  

 Calling attention to the particular vulnerabilities of small island developing 

States, other developing coastal States and subsistence fishing communities whose 

livelihoods, economic development and food security are heavily dependent on 

sustainable fisheries and will suffer disproportionately if sustainable fisheries are 

negatively affected, 

 Calling attention also to the circumstances affecting fisheries in many 

developing States, in particular African States and small island developing States, 

and recognizing the urgent need for capacity-building, including the transfer of 

marine technology and in particular fisheries- and aquaculture-related technology, to 

enhance the ability of such States to exercise their rights in order to realize the 

benefits from fisheries resources and fulfil their obligations under international 

instruments, 

 Recognizing the need to adopt, implement and enforce appropriate measures to 

minimize waste, by-catch and discards, including high-grading, loss of fishing gear 

and other factors that adversely affect the sustainability of fish stocks and 

ecosystems and, consequently, can also have harmful effects on the economies and 

food security of small island developing States, other developing coastal States and 

subsistence fishing communities,  

 Recognizing also the need to adopt and implement appropriate measures, 

consistent with the best available scientific information, to minimize by -catch of 

non-targeted species and juveniles through the effective management of fishing 

methods, including the use and design of fish aggregating devices, in order to 

mitigate adverse effects on fish stocks and ecosystems,  

 Recognizing further the need to further integrate ecosystem approaches into 

fisheries conservation and management and, more generally, the importance of 

applying ecosystem approaches to the management of human activities in the ocean, 

and noting in this regard the Reykjavik Declaration on Responsible Fisheries in the 

Marine Ecosystem,
8
 the work of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 

United Nations related to guidelines for the implementation of the ecosystem 

approach to fisheries management and the importance of this approach to relevant 

provisions of the Agreement and the Code, as well as decision VII/11
9
 and other 

relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biologic al

 Recognizing the economic and cultural importance of sharks in many 

countries, the biological importance of sharks in the marine ecosystem as key 

predatory species, the vulnerability of certain shark species to overexploitation, the 

fact that some are threatened with extinction, the need for measures to promote the 

long-term conservation, management and sustainable use of shark populations and 

fisheries, and the relevance of the International Plan of Action for the Conservation 

and Management of Sharks, adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of 

the United Nations in 1999, in providing guidance on the development of such 

measures, 

 Welcoming in this regard the review by the Food and Agriculture Organization 

of the United Nations of the implementation of the International Plan of Action for 

the Conservation and Management of Sharks, and its ongoing work in this regard,  

 Noting with concern that basic data on shark stocks and harvests continue to 

be lacking and that not all regional fisheries management organizations and 

arrangements have adopted conservation and management measures for directed 

shark fisheries and for the regulation of by-catch of sharks from other fisheries,  

 Welcoming science-based measures taken by States to conserve and 

sustainably manage sharks, and noting in this respect management measures taken 

by coastal States, including limits on catch or fishing effort, technical measures, 

including by-catch reduction measures, sanctuaries, closed seasons and areas and 

monitoring, control and surveillance, 

 Recalling the decisions on sharks and rays adopted at the seventeenth meeting 

of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in 

Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, held in Johannesburg, South Africa, 

from 24 September to 5 October 2016, inter alia, the inclusion of additional species 

of sharks and rays in appendix II to that Convention,
10

 and recalling also the 

ongoing work of the secretariat of that Convention, the Indian Ocean Tuna 

Commission, the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center and the Food and 

Agriculture Organization of the United Nations on capacity-building in this regard,  

 Noting that the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the 

Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, at its twelfth session, held in 

Manila from 23 to 28 October 2017, added 5 new species of sharks and rays to those 

listed in the appendices to that Convention,
11

 bringing the number to 34 species,  

 Noting with concern the continuing practice of the removal of fins from 

sharks, with the remainder of the carcass being discarded at sea,  

 Recognizing the importance of marine species occupying low trophic levels in 

the ecosystem and for food security, and the need to ensure their long -term 

sustainability, 

 Expressing concern over continued incidental mortality, in fishing operations, 

of seabirds, particularly albatrosses and petrels, as well as other marine species, 

including sharks, fin-fish species, marine mammals and marine turtles, while 

recognizing considerable efforts by States and through various regional fisheries 

management organizations and arrangements to reduce incidental mortality as a 

result of by-catch, 

 Noting with concern the significant threat that invasive alien species, such as  

those carried and transferred by ballast water and by biofouling on ships, pose to

Achieving sustainable fisheries 

 1. Reaffirms the importance it attaches to the long-term conservation, 

management and sustainable use of the living marine resources of the world’s 

oceans and seas and the obligations of States to cooperate to this end, in accordance 

with international law, as reflected in the relevant provisions of the Convention,
1
 in 

particular the provisions on cooperation set out in Part V and Part VII, section 2, of 

the Convention, and where applicable, the Agreement;
2
  

 2. Calls upon all States that have not done so, in order to achieve the goal 

of universal participation, to become parties to the Convention, which set s out the 

legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried 

out, taking into account the relationship between the Convention and the 

Agreement; 

 3. Notes with satisfaction that, in “The future we want”,
3
 States addressed 

the sustainable development of fisheries, recognized the significant contribution of 

fisheries to the three dimensions of sustainable development and stressed the crucial 

role of healthy marine ecosystems, sustainable fisheries and sustainable aquaculture 

for food security and nutrition and in providing for the livelihoods of millions of 

people, and encourages States to implement the commitments made in “The future 

we want”; 

 4. Calls upon States to implement the Sustainable Development Goals 

outlined in the outcome document of the United Nations summit for the adoption of 

the post 2015 development agenda, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 

Agenda for Sustainable Development”, as adopted by the General Assembly in its 

resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, including Goal 14 to conserve and 

sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development, 

and recalls that the Goals and targets are integrated and indivisible;  

 5. Reiterates, in this regard, the call for action to be taken on an urgent 

basis to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for 

sustainable development made in the declaration “Our ocean, our future: call for 

action”;
12

  

 6. Encourages States to give due priority to the implementation of the Plan 

of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Johannesburg 

Plan of Implementation)
13

 in relation to achieving sustainable fisheries, especially 

restoring depleted stocks to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield on 

an urgent basis and, where possible, not later than 2015, and recalls that, in “The 

future we want”, States committed themselves to intensify their efforts to meet that 

target and to urgently take the measures necessary to maintain or restore all stocks 

at least to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield, with the aim of 

achieving those goals in the shortest time feasible, as determined by their biological 

characteristics, and in order to achieve this, to urgently develop and implement 

science-based management plans, including by reducing or suspending fishing catch 

and fishing effort commensurate with the status of the stock, consistent with 

international law, the applicable international instruments and relevant General 

Assembly resolutions and guidelines of the Food and Agriculture Organization of 

the United Nations;

their illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities;  

 76. Urges States to take effective measures, at the national, subregional, 

regional and global levels, to deter the activities, including illegal, unreported and 

unregulated fishing, of any vessel which undermines conservation and management 

measures that have been adopted by subregional and regional fisheries management 

organizations and arrangements in accordance with international law;  

 77. Calls upon States not to permit vessels flying their flag to engage in 

fishing on the high seas or in areas under the national jurisdiction of other S tates, 

unless duly authorized by the authorities of the States concerned and in accordance 

with the conditions set out in the authorization, and to take specific measures, 

including deterring the reflagging of vessels by their nationals, in accordance with  

the relevant provisions of the Convention, the Agreement and the Compliance 

Agreement, to control fishing operations by vessels flying their flag;  

 78. Urges States, individually and collectively through regional fisheries 

management organizations and arrangements, to develop appropriate processes to 

assess the performance of States with respect to implementing the obligations 

regarding fishing vessels flying their flag set out in relevant international 

instruments; 

 79. Reaffirms the need to strengthen, where necessary, the international legal 

framework for intergovernmental cooperation, in particular at the subregional and 

regional levels, in the management of fish stocks and in combating illegal, unreported  

and unregulated fishing, in a manner consistent with international law, and for 

States and entities referred to in the Convention and in article 1, paragraph 2 ( b), of 

the Agreement to collaborate in efforts to address these types of fishing activities;  

 80. Urges regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements to 

further coordinate measures for combating illegal, unreported and unregulated 

fishing activities, such as through the development of a common list of vessels 

identified as engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing or  the mutual 



A/72/L.12 
 

 

17-20772 18/39 

 

recognition of the illegal, unreported and unregulated vessel lists established by 

each organization or arrangement; 

 81. Reaffirms its call upon States to take all necessary measures consistent 

with international law, without prejudice to a State’s sovereignty over ports in its 

territory and to reasons of force majeure or distress, including the prohibition of 

vessels from accessing their ports followed by a report to the flag State concerned, 

when there is clear evidence that they are or have been engaged in or have 

supported illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, or when they refuse to give 

information either on the origin of the catch or on the authorization under which the 

catch has been made; 

 82. Reaffirms paragraph 53 of its resolution 64/72 with regard to eliminating 

illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing by vessels flying “flags of convenience” 

and requiring that a “genuine link” be established between States and fishing vessels 

flying their flags, and urges States operating open registry to effectively control all 

fishing vessels flying their flag, as required by international law, or otherwise stop 

open registry for fishing vessels; 

 83. Notes the challenges posed by vessels determined under international law 

to be without nationality that are fishing on the high seas and that such vessels are 

engaging in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities as defined under 

the International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported 

and Unregulated Fishing of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 

Nations, and encourages States to take necessary measures where appropriate, 

consistent with international law, including enacting domestic legisla tion, in order 

to prevent and deter vessels without nationality from engaging in or supporting 

illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing;  

 84. Encourages States, either directly or through competent and appropriate 

subregional, regional or global organizations and arrangements, to consider 

adopting rules, consistent with international law, to ensure that chartering 

arrangements and practices related to fishing vessels enable compliance with and 

enforcement of relevant conservation and management measures, so as not to 

undermine efforts to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing;  

 85. Recognizes the need for enhanced port State measures to combat illegal, 

unreported and unregulated fishing, and urges States to cooperate, in particular at 

the regional level and through subregional and regional fisheries management 

organizations and arrangements, to adopt all necessary port measures, consistent 

with international law taking into account article 23 of the Agreement, and to 

further promote the development and application of standards at the regional level;  

 86. Welcomes the recent accessions to the Agreement on Port State Measures 

to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing,
7
 and 

encourages States and regional economic integration organizations that have not yet 

done so to consider ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to that Agreement;  

 87. Acknowledges, in this regard, the convening of the first meeting of the 

parties to the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate 

Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, held in Oslo from 29 to 31 May 2017, 

which, inter alia, established an open-ended technical working group to provide 

guidance on elaborating information exchange mechanisms and other  technical 

matters and also established an ad hoc working group under Part 6 of the Agreement 

and approved its terms of reference;  

 88. Notes the capacity development programme of the Food and Agriculture 

Organization of the United Nations aimed at facili tating and supporting the

Organization of the United Nations and the International Maritime Organization, 

taking into account the respective competencies, mandates and experience of the 

two organizations, to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, 

particularly in improving the implementation of flag State responsibilities and port 

State measures; 

 91. Also encourages States, with respect to vessels flying their flag, and port 

States, to make every effort to share data on landings and catch quotas, and in this 

regard encourages regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements to 

consider developing open databases containing such data for the purpose of 

enhancing the effectiveness of fisheries management;  

 92. Calls upon States to take all measures necessary to ensure that vessels 

flying their flag do not engage in trans-shipment of fish caught by fishing vessels 

engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, through adequate regulation, 

monitoring and control of trans-shipment of fish at sea, including through additional 

national measures applicable to vessels flying their flag to prevent such 

trans-shipment; 

 93. Urges States, individually and through regional fisheries management 

organizations and arrangements, to adopt and implement internationally agreed 

market-related measures in accordance with international law, including principles,

 97. Notes the concern expressed by the Committee on Fisheries at the 

proliferation of private standards and ecolabelling schemes potentially leading to 

the creation of trade barriers and restrictions, and also notes the work by the Food 

and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to develop an evaluation 

framework to assess the conformity of public and private ecolabelling schemes 

through the Guidelines for the Ecolabelling of Fish and Fishery Products from 

Marine Capture Fisheries; 

 98. Also notes the concerns about possible connections between transnational 

organized crime and illegal fishing in certain regions of the world, and encourages 

States, including through the appropriate international forums and organizations, to 

study the causes and methods of and contributing factors to illegal fishing to 

increase knowledge and understanding of those possible connections, and to make 

the findings publicly available, and in this regard takes note of the study issued by 

the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime on transnational organized  crime in 

the fishing industry, bearing in mind the distinct legal regimes and remedies under 

international law applicable to illegal fishing and transnational organized crime;  

 

V 

Monitoring, control and surveillance  

and compliance and enforcement 
 

 99. Calls upon States, in accordance with international law, to strengthen 

implementation of or, where they do not exist, adopt comprehensive monitoring, 

control and surveillance measures and compliance and enforcement schemes 

individually and within those regional fisheries management organizations or 

arrangements in which they participate, in order to provide an appropriate 

framework for promoting compliance with agreed conservation and management 

measures, and further urges enhanced coordination among all relevant States and 

regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements in these efforts;  

 100. Welcomes the fact that the Committee on Fisheries has urged its members 

to start implementing the Voluntary Guidelines for Flag State Performance
21

 as soon 

as possible, and urges all flag States to implement those Guidelines as soon as 

possible, including, as a first step, by carrying out a voluntary assessment;  

 101. Encourages further work by competent international organizations, 

including subregional and regional fisheries management organizations and 

arrangements, to develop guidelines on flag State control of fishing vessels;  

 102. Urges States, individually and through relevant regional fisheries 

management organizations and arrangements, to establish mandatory vessel 

monitoring, control and surveillance systems, in particular to require that vessel 

monitoring systems be carried by all vessels fishing on the high seas as soon as 

practicable, recalling that in paragraph 62 of resolution 63/112 of 5 December 2008 

it urged that large-scale fishing vessels be required to carry vessel monitoring 

systems no later than December 2008, and to share information on fisheries 

enforcement matters; 

 103. Calls upon States, individually and through regional fisheries 

management organizations or arrangements, to strengthen or establish, consistent 

with national and international law, positive or negative lists of vessels fishing

States as set out in article 25 of the Agreement; 

 104. Encourages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 

Nations, in cooperation with States, regional economic integration organizations, 

the International Maritime Organization and, as appropriate, regional fisheries 

management organizations and arrangements, to expedite efforts to develop and 

manage a comprehensive global record of fishing vessels, refrigerated transport 

vessels and supply vessels, including with a unique vessel identifier system, using, 

as a first step, the International Maritime Organization Ship Identification Number 

Scheme for fishing vessels of 100 gross tonnage and above, adopted by the 

Assembly of the International Maritime Organization in its resolution A.1078 (28) 

of 4 December 2013; 

 105. Welcomes the continued development of the Global Record of Fishing 

Vessels, Refrigerated Transport Vessels and Supply Vessels by the Food and 

Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, including its efforts to keep it cost -

effective, and encourages States, including through regional fisheries management 

organizations and arrangements, to provide the necessary data to the Global Record;  

 106. Also welcomes the agreement that the International Maritime 

Organization ship identification number should be used as the unique vessel 

identifier for phase I of the Global Record of Fishing Vessels, Refrigerated 

Transport Vessels and Supply Vessels and the fact that several regional fisheries 

management organizations and arrangements have made provisions for the 

International Maritime Organization number to be compulsory in their convention 

areas for all eligible vessels, and encourages those regional fisheries management 

organizations and arrangements which have not yet done so to do the same;  

 107. Requests States and relevant international bodies to develop, in 

accordance with international law, more effective measures to trace fish and fishery 

products to enable importing States to identify fish or fishery products caught in a 

manner that undermines international conservation and management measures 

agreed in accordance with international law, taking into account the special 

requirements of developing States and the forms of cooperation with developing 

States as set out in article 25 of the Agreement, and at the same time to recognize 

the importance of market access, in accordance with provisions 11.2.4, 11.2.5 and 

11.2.6 of the Code, for fish and fishery products caught in a manner that is in 

conformity with such international measures;  

 108. Requests States to take the necessary measures, consistent with 

international law, to help to prevent fish and fishery products caught in a manner 

that undermines applicable conservation and management measures adopted in 

accordance with international law from entering international trade;  

 109. Encourages States to establish and undertake cooperative surveillance 

and enforcement activities in accordance with international law to strengthen and 

enhance efforts to ensure compliance with conservation and management measures, 

and prevent and deter illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing;  

 110. Urges States, directly and through regional fisheries management 

organizations or arrangements, to develop and adopt effective monitoring, control 

and surveillance measures for trans-shipment, as appropriate, in particular at-sea 

trans-shipment, in order to, inter alia, monitor compliance, to collect and verify 

fisheries data, and to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and 

unregulated fishing activities, in accordance with international law and, in parallel, 



A/72/L.12 
 

 

17-20772 22/39 

 

to encourage and support the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 

Nations in studying the current practices of trans -shipment and produce a set of 

guidelines for this purpose; 

 111. Welcomes, in this regard, the global trans-shipment study which the Food 

and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is undertaking, encourages 

States to contribute to this work to ensure its completion as soon as possible, and 

also encourages further work by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 

United Nations to consider developing guidelines on this issue; 

 112. Expresses its appreciation for financial contributions from States to 

improve the capacity of the existing voluntary International Monitoring, Control and 

Surveillance Network for Fisheries-related Activities, and encourages States to join 

and actively participate in the Network and to consider supporting, when 

appropriate, its transformation in accordance with international law into an 

international unit with dedicated resources to further assist Network members, 

taking into account the forms of cooperation with developing States as set out in 

article 25 of the Agreement; 

 

VI 

Fishing overcapacity 
 

 113. Calls upon States to commit themselves to urgently reducing the capacity 

of the world’s fishing fleets to levels commensurate with the sustainability of fish 

stocks, through the establishment of target levels and plans or other appropriate 

mechanisms for ongoing capacity assessment, while avoiding the transfer of fishing 

capacity to other fisheries or areas in a manner that undermines the sustainable 

management of fish stocks, including those areas where fish stocks are 

overexploited or in a depleted condition, and recognizing in this context the 

legitimate rights of developing States to develop their fisheries for straddling fish 

stocks and highly migratory fish stocks consistent with article 25 of the Agreement, 

article 5 of the Code and paragraph 10 of the International Plan of Action for the 

Management of Fishing Capacity of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 

United Nations; 

 114. Calls upon, in this regard, States, individually or through regional 

fisheries management organizations and arrangements, to develop and implement a 

range of measures to adjust fishing intensity, including fishing capacity where 

relevant, to levels commensurate with the sustainability of fish stocks, and including 

capacity assessment and capacity management plans providing incentives for 

voluntary reduction, which take into account all aspects that contribute to fishing 

capacity, considering, inter alia, engine power, fishing gear technology, fish 

detection technology and storage space, and also to improve transparency on fishing 

capacity, including by identifying, sharing and publicizing relevant information in 

this regard, subject to confidentiality requirements; 

 115. Reiterates its call upon States, individually and through regional 

fisheries management organizations and arrangements, to ensure that the urgent 

actions required in the International Plan of Action for the Management of Fishing 

Capacity are undertaken expeditiously and that its implementation is facilitated 

without delay; 

 116. Invites the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to 

report on the state of progress in the implementation of the International Plan of 

Action for the Management of Fishing Capacity, as provided for in paragraph 48 of 

the Plan of Action; 



 A/72/L.12 

 

23/39 17-20772 

 

 117. Calls upon States, individually and, as appropriate, through subregional 

and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements with 

competence to regulate highly migratory species, urgently to address global fishing 

capacity for tunas, inter alia, in a way that recognizes the legitimate rights of 

developing States, in particular small island developing States, to participate in and 

benefit from such fisheries, taking into account the recommendations of the 2010 

Joint Tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations International Workshop 

on RFMO Management of Tuna Fisheries, held in Brisbane, Australia, and the 

recommendations of the 2011 third joint meeting of tuna regional fisheries 

management organizations and arrangements;  

 118. Encourages those States which are cooperating to establish subregional 

and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements, taking into 

account the best scientific information available as well as ecosystem approaches 

and the precautionary approach, to exercise voluntary restraint of fishing effort 

levels in those areas that will come under the regulation of the future organizations 

and arrangements until adequate regional conservation and management measures 

are adopted and implemented, taking into account the need to ensure the long -term 

conservation, management and sustainable use of the relevant fish stocks and to 

prevent significant adverse impacts on vulnerable marine ecosystems;  

 119. Recalls that, in “The future we want”, States reaffirmed their commitment  

in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation to eliminate subsidies that contribute to 

illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and overcapacity, taking into account the 

importance of that sector to developing countries, reiterated their commitment to 

conclude multilateral disciplines on fisheries subsidies that would give effect to the 

mandates of the World Trade Organization Doha Development Agenda
22

 and the 

Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration to strengthen disciplines on subsidies in the 

fisheries sector, including through the prohibition of certain forms of fisheries 

subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, recognizing that 

appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing and least 

developed countries should be an integral part of World Trade Organization fisheries 

subsidies negotiation, taking into account the importance of the sector to 

development priorities, poverty reduction and livelihood and food security concerns, 

and encouraged one another to further improve the transparency and reporting of 

existing fisheries subsidies programmes through the World Trade Organization and, 

given the state of fisheries resources, and without prejudicing the Doha and Hong 

Kong ministerial mandates on fisheries subsidies or the need to conclude those 

negotiations, to eliminate subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing 

and to refrain from introducing new such subsidies or from extending or enhancing 

existing ones; 

 120. Urges States to eliminate fisheries subsidies that contribute to 

overfishing and overcapacity and to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, 

including through accelerating work to complete negotiations on fisheries subsidies 

at the World Trade Organization, recognizing that appropriate and effective special 

and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an 

integral part of the World Trade Organization negotiations on fisheries subsidies;  

 

VII 

Large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing 
 

 121. Expresses concern that, despite the adoption of General Assembly 

resolution 46/215, the practice of large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing still exists and 

remains a threat to living marine resources;

 122. Urges States, individually and through regional fisheries management 

organizations and arrangements, to adopt effective measures, or strengthen existing 

measures, to implement and enforce the provisions of resolution 46/215 and 

subsequent resolutions on large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing in order to eliminate 

the use of large-scale pelagic drift nets in all seas and oceans, which means that 

efforts to implement resolution 46/215 should not result in the transfer to other parts 

of the world of drift nets that contravene the resolution;  

 123. Also urges States, individually and through regional fisheries 

management organizations and arrangements, to adopt effective measures, or 

strengthen existing measures, to implement and enforce the present global 

moratorium on the use of large-scale pelagic drift nets on the high seas, and calls 

upon States to ensure that vessels flying their flag that are duly authorized to use 

large-scale drift nets in waters under their national jurisdiction do not use such gear 

for fishing while on the high seas;  

 

VIII 

Fisheries by-catch and discards 
 

 124. Urges States, subregional and regional fisheries management organizations  

and arrangements and other relevant international organizations that have not done 

so to take action, including with consideration of the interests of developing coastal 

States and, as appropriate, subsistence fishing communities, to minimize by -catch, 

as well as to reduce or eliminate catch by lost or abandoned gear, fish discards and 

post-harvest losses, including of juvenile fish, consistent with international law and 

relevant international instruments, including the Code, and in particular to consider 

measures including, as appropriate, technical measures related to fish size, mesh 

size or gear, discards, closed seasons and areas and zones reserved for selected 

fisheries, particularly artisanal fisheries, the establishment of mechanisms for 

communicating information on areas of high concentration of juvenile fish, taking 

into account the importance of ensuring the confidentiality of such information, and 

support for studies and research that will minimize by-catch of juvenile fish, and to 

ensure that these measures are implemented so as to optimize their effectiveness;  

 125. Encourages in this regard States, individually or through regional 

fisheries management organizations and arrangements, as appropriate, to ensure 

proper implementation and enforcement of the measures they have taken with 

regard to by-catch and discards; 

 126. Welcomes the commitment of States in “The future we want” to enhance 

action to manage by-catch, discards and other adverse ecosystem impacts from 

fisheries, including by eliminating destructive fishing practices, consistent with 

international law, the applicable international instruments and relevant General 

Assembly resolutions and guidelines of the Food and Agriculture Organization of 

the United Nations; 

 127. Calls upon States, either individually, collectively or through regional 

fisheries management organizations and arrangements, to further study, develop and 

adopt effective management measures, taking into account the best available 

scientific information on fishing methods, including fish aggregating devices, to 

minimize by-catch; 

 128. Also calls upon States, either individually, collectively or through 

regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements, to collect the 

necessary data in order to evaluate and closely monitor the use of large -scale fish 

aggregating devices and other devices, as appropriate, and their effects on tuna 

resources and tuna behaviour and associated and dependent species, to improve 

management procedures to monitor the number, type and use of such devices and to

mitigate possible negative effects on the ecosystem, including on juveniles and the 

incidental by-catch of non-target species, particularly sharks and turtles, and notes 

in this regard the measures adopted by different regional fisheries management 

organizations and arrangements; 

 129. Notes in this regard that some regional fisheries management 

organizations, including the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, the 

International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, the Indian Ocean 

Tuna Commission and the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, have 

established their own working groups to assess the use and impact of large -scale 

fish aggregating devices, and also notes in this regard the convening of the first 

meeting of the Joint Tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations Fish 

Aggregating Devices Working Group, held in Madrid from 19 to 21 April 2017 in 

the framework of the Kobe process, with the aim of promoting discussions and 

coordinated actions in key areas relating to the management of fish aggregating 

devices in tuna fisheries from an ocean-wide perspective;  

 130. Encourages States, individually or through regional fisheries management 

organizations and arrangements, to promote, as appropriate, the use of 

environmentally friendly fish aggregating devices while ensuring compliance with 

measures that they have taken relating to such devices;  

 131. Urgently calls upon States, subregional and regional fisheries management 

organizations and arrangements and, where appropriate, other relevant international 

organizations to develop and implement effective management measures to reduce 

the incidence of catch and discards of non-target species, including the utilization of 

selective fishing gear, where appropriate, and to take appropriate measures to 

minimize waste, and welcomes in this regard the support of the Committee on 

Fisheries for the development of a technical guideline of the Food and Agriculture 

Organization of the United Nations addressing the causes of and remedies to food 

losses and waste; 

 132. Calls upon States and subregional and regional fisheries management 

organizations and arrangements to adopt or improve measures to assess the impact 

of their fisheries on species caught as by-catch and to improve the 

comprehensiveness and accuracy of information and reporting on incidental catch of 

species caught as by-catch, including through adequate observer coverage and the 

use of modern technologies, such as electronic monitoring, and to provide assistance 

to developing States to meet data-collection and reporting obligations;  

 133. Requests States and regional fisheries management organizations and 

arrangements, as appropriate, to strengthen or establish data-collection programmes

 183. Welcomes the important progress made by States, regional fisheries 

management organizations and arrangements and those States participating in 

negotiations to establish a regional fisheries management organization or arrangement  

competent to regulate bottom fisheries to implement paragraphs 80 and 83 to 87 of 

resolution 61/105, paragraphs 113, 117 and 119 to 124 of resolution 64/72 and 

paragraphs 121, 126, 129, 130 and 132 to 134 of resolution 66/68 and address the 

impacts of bottom fishing on vulnerable marine ecosystems, but notes with concern 

the uneven implementation of those provisions and that, in particular, bottom 

fishing continues to occur in certain areas beyond national jurisdiction without an 

impact assessment having been completed in the 10 years since the adoption of 

resolution 61/105, in which the General Assembly called for such assessments to be 

undertaken by 31 December 2008; 

 184. Calls upon, in this regard, States, regional fisheries management 

organizations and arrangements with the competence to regulate deep -sea fisheries, 

and States participating in negotiations to establish such organizations or 

arrangements to take, in particular, the following urgent actions regarding bottom 

fishing in areas beyond national jurisdiction:  

 (a) To use, as applicable, the full set of criteria in the Guidelines to identify 

where vulnerable marine ecosystems occur or are likely to occur as well as for 

assessing significant adverse impacts; 

 (b) To ensure that impact assessments, including for cumulative impacts of 

activities covered by the assessment, are conducted consistent with the Guidelines, 

particularly paragraph 47 thereof, are reviewed periodically and are revised 

thereafter whenever a substantial change in the fishery has occurred or there is 

relevant new information, and that, where such impact assessments have not been 

undertaken, they are carried out as a priority before authorizing bottom fishing 

activities; 

 (c) To ensure that conservation and management measures adopted by States 

and regional fisheries organizations and arrangements are based on and updated on 

the basis of the best available scientific information, noting in particular the need to 

improve effective implementation of thresholds and move-on rules; 

 185. Recognizes that different types of marine scientific research, such as, 

inter alia, seabed mapping, mapping of vulnerable marine ecosystems based on 

information from the fishing fleet, on-site camera observations from remote vehicles, 

benthic ecosystem modelling, comparative benthic studies and predictive modelling 

have resulted in identification of areas where vulnerable marine ecosystems are known 

or are likely to occur and in the adoption of conservation and management measures to 

prevent significant adverse impacts on such ecosystems, including the closure of areas 

to bottom fishing in accordance with paragraph 119 (b) of resolution 64/72;
