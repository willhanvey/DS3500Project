12 March (2012), 2095 of 14 March (2013), and 2144 (2014), as well as the 
Statement of its President (S/PRST/2013/21) of 16 December 2013, 

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial 
integrity and national unity of Libya, 

 Recalling that international law, as reflected in the United Nations Convention 
on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982, sets out the legal framework applicable 
to activities in the ocean, 

 Underlining the primary responsibility of the Libyan authorities in taking 
appropriate action to prevent the illicit export of crude oil from Libya, and 
reaffirming the importance of international support for Libyan sovereignty over its 
territory and resources,  

 Noting the letter of 10 March 2014 from the Libyan Government to the 
President of the Security Council and expressing concern that the illicit export of 
crude oil from Libya undermines the Government of Libya and poses a threat to the 
peace, security and stability of Libya, 

 Expressing support to efforts by the Libyan government to resolve peacefully 
the disruptions of Libya’s energy exports and re-iterating that control of all facilities 
should be transferred back to the proper authorities, supporting the Libyan 
government’s intention to address border security issues, including the 
implementation of the Tripoli Action Plan, and noting the importance of the 
European Union Border Assistance Mission to Libya to strengthen Libyan border 
management, 

 Determining that the situation in Libya continues to constitute a threat to 
international peace and security,
