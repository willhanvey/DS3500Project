measures to protect the health, safety and well-being of people, and emphasizing the 

importance of providing health and other essential workers with the necessary 

protection and support, 

 Recognizing further the important role that civil society, including 

non-governmental organizations and women’s and community-based organizations, 

youth-led organizations and all other stakeholders such as volunteers and national 

human rights institutions where they exist, as well as the academic and scientific 

community and the private sector play in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic 

and its consequences,

countries, the most vulnerable countries and, in particular, African countries, least 

developed countries, landlocked developing countries, small island developing

attention to their concerns and specific challenges,

impact on women, older persons, youth and children, as well as the poor, vulnerable 

and marginalized segments of the population, and that responses to the COVID -19 

pandemic need to take into account multiple and intersecting forms of violence,

and violence in digital contexts, during confinement, are deepening already existing 

inequalities and risk reversing the progress in achieving gender equality and the 

empowerment of women and girls made in recent decades,

and global responses that are comprehensive, innovative, participatory, transparent,

people-centred, disability-inclusive, gender-sensitive, age-responsive, conflict-sensitive, 

prevention-oriented and fully respect human rights,

stigmatization, racism and xenophobia related to the pandemic, and stressing the need 

to counter them as part of the COVID-19 response, 

 Expressing concern about the spread of disinformation and propaganda, 

including on the Internet, which can be designed and implemented so as to mislead, 

to violate human rights, including the right to privacy and to freedom of expression, 

and to incite violence, hatred, discrimination or hostility, and emphasizing the 

important contribution of journalists and media workers in countering this trend,

exacerbate the adverse humanitarian impact of conflict situations, and supports the

mandates and supporting national authorities in their response to the COVID-19

including private and commercial creditors, to address risks of debt vulnerabilities, 

through existing channels, in developing countries due to the pandemic;

least developed countries; 

 38. Emphasizes that illicit financial flows, in particular those caused by tax

combating illicit financial flows and strengthening international cooperation and good 

practices on assets return and recovery, including by more effective measures to

action for building more sustainable, peaceful, just, equitable, inclusive and resilient 

societies where no one is left behind and to make sustainable long-term investments 

to eradicate poverty in all its forms, as well as address inequa lities and human rights

negative effects of the pandemic and address climate change and the environmental 

crisis in order to build a better future for all;  

 42. Recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic has tested the capacity of 

institutions, reaffirms its commitment to promote good governance at all levels and

emphasizes the need to support and invest in adaptation and action at all levels to 

enhance efforts to build resilience through, inter alia, disaster risk reduction, 

community empowerment and participation and the sustainable management of 

ecosystems and the protection and sustainable use of biodiversity, including wildlife, 

to reduce the likelihood of zoonotic infections and the impacts and costs of disasters;  

 47. Urges Member States to adopt a climate- and environment-sensitive 

approach to COVID-19 recovery efforts, including by aligning investments and 

domestic policies with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris 

Agreement7 and the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention 

on Climate Change,30 reversing biodiversity loss, and strengthening approaches that 

reduce emissions and enhance both resilience and efficiency, such as increasing the 

global share of renewable energy, promoting pathways towards climate-resilient 

development, developing more ambitious national plans and, for parties to the Pa ris 

Agreement, communicating or updating their nationally determined contributions in 

2020, immediately curbing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving sustainable 

consumption and production patterns, taking climate change and biodiversity into
