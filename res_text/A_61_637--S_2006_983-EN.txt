Letter dated 13 December 2006 from the Permanent Representative 
of Azerbaijan to the United Nations addressed to the 
Secretary-General 

In my capacity as Chairman of the Organization of the Islamic Conference 
(OIC) Group in New York, I have the honour to transmit herewith a press release 
dated 12 December 2006 from the OIC Secretary General (annex I), and another 
dated 13 December 2006 from the OIC General Secretariat (annex 11) concerning 
the so-called "constitutional referendum" held on 10 December 2006 in the 
occupied Nagorny-Karabakh region of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 

The Organization of the Islamic Conference rejects the outcome of the 
referendum, which was against international law and will undermine existing 
international efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement of the dispute. 

I should be grateful if the present letter and its annexes were urgently 
distributed as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda items 17 and 27, 
and of the Security Council.
