action resulting from those reviews, in this regard urges African States that have not 

yet done so to consider joining the Mechanism process by 2023, as envisaged in the 

first 10-year implementation plan of Agenda 2063, and encourages further 

strengthening of the Mechanism process for its efficient performance, and takes note 

of the decisions taken by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the 

African Union at its eleventh extraordinary session, held in Addis Ababa on 17 and 

18 November 2018, on the institutional reform of the African Peer Review 

Mechanism;

process, and invites the international community to support the efforts of African

action arising from the process;  

 30. Notes with concern that the preliminary data indicate that the net bilateral 

aid flows to Africa decreased by 4 per cent in 2018 compared with 2017 figures; 21  

 31. Reiterates that the fulfilment of all official development assistance 

commitments remains crucial, including the commitment by many developed 

countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income for official 

development assistance and 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of gross national income for official 

development assistance to least developed countries, is encouraged by those  few 

countries that have met or surpassed their commitment to 0.7 per cent of gross 

national income for official development assistance and the target of 0.15 to 0.20 per 

cent of gross national income for official development assistance to least developed 

countries, and urges all others to step up efforts to increase their official development 

assistance and to make additional concrete efforts towards official development 

assistance targets;  

 32. Notes with appreciation the aspirations embedded in Agenda 2063 of the 

African Union to lift huge sections of the population out of poverty, improve incomes 

and catalyse economic and social transformation, and recognizes the importance of 

the international community helping African countries to achieve such goals, 

especially in the rural areas of the African continent;  

 33. Considers that innovative mechanisms of financing can make a positive 

contribution towards assisting developing countries in mobilizing additional 

resources for financing for development on a voluntary basis and that such financing 

should supplement and not be a substitute for traditional sources of financing, and, 

while highlighting the considerable progress on innovative sources of financing for 

development achieved to date, stresses the importance of scaling up present initiatives 

and developing new mechanisms, as appropriate;  

 34. Notes with concern Africa’s disproportionately low share of the volume of 

international trade, which stands at approximately 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent of world 

merchandise exports and imports, respectively, and 1.9 per cent and 3.1 per cent of 

world service exports and imports, respectively, in 2018;  

 35. Expresses concern at the increased debt burden of some African countries, 

underlines the importance of debt crisis prevention and prudent debt management, 

calls for a comprehensive and sustainable solution to the external debt problems of 

African countries, including the challenge of undeclared or hidden debt, and 

recognizes the important role, on a case-by-case basis, of debt relief, including debt 

cancellation, as appropriate, the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, debt 

restructuring and any other mechanism;

countries, to support the efforts of African countries to promote and maintain

policies conducive to attracting domestic and foreign investment, for example by 

encouraging private financial flows and supporting small and medium-sized 

enterprises, especially those owned by women, to promote investment by their private 

sectors in Africa, to encourage and facilitate the development and transfer of

operational phase on 7 July 2019; 

 41. Reiterates the need for all countries and relevant multilateral institutions 

to continue efforts to enhance coherence in their trade policies towards African 

countries, and acknowledges the importance of efforts to fully integrate African 

countries into the multilateral trading system and to build their capacity to compete 

through such initiatives as Aid for Trade and, given the world economic and financial 

crisis, the provision of assistance to address the adjustment challenges of trade 

liberalization;  

 42. Also reiterates that we are setting out together on the path towards 

sustainable development, devoting ourselves collectively to the pursuit of global 

development and of “win-win” cooperation which can bring huge gains to all 

countries and all parts of the world;  

 43. Emphasizes the importance of facilitating the accession of developing

countries and their development partners, as well as other initiatives, emphasizes the 

importance of coordination in such initiatives on Africa and the need for their 

effective implementation, and in this regard recognizes the important role that North -

South, South-South and triangular cooperation can play in supporting Africa ’s 

development efforts, particularly the implementation of the New Partnership, while 

bearing in mind that South-South cooperation is not a substitute for but rather a 

complement to North-South cooperation;  

 46. Recognizes the importance and different history and particularities of 

South-South cooperation, reaffirms that South-South cooperation, as a manifestation 

of solidarity among peoples and countries of the South, contributes to their national 

well-being, their national and collective self-reliance and the attainment of 

internationally agreed development goals, including the Sustainable Development 

Goals, according to national priorities and plans, and that South-South cooperation 

and its agenda have to be set by countries of the South and should continue to be 

guided by the principles of respect for national sovereignty, national ownership and 

independence, equality, non-conditionality, non-interference in domestic affairs and 

mutual benefit, welcomes the increased contributions of South-South cooperation to
