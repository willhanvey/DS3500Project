I I I . RECOMMEYNDATIONS  OF THE FIRST COMMITTFE

9. The First Committee recommends to the Genera! Assembly the  adoption of the
followinq draft resolutions:

Cessation of all nuclear-test explosions

A

The General Assembly,

Bearing in mind that the complete cessation 0,:‘ nuclebi-weapon  tests,
which has been examined for more than  thirty years and on which the General
Assembly has adopted more than fifty resolutions, is a basic objective of the

to the attainment of which it hasUnited Nations in the sphere of disarmament,
repeatedly a8siqned the highest priority,

Stressinq  that on eight different occas
in the strongest terms and that, since 1974,
the continuance of nuclear-weapon testing wi
increasing the iger  of nuclear war,

ions it has condemned such tests
it has stated its conviction that

11. intensify the arms race, thus

Recallinq  that the Secretary-General, addressinq  a plenary meeting of the
General Assembly on 12 December 1984, / after appealing for a renewed effort
towards a comprehensive test-ban treaty, emphasized that no single
multilateral agreement could have a greater effect on limiting the further
refinement of nuclear weapons and that a c0mprehensi.e  test-ban treaty is the
litmus test of t.he  real willingness to pursue nuclear disarmament,

Taking into account that the three nuclear-weapon States which act as
depositaries of the 1963 Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the
Atmosphere, in Outer Space and-  under Water 5/ undertook in article 1 of ‘. hat
Treaty to conclude a treaty resulting in the  perlanent  banninq of all
nuclear-test explosions, including all those explosions underqround,  and that
such an undertaking was reiterated in 1968 in the preamble to the  Treaty on
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, 5/ articl?  VI of which further
embodies their solemn and legally bindinq  commitment to take effe..:t.ive
measures relating to cessation of the nuclear-arms race at an early date and
t o  n u c l e a r  dioarmament,

Bearinq  in mind that the same three nuolear-weapon States,  in the report
they submitted on 30 July 1980 to the Committee on Disarmament after four
year8 of trilateral negotiatione, stated, inter alia, that they were “mindful
Of the great value for all mankind that the prohibition of all nuolear-weapon
teat explosionA  in all environment8  will have” ae well a8 *oonecious  of the
impor  tent responsibility placed upon them to find eolutione to the remaining
pr obleme”  , adding furthermore that they were “determincd  to  exert their beet
efforts and neceseary  will and pereietenoe to bring the negotiations to an
early and euocesef ul conolusionW,  1/

Noting that the Third Review Conferenoe of the Parties to  the Treaty on
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, in its Final Declaration 8J adopted
On 21 September 1985, called on the nuclear-weapon State6  parties  to the
Treaty to r eaume  tr ilater  al negotiations in 1985 and on all the nuolear-weapon
States  to  part ic ipate  in the urgent  negotiat ion and conclusion of a
comprehensive nuclear-teat ban treaty, aa a matter of the higheet  priority, in
the Conference on Disarmament,

Recalling that the leaders  of the six  countr ies  aseociated  under the
five-continants peace and disarmament  initiative affirmed in the Mexico
Declaration, adopted on 7 Auguet 1986,  that they “remain convinced that no
issue is more urgent and or ucial  today than bringing to an end all nuclear
tet3tBa, adding that “both  the qualitative and the  quantitative development of
nuclear weapons exacerbate the arm6  race, and both would be inhibited by the
complete abolition of nuclear weapon8 testing”, 9J

Bearinq in mind that the multilateral negotiation of such a treaty in the
Conference on Disarmament must cover all the various interrelated problems
t.hat  i t  will be necessary to solve in  order  that the Conference may transmit a
complete draft treaty to the General Assembly,

1. Reiterate8  once again ite grave concern that nuclear-weapon testing
continues unabated, against the wiehes  of the overwhelming majority of Member
States;

2. ..eaffirme  it6 conviction that a

3. Reaffirms also its conviction that such a treaty would constitute a
contribution of the utmost importance to the cessation of the nuclear-arms
race;

4. Urges once more the three depositary Powers of the Treaty Banning
Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Xter  Space and under Water and of
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to abide atr ictly  by
their under takings to seek to achieve the early discontinuance of all test
explosions of nuclear weapons for all time and to expedite negotiations t.o
t h i s  endi

5. Appeals to all States members of the Conference on Disarmament, in
particular to the three depositary Powers of the Treaty BarrIling  Nuclear Weapon
Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water and of the Treaty on
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to promote the establishment by the
Conference at the beginning of its 1987 session of an ad hoc committee with
the objective of carrying out the multilateral negotiation of a treaty on the
complete cessation of nuclear-test explosions;

6. Recommends to the Conference on Disarmament that such an ad hoc

Recallinq  that in its resolution 2028 (xx; of 19 November 1965, adopted
unanirouely, it had stressed that one of the basic principles on which the
treaty to prevent  the proliferation of nuclear  weapons should be  based was
that such treaty, which was then to be negotiated, should embudy  an acceptable
balance of mutual responsibilities and oblig&tfons  of the nuclear and
non-nuclear Power 8,

Recalling also that  the Third Review Conference of the Parties to the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapone,  in its Final
Declaration t/  adopted by consensus on 21 September 1985, expressed its deep
regret that a comprehensive multilateral nuclear-teat-ban treaty h a d  n o t  b e e n
concluded so far and called for the urgent negotiation and conclusion of  such
a treaty as a matter of  the highest priority,

Noting  t h a t article II of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the
Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water provides a procedure for the
consideration and eventual adoption of amendments to the Treaty by a
conference of its  parties,

1. Recommends that the State:, ,?ar ties to the Treaty Banning Nuclear
Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water undertake
practical steps leading to the convening of a conference to consider
amendments to the Treaty that would convert it into a comprehensive
nuclear-test-ban treaty)

2. Requests that States parties to the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon
Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water report to the General
