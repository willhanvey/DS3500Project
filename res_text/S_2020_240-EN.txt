 The Security Council,  

 Recalling the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 

reaffirming the primary responsibility of the Security Council under the Charter of 

the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security,  

 Recalling its previous relevant resolutions and presidential statements 

addressing issues of peacekeeping, 

 Reaffirming the basic principles of peacekeeping, such as consent of the parties, 

impartiality, and non-use of force, except in self-defence and defence of the mandate,  

 Underscoring the importance of peacekeeping as one of the most effective tools 

available to the United Nations in the promotion and maintenance of international 

peace and security, and affirming that lasting peace is not achieved nor sustained by 

military and technical engagements alone, but through political solutions and strongly 

convinced that they should guide the design and deployment of United Nations 

peacekeeping operations,  

 Noting with appreciation the progress made in efforts undertaken by the 

Secretary-General to mobilize all partners and stakeholders in support of more 

effective United Nations peacekeeping through the Secretary-General’s “Action for 

Peacekeeping” initiative, which places high importance on the safety and security of 

peacekeepers alongside advancing political solutions, promoting the Women, Peace 

and Security agenda, strengthening protection of civilians, supporting effective 

performance and accountability, strengthening the impact of peacekeeping on 

peacebuilding and sustaining peace, improving peacekeeping partnerships, and 

strengthening the conduct of peacekeeping operations and personnel,  

 Expressing grave concern about the security threats and targeted attacks against 

United Nations peacekeepers in many peacekeeping missions, which constitute a 

major challenge to United Nations peacekeeping operations, including threats posed 

by landmines, explosive remnants of war and improvised explosive devices, recalling 

the sacrifices of uniformed and civilian personnel in implementing United Nations 



S/2020/240 
 

 

20-04805 2/4 

 

peacekeeping mandates in challenging environments, and condemning in the 

strongest terms killing of and all acts of violence against United Nations peacekeeping 

personnel, which may constitute war crimes, and paying tribute to all peacekeepers, 

police and military as well as civilian ones, who lost their life while serving with the 

United Nations, 

 Underscoring the importance it places on the safety and security of 

peacekeepers in the field and the need for the Secretary-General and Troop-and 

Police-Contributing Countries and Member States to work together to ensure that 

missions are adequately resourced and all peacekeepers in the field are willing, 

capable and equipped effectively and safely to implement their mandate,  

 Condemning violations of status-of-forces agreements by any party to those 

agreements, recognizing the grave risks such violations can present to the safety and 

security of peacekeepers and affirming that the entry of personnel or equipment into 

the country and freedom of movement within the mandate should not be hindered, 

 Taking note of the measures taken and efforts made by the Secretariat and 

Member States in preventing and addressing illnesses including infectious diseases, 

among peacekeepers,  

 Noting that caveats not declared and not formally accepted by the Secretariat 

may adversely limit mandate implementation, and stresses the importance of avoiding 

caveats that may impinge upon the operational effectiveness of the mission and risk 

the safety and security of peacekeepers, in particular in hostile environments,  

 Recalling the report on “Improving Security of United Nations Peacekeepers”, 

the related Action Plan on improving safety and security, stressing that deficiencies 

in training, equipment, capacity, leadership at all levels, performance and 

accountability, and medical capacity in the missions can increase risks to the safety 

and security of peacekeepers, including leading to increased risk of fatalities,  

 Recalling its resolution 2436 (2018), underscoring the link between 

performance and safety and security of uniformed and civilian peacekeeping 

personnel, and recognizing that institutionalizing a culture of performance in United 

Nations peacekeeping will contribute to better delivery of peacekeeping mandates, as 

well as lead to improvements in the safety and security of peacekeepers,  

 Reaffirming the importance of full, effective and meaningful participation of 

women in peacekeeping operations and the importance of conducting and integrating 

a gender analysis and gender assessments when considering the safety and security 

of personnel, 

 Recognizing that possible adverse effects of environmental deterioration may, 

in the long run, aggravate certain existing threats to the stability of some host states 

which are particularly vulnerable to these adverse effects and which may influence 

the safety and security of peacekeepers, while respecting the respective mandates of 

all United Nations bodies in this regard, 

 Recognizing the critical role of United Nations peacekeepers in the promotion 

and maintenance of international peace and security in accordance with the Charter 

of the United Nations, and that the primary responsibility for the safety and security 

of United Nations personnel and assets rests with the host state, recognizing further 

that efforts to enhance safety and improve security need to improve at all levels both 

at headquarters and in the field as a shared endeavour,  

 1. Stresses the importance of supporting United Nations peacekeeping 

operations, recognizes the crucial role peacekeeping plays in achieving conditions for 

stability and a lasting peace, and emphasizes the importance of enhancing the safety 

and security of peacekeepers;

peacekeepers as necessary;

 4. Notes that peacekeepers are deployed in deteriorating and complex 

political and security environments, and face asymmetrical and complex threats,

in specific operating contexts to enhance safety and security of peacekeepers and 

mission protection, including through the provision of adequate medical facilities and 

critical capabilities; 

 5. Requests the Secretary-General to continue to take all appropriate 

measures to enhance the safety and security of peacekeeping personnel, including by

personnel are deployed to provide the essential 10-1-2 response at all times, within 

the mission area and as close to deployment of Troop-and Police-Contributing 

Countries as possible through the life of the mission;  

 10. Requests the Secretary-General to review and ensure uniformity of United 

Nations standards on training and performance, thereby improving safety and security 

of peacekeepers, and calls upon Member States to take action to help enhance training 

for United Nations peacekeepers, including but not limited to countering improvised 

explosive devices, mitigating threats from improvised explosive devices, health, and 

basic first aid, with the support of the Secretariat as appropriate;

performance in UN peacekeeping, recalls its requests in its resolution 2378 (2017) 

and resolution 2436 (2018) that the Secretary-General ensure that performance data 

related to the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations is used to improve mission 

operations, including decisions such as those regarding deployment, remediation, 

repatriation and incentives, reaffirms its support for the development of a 

comprehensive and integrated performance policy framework that identifies clear 

standards of performance for evaluating all United Nations civilian and uniformed 

personnel working in and supporting peacekeeping operations that facilitates 

effective and full implementation of mandates, and includes comprehensive and 

objective methodologies based on clear and well-defined benchmarks to ensure 

accountability for underperformance and incentives and recognition for outstanding 

performance; 

 12. Calls on the United Nations to further operationalize the Light

Nations, and encourages Member States to engage with this mechanism, with the aim 

of improving training on safety and security;
