Programme, 

 Recalling the Sendai Declaration and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk 

Reduction 2015–2030, adopted at the Third United Nations World Conference on 

Disaster Risk Reduction and endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution

Framework is an understanding of disaster risk for prevention and mitigation and for 

the development and implementation of appropriate preparedness and effective 

response to disasters, which continue to undermine efforts to achieve sustainable 

development, 

 Acknowledging that, based on the notion of hazards as defined in the Hyogo 

Framework for Action 2005–2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and

to managing and mitigating the effects of sand and dust storms through the 

enhancement of early warning systems and the sharing of climate and weather 

information to forecast sand and dust storms, and affirming that resilient action to 

combat sand and dust storms requires a better understanding of the severe 

multidimensional impacts of sand and dust storms, including the deterioration of the 

health, well-being and livelihood of people, increased desertification and land 

degradation, deforestation, loss of biodiversity and land productivity, and their impact

cardiovascular disorders such as asthma, tracheitis, pneumonia, allergic rhinitis and 

silicosis, 

 Emphasizing the relevance of the efforts and cooperation of Member States at 

the regional and international levels to control and reduce the negative impacts of 

sand and dust storms on human settlements in vulnerable regions, taking note of the

and, among other factors, is a serious challenge to the sustainable development of all 

countries, including those affected by sand and dust storms, and emphasizes that, 

among other factors, climate change is an important potential contributor to future 

wind erosion and the risk of sand and dust storms, especially the occurrence of more 

extreme wind events and the movement towards drier climates, although reverse 

effects are possible; 

 9. Recognizes that sand and dust storms cause numerous human health 

problems in different regions around the world, especially in arid and semi-arid regions, 

and that there is a need to reinforce protective strategies to reduce the negative
