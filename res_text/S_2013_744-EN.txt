Britain and Northern Ireland and United States of America:  
draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Noting with concern that the situation in the Middle East is tense and is likely 
to remain so, unless and until a comprehensive settlement covering all aspects of the 
Middle East problem can be reached, 

 Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations 
Disengagement Observer Force of 3 December 2013 (S/2013/716), and also 
reaffirming its resolution 1308 (2000) of 17 July 2000, 

 Stressing that both parties must abide by the terms of the 1974 Disengagement 
of Forces Agreement between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic and scrupulously 
observe the ceasefire,  

 Concurring with the Secretary-General’s findings that the ongoing military 
activities conducted by any actor in the area of separation continue to have the 
potential to escalate tensions between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic, 
jeopardize the ceasefire between the two countries, and pose a risk to the local 
civilian population and United Nations personnel on the ground, 

 Expressing grave concern at all violations of the Disengagement of Forces 
Agreement,  

 Stressing that there should be no military forces in the area of separation other 
than those of UNDOF,  

 Strongly condemning the recent intense fighting in the area of separation and 
calling on all parties to the Syrian domestic conflict to cease military actions in the 
UNDOF area of operation, noting in particular the significant confrontations of  
12 and 16 September and of 1 to 4 October, and the increased use by elements of the 
Syrian opposition and other groups of improvised explosive devices in the UNDOF 
area of operation,  

 Strongly condemning the incidents threatening the safety and security of 
United Nations personnel in recent months, including fighting on 1 October in the 
vicinity of Khan Arnabeh that resulted in an injury to UNDOF personnel, the firing 
on UNDOF vehicles carrying mission personnel on 15 October and 5 November by 
the Syrian Arab Armed Forces in Al Samdaniyah village and in the vicinity of Jaba 
in the area of limitation, respectively, the firing on and detention of four UNDOF

personnel on 1 November by armed elements of the Syrian opposition in the vicinity 
of Mughur Al-Mir village in the area of limitation, and the firing on an UNDOF 
convoy on 28 November by armed elements of the Syrian opposition in the vicinity 
of Ruihinahin in the area of limitation that resulted in an injury to United Nations 
personnel, 

 Underscoring the need for UNDOF to have at its disposal all necessary means 
and resources to carry out its mandate safely and securely, and recalling that the 
theft of United Nations weapons and ammunition, vehicles and other assets, and the 
looting and destruction of United Nations facilities, are unacceptable,  

 Expressing its profound appreciation to UNDOF’s military and civilian 
personnel, including those from Observer Group Golan, for their service and 
continued contribution, in an increasingly challenging operating environment, 
underscoring the important contribution UNDOF’s continued presence makes to 
peace and security in the Middle East, welcoming steps taken to enhance the safety 
and security of UNDOF, including Observer Group Golan, personnel, and stressing 
the need for continued vigilance to ensure the safety and security of UNDOF and 
Observer Group Golan personnel, 

 1. Calls upon the parties concerned to implement immediately its resolution 
338 (1973) of 22 October 1973;  

 2. Stresses the obligation on both parties to scrupulously and fully respect 
the terms of the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement, calls on the parties to 
exercise maximum restraint and prevent any breaches of the ceasefire and the area 
of separation, and underscores that there should be no military activity of any kind 
in the area of separation, including military operations by the Syrian Arab Armed 
Forces; 

 3. Underlines that there should be no military activity of the armed 
opposition groups in the area of separation, and urges Member States to convey 
strongly to the Syrian armed opposition groups in UNDOF’s area of operation to 
halt all activities that endanger United Nations peacekeepers on the ground and to 
accord the United Nations personnel on the ground the freedom to carry out their 
mandate safely and securely; 

 4. Calls on all parties to cooperate fully with the operations of UNDOF, to 
respect its privileges and immunities and to ensure its freedom of movement, as well 
as the security of and unhindered and immediate access for the United Nations 
personnel carrying out their mandate, including the temporary use of an alternative 
port of entry and departure, as required, to ensure safe and secure troop rotation 
activities, in conformity with existing agreements, and welcomes prompt reporting 
by the Secretary-General to the Security Council and troop-contributing countries of 
any actions that impede UNDOF’s ability to fulfil its mandate;  

 5. Welcomes the efforts being undertaken by the United Nations 
Disengagement Observer Force to implement the Secretary-General’s zero-tolerance 
policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and to ensure full compliance of its 
personnel with the United Nations code of conduct, requests the Secretary-General 
to continue to take all necessary action in this regard and to keep the Security 
Council informed, and urges troop-contributing countries to take preventive and 
disciplinary action to ensure that such acts are properly investigated and punished in 
cases involving their personnel;

Observer Force for a period of six months, that is, until 30 June 2014, and requests

resources to fulfil the mandate, as well as to enhance the Force’s ability to do so in a 
safe and secure way; 

 7. Requests the Secretary-General to report every 90 days on developments
