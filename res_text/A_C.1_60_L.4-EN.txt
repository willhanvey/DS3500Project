Sixtieth session
First Committee
Agenda item 97 (l)
General and complete disarmament: towards a nuclear-
weapon-free world: accelerating the implementation of
nuclear disarmament commitments

Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden:
draft resolution

Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: accelerating the
implementation of nuclear disarmament commitments

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolutions 58/51 of 8 December 2003 and 59/75 of 3 December
2004,

Also recalling the decisions and resolution on the Middle East of the 1995
Review and Extension Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons1 and the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,2

Regretting the lack of any substantive outcome of the 2005 NPT Review
Conference, as well as the inability of the General Assembly, at its 2005 World
Summit, to reach agreement on matters relating to nuclear disarmament and nuclear
non-proliferation,

Bearing in mind that 2005 marks the sixtieth anniversary of the dropping of
atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and that humankind should never again
be exposed to such horrific devastation,

Expressing its grave concern at the danger to humanity posed by the
possibility that nuclear weapons could be used,

Noting the growing concern at the lack of implementation of binding
obligations and agreed steps towards nuclear disarmament,

A/C.1/60/L.4

Reaffirming that nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are
mutually reinforcing processes requiring urgent irreversible progress on both fronts,

Recalling the unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon States to
accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals, leading to nuclear
disarmament, in accordance with commitments made under article VI of the Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,3

Underlining the importance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons and its universality to achieve nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-
proliferation,

1. Reaffirms that the outcome of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties
to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons sets out the framework
for systematic and progressive efforts towards nuclear disarmament;

2. Calls upon the nuclear-weapon States to accelerate the implementation of
the practical steps towards nuclear disarmament that were agreed upon at the 2000
Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons,2 thereby contributing to a safer world for all;

3. Also calls upon all States to comply fully with commitments made
regarding nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation and not to act in any
way that may be detrimental to either cause or that may lead to a new nuclear arms
race;

4. Further calls upon all States parties to spare no efforts to achieve the
universality of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,3 and urges
India, Israel and Pakistan, which are not yet parties to the Treaty, to accede to it as
non-nuclear weapon States promptly and without conditions;

5. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-first session an
item entitled “Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: accelerating the
implementation of nuclear disarmament commitments” and to review the
implementation of the present resolution at that session.
