 Recognizing the work of Syrian and international civil society actors in 

documenting violations of international humanitarian law and violations and abuses 

of human rights law in the Syrian Arab Republic during the conflict,  

 Noting with concern the impunity for serious violations of international 

humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human rights law committed during 

the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, which has provided a fertile ground for 

further violations and abuses,  

 Recalling the statements made by the Secretary-General, the United Nations 

High Commissioner for Human Rights and the special procedures of the Human 

Rights Council that crimes against humanity and war crimes are likely to have been 

committed in the Syrian Arab Republic,  

 Noting the repeated encouragement by the Secretary-General and the High 

Commissioner for Human Rights for the Security Council to refer the situation in 

the Syrian Arab Republic to the International Criminal Court,  

 1. Emphasizes the need to ensure accountability for crimes involving 

violations of international law, in particular of international humanitarian law and 

international human rights law, some of which may constitute war crimes or crimes 

against humanity, committed in the Syrian Arab Republic s ince March 2011 through 

appropriate, fair and independent investigations and prosecutions at the domestic or 

international level, and stresses the need to pursue practical steps towards this goal 

to ensure justice for all victims and to contribute to the prevention of future 

violations; 

 2. Stresses the need for any political process aimed at resolving the crisis in 

the Syrian Arab Republic to ensure credible and comprehensive accountability for 

violations of international humanitarian law and human rights violations and abuses 

committed in the country in order to bring about reconciliation and sustainable 

peace;  

 3. Welcomes the efforts by States to investigate and prosecute crimes within 

their jurisdiction committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, in accordance with their 

national legislation and international law, and encourages other States to consider 

doing the same and to share relevant information to that end with other States;  

 4. Decides to establish the International, Impartial and Independent 

Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation and Prosecution of Those Responsible for 

the Most Serious Crimes under International Law Committed in the Syrian Arab 

Republic since March 2011 under the auspices of the United Nations to closely 

cooperate with the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian 

Arab Republic to collect, consolidate, preserve and analyse evidence of violations 

of international humanitarian law and human rights violations and abuses and to 

prepare files in order to facilitate and expedite fair and independent criminal 

proceedings, in accordance with international law standards, in national, regional or 

international courts or tribunals that have or may in the future have jurisdiction over 

these crimes, in accordance with international law; 

 5. Requests the Secretary-General, in this regard, to develop, within 20 

working days of the adoption of the present resolution, the terms of reference of the 

International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism, with the support of the Office 



 
A/71/L.48 

 

3/3 16-22462 

 

of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and also requests that 

the Secretary-General undertake, without delay, the steps, measures and 

arrangements necessary for the speedy establishment and full functioning of the 

International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism, initially funded by voluntary 

contributions, in coordination with the Independent International Commission of 

Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic and building on existing capacities, including 

recruiting or allocating impartial and experienced staff with relevant skills and 

expertise in accordance with the terms of reference;  

 6. Calls upon all States, all parties to the conflict as well as civil society to 

cooperate fully with the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism and 

the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic 

to effectively fulfil their respective mandates and, in particular, to provide them 

with any information and documentation they may possess, as well as any other 

forms of assistance pertaining to their respective mandates;  

 7. Requests the United Nations system as a whole to fully cooperate with 

the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism and to promptly respond to 

any request, including access to all information and documentation, and decides that 

the Mechanism shall closely cooperate with the Independent International 

Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic in all aspects of its work;  

 8. Requests the Secretary-General to report on the implementation of the 

present resolution within 45 days of its adoption, and decides to revisit the question 

of funding of the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism as soon as 

possible.
