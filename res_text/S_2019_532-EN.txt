 France: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling all its previous resolutions, statements of its President and press 

statements on the situation in Mali,  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, unity and territorial 

integrity of Mali, emphasizing that the Malian authorities have primary responsibility 

for the provision of stability, security and protection of civilians throughout the 

territory of Mali,  

 Reaffirming the basic principles of peacekeeping, including consent of the 

parties, impartiality and non-use of force, except in self-defence and defence of the 

mandate, recognizing that the mandate of each peacekeeping mission is specific to 

the need and situation of the country concerned, and recalling its Presidential 

Statement of 14 May 2018 (S/PRST/2018/10), 

 Expressing grave concern about the continued deterioration of the security and 

humanitarian situation in Mali, including through the maintenance of a high level of 

asymmetric attacks by terrorist groups in the North and the escalat ion of 

intercommunal violence in the Centre, which have caused the loss of numerous 

innocent lives as well as numerous internally displaced people, people in critical need 

of assistance and children without access to education due to school closures, and 

further expressing deep concern that the situation in Mali negatively impacts that of 

neighbouring countries and of the Sahel region,  

 Emphasizing that security and stability in Mali are inextricably linked to that of 

the Sahel and West Africa, as well as to that of Libya and North Africa,  

 Strongly condemning the continued attacks against civilians, representatives 

from local, regional and State institutions, as well as national, international and UN 

security forces, including the Malian Defence and Security Forces (MDSF), the G5 

Sahel joint force (FC-G5S), the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated 

Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), the French forces and the European 

Union Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali),  

 Underlining that lasting peace and security in the Sahel region will not be 

achieved without a combination of political, security and development efforts 

benefitting all regions of Mali, as well as the full, effective and inclusive 

implementation of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali (“the 

Agreement”), which involves all Malian actors supportive of the peace process and 

ensures full, effective and meaningful participation of women and youth,

S/2019/532 
 

 

19-11053 2/15 

 

 Recognizing that more progress was made during the past nine months than 

during the first years after the signing of the Agreement, which were characterized by 

a slow pace of implementation, noting that a combination of some level of political 

will and international pressure, including through the prospect of sanctions, 

constituted an important factor in securing these positive results, and underlining that 

MINUSMA, along with the other security presences mentioned in resolution 2423 

(2018), significantly contributes to the implementation of the Agreement and to the 

stabilization of Mali, 

 Expressing a significant sense of impatience with parties over the persistent 

delays in the full implementation of key provisions of the Agreement, regretting the 

recent stagnation in the implementation process mentioned by the Independent 

Observer in its April 2019 report, noting that protracted delays in implementation 

contribute to a political and security vacuum jeopardizing the stability and 

development of Mali as well as the viability of the Agreement, and stressing the need 

for increased ownership and prioritization in the implementation of the Agreement,  

 Underlining that engaging in hostilities in violation of the Agreement as well as 

actions taken that obstruct, or that obstruct by prolonged delay, or that threaten the 

implementation of the Agreement constitute a basis for sanctions designations 

pursuant to resolution 2374 (2017), among other designation criteria,  

 Underlining that stabilization of the situation in Central Mali requires the 

implementation of a renewed and fully integrated strategy encompassing 

simultaneous pursuit of progress on security, governance, development, 

reconciliation, accountability, as well as protection and promotion of human rights,  

 Stressing the importance of ensuring the success of the inclusive political 

dialogue recently announced with the aim to build consensus on key political and 

institutional reforms, 

 Strongly condemning all violations and abuses of international human rights law 

and violations of international humanitarian law, including those involving 

extrajudicial and summary executions, arbitrary arrests and detentions and ill -

treatment of prisoners, sexual and gender-based violence, as well as killing, maiming, 

recruitment and use of children, attacks against schools, hospitals and humanitarian 

and medical personnel, and calling upon all parties to bring an end to such violations 

and abuses and to comply with their obligations under applicable international law, 

 Reiterating, in this regard, the importance of holding accountable all those 

responsible for such acts and that some of such acts referred to in the paragraph above 

may amount to crimes under the Rome Statute, and taking note that, acting upon the 

referral of the transitional authorities of Mali dated 13 July 2012, the Prosecutor of 

the International Criminal Court (ICC) opened on 16 January 2013 an investigation 

into alleged crimes committed on the territory of Mali since January 2012, 

 Emphasizing the need for adequate risk assessment and risk management 

strategies, by the government of Mali and the United Nations, of ecological changes, 

natural disasters, drought, desertification, land degradation, food insecurity, energy 

access, climate change, among other factors, on the security and stability of Mali,  

 Commending troop- and police- contributing countries of MINUSMA for their 

contribution, paying tribute to the peacekeepers who risk, as well as lost, their lives 

in this respect, 

 Further commending MINUSMA’s efforts to adopt a more robust posture over 

the past months as well as the intensification of the frequency and scale of its 

operations,

3/15 19-11053 

 

 Recognizing that, in light of the specific and challenging environment in which 

it is deployed, MINUSMA interacts with other security presences which have the 

potential to be mutually beneficial instruments to restore peace and stability in Mali 

and the Sahel region,  

 Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General (S/2019/454), 

 Determining that the situation in Mali continues to constitute a threat to 

international peace and security,  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 

  Implementation of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali 
 

 1. Urges the Government of Mali and the Plateforme and Coordination 

armed groups (“the Malian parties”) to continue to accelerate the implementation of 

the Agreement, through significant, meaningful and irreversible measures to be taken 

on an urgent basis, and further urges Malian parties to sign without delay a revised 

roadmap with a clear, realistic and binding timeline focused on a limited number of 

priorities related to the main pillars of the Agreement;  

 2. Strongly regrets that several provisions of the Agreement referenced in 

paragraph 4 of resolution 2423 (2018) have not yet been fully implemented or started, 

despite its repeated calls in this sense over the past months, recalls paragraph 3 of 

resolution 2423 (2018) expressing its intention to respond with measures pursuant to 

resolution 2374 (2017) should the parties not implement the agreed-upon 

commitments of the Roadmap adopted on 22 March 2018 within the announced 

timeframe; 

 3. Stresses that individuals or entities placed on the 2374 sanctions list shall 

not benefit from any financial, operational or logistical support from United Nations 

entities deployed in Mali, until their removal from the list and without prejudice to 

the exemptions set by paragraphs 2, 5, 6 and 7 of resolution 2374 (2017); 

 4. Urges the Malian parties to take immediate and concrete action to fulfil 

the following priority measures before the end of MINUSMA’s current mandate:

legislation establishing a regional territorial police force; 

 – resolve outstanding issues related to the concept of reconstituted and reformed 

MDSF, including through consultations between the Malian parties at the

redeployment of at least 3,000 members of the signatory armed groups in the 

MDSF, following an inclusive consultation process with the full engagement 

and consensus of the Malian parties and other relevant stakeholders, and 

develop and commence implementation of a comprehensive plan for the 

progressive redeployment of reconstituted and reformed MDSF to Northern 

Mali in a transparent manner with the full engagement and consensus of the 

Malian parties and other relevant stakeholders as part of a broader national
