  The Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Concerned about the increasing regional and global security challenges 
caused, inter alia, by the ongoing proliferation of ballistic missiles capable of 
delivering weapons of mass destruction, 

 Bearing in mind the purposes and principles of the United Nations and its role 
and responsibility in the field of international peace and security in accordance with 
the Charter of the United Nations, 

 Emphasizing the significance of regional and international efforts to prevent 
and curb comprehensively the proliferation of ballistic missile systems capable of 
delivering weapons of mass destruction, as a contribution to international peace and 
security,  



A/C.1/65/L.45/Rev.1  
 

10-60604 2 
 

 Welcoming the adoption of the Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic 
Missile Proliferation1 on 25 November 2002 at The Hague, and convinced that the 
Code of Conduct will contribute to enhancing transparency and confidence among 
States,  

 Recalling its resolutions 60/62 of 8 December 2005 and 63/64 of 2 December 
2008 entitled “The Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation”, 

 Recalling that the proliferation of ballistic missiles capable of delivering 
weapons of mass destruction, as recognized by the Security Council in its 
resolutions 1540 (2004) of 28 April 2004 and 1887 (2009) of 24 September 2009, 
constitutes a threat to international peace and security, 

 Confirming its commitment to the Declaration on International Cooperation in 
the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for the Benefit and in the Interest of All 
States, Taking into Particular Account the Needs of Developing Countries, as 
contained in the annex to its resolution 51/122 of 13 December 1996,  

 Recognizing that States should not be excluded from utilizing the benefits of 
space for peaceful purposes, but that in reaping such benefits and in conducting 
related cooperation they must not contribute to the proliferation of ballistic missiles 
capable of carrying weapons of mass destruction,  

 Mindful of the need to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 
and their means of delivery,  

 1. Notes with satisfaction that one hundred and thirty-one States have 
already subscribed to the Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile 
Proliferation as a practical step against the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction and their means of delivery;  

 2. Invites all States that have not yet subscribed to the Code of Conduct to 
do so;  

 3. Encourages States that have already subscribed to the Code of Conduct 
to make efforts to increase participation in the Code; 

 4. Welcomes progress in implementation of the Code of Conduct and all 
efforts to increase the efficiency of the Code, which contributes to enhancing 
transparency and building confidence among States through the submission of 
pre-launch notifications and annual declarations on space and ballistic missile 
activity; 

 5. Encourages the exploration of further ways and means to deal effectively 
with the problem of the proliferation of ballistic missiles capable of delivering 
weapons of mass destruction;  

 6. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-seventh session 
the item entitled “The Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile 
Proliferation”.
