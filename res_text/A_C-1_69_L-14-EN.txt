 The General Assembly, 

 Recognizing the common interest of all mankind in the exploration and use of 

outer space for peaceful purposes, 

 Seriously concerned about the possibility of an arms race in outer space, and 

bearing in mind the importance of articles III and IV of the Treaty on Principles 

Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, 

including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies,1 

 Conscious that the prevention of an arms race in outer space would avert a 

grave danger to international peace and security,  

 Reaffirming that further measures should be examined in the search for 

agreements to prevent an arms race in outer space,  

 Emphasizing the paramount importance of strict compliance with the existing  

legal regime providing for the peaceful use of outer space, 

 Reaffirming its recognition that the legal regime applicable to outer space by 

itself does not guarantee prevention of an arms race in outer space and that there is a 

need to consolidate and reinforce that regime, 

 Welcoming, in this regard, the draft treaty on the prevention of the placement 

of weapons in outer space and of the threat or use of force against outer space

objects,2 introduced by China and the Russian Federation at the Conference on 

Disarmament in 2008, and the submission of its updated version3 in 2014,  

 Considering that transparency and confidence-building measures in outer 

space activities are an integral part of the draft treaty referred to above, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions, including resolutions 45/55 B of 

4 December 1990 and 48/74 B of 16 December 1993, which, inter alia, confirm the 

importance of transparency and confidence-building measures as a means conducive 

to ensuring the attainment of the objective of the prevention of an arms race in outer 

space, 

 Noting the importance of the political statements made by a number of States 

that they would not be the first to place weapons in outer space,4 

 1. Reaffirms the importance and urgency of the objective to prevent an arms 

race in outer space and the willingness of States to contribute to reaching this 

common goal; 

 2. Reiterates that the Conference on Disarmament, as the single multilateral 

negotiating forum, has the primary role in the negotiation of a multilateral 

agreement, or agreements, as appropriate, on the prevention of an arms race in outer 

space in all its aspects; 

 3. Urges an early start of substantive work based on the updated draft treaty 

on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space and of the threat or 

use of force against outer space objects
3
 submitted by China and the Russian 

Federation at the Conference on Disarmament, under the agenda item “Prevention of 

an arms race in outer space”; 

 4. Stresses that, while such an agreement is not yet concluded, other 

measures may contribute to ensuring that weapons are not placed in outer space; 

 5. Encourages all States, especially space-faring nations, to consider the 

possibility of upholding as appropriate a political commitment not to be the first  to 

place weapons in outer space; 

 6. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventieth session the 

item entitled “No first placement of weapons in outer space”.
