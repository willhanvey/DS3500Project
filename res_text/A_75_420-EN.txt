  Draft resolution II  

  Question of American Samoa  
 

 

 The General Assembly,  

 Having considered the question of American Samoa and examined the report of 

the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the 

Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for 

2020,1  

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on American 

Samoa2 and other relevant information,  

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are 

valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people 

of American Samoa and in conformity with the clearly defined principles contained 

in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of 

15 December 1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,  

 Expressing concern that 60 years after the adoption of the Declaration on the 

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, 3 there still remain 

17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including American Samoa,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2020 and the plans of action for the Second 4 and Third International 

Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism,  

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of 

American Samoa require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the options 

for self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical location, 

size of population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  

 Acknowledging the outcome of the referendum held on 6 November 2018, in 

which the proposal to give the Fono, the Territory’s legislature, the authority to 

override the Governor’s veto was rejected,  

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-

Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the 

Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world economy 

and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that 

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of American Samoa in respect of their right to self-determination should 

be ascertained,

20-15368 10/84 

 

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the 

local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional 

organizations,  

 Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding 

of the political status of the people of American Samoa and to fulfil its mandate 

effectively, it is important for it to be apprised by the United S tates of America as the 

administering Power and to receive information from other appropriate sources, 

including the representatives of the Territory, concerning the wishes and aspirations 

of the people of the Territory,  

 Aware of the importance both to American Samoa and to the Special Committee 

of the participation of elected and appointed representatives of American Samoa in 

the work of the Committee,  

 Recognizing the need for the Special Committee to ensure that the appropriate 

bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at 

assisting the people of American Samoa with their inalienable right to self -

determination and in gaining a better understanding of the options for self -

determination, on a case-by-case basis,  

 Mindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the 

Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 

representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 

the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the 

seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial element 

in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of 

the Territories,  

 Recalling the Caribbean regional seminar on the theme “Implementation of the 

Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism: accelerating 

decolonization through renewed commitment and pragmatic measures”, held by the 

Special Committee in Grand Anse, Grenada, and hosted by the Government of 

Grenada from 2 to 4 May 2019, as a significant and forward-looking event, which 

enabled the participants to assess progress made and address challenges faced in the 

decolonization process, review the existing working methods of the Committee and 

renew its commitment to implementing its historic task,  

 Recalling also the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted 

by the seminar, which are annexed to the report of the Special Committee 5 and which 

outline the findings of the seminar, including, especially, the way forward for the 

decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General 

Assembly of the period 2011–2020 as the Third International Decade for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,6  

 Noting with appreciation the contribution to the development of some 

Territories by the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations 

system, in particular the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, 

the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the United Nations 

Development Programme and the World Food Programme, as well as regional 

institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean Community, the 

Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, the Pacific Islands Forum and the agencies 

of the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific,

11/84 20-15368 

 

 Recalling the statement made by a representative of the Governor of American 

Samoa at the 2018 Pacific regional seminar,7  

 Recalling also the statement made by that representative in which he expressed 

his view that the people of American Samoa were happy with the relationship with 

the administering Power, which could be described as strong and healthy as well as 

beneficial to the people and the Government of the Territory, and that the most 

important benefit to American Samoa had been the protection of its indigenous rights 

to the land as provided for in the Deeds of Cession,  

 Recalling further the statement made by the representative that the political 

status of American Samoa as an unincorporated and unorganized territory of the 

administering Power limited its ability to self-government and exposed it to decisions 

made by the administering Power,  

 Recalling the statement by the representative that, while certain aspects of the 

form of government of the Territory and its relationship with the administering Power 

were challenging and in need of improvement, the solutions could be found within 

the confines of the political and judicial systems of the administering Power and that 

the territorial Government was pursuing legal actions to counteract the impact of 

unfavourable federal actions and sought the international community ’s tacit support,  

 Recalling also the information provided by the representative that the 

Government of American Samoa intended to pursue additional funding from the 

administering Power to maintain and expand the work of the Office of Political Status, 

Constitutional Review and Federal Relations,  

 Aware of the work of the Future Political Status Study Commission, completed 

in 2006, the release of its report, with recommendations, in January 2007 and the 

creation of the American Samoa Constitutional Review Committee, as well as the 

holding in June 2010 of the Territory’s fourth Constitutional Convention,  

 Recalling the decisions of the United States judiciary in which it dismissed a 

lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that would have asserted that the citizenship 

clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States extended 

to American Samoa, and taking note of the decision in which the petition for a writ 

of certiorari was denied,8  

 Stressing the importance of regional ties for the development of a small island 

Territory,  

 Recalling the elections held in the Territory in November 2018 to elect 

20 members of the American Samoa House of Representatives and the delegate to the 

United States House of Representatives,9  

 Recalling also its resolutions 74/270 of 2 April 2020, entitled “Global solidarity 

to fight the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)”, and 74/274 of 20 April 2020, 

entitled “International cooperation to ensure global access to medicines, vaccines and 

medical equipment to face COVID-19”,  

 1. Reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of American Samoa to self -

determination, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and with General 

Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), containing the Declaration on the Granting of 

Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples;

 2. Also reaffirms that, in the process of the decolonization of American 

Samoa, there is no alternative to the principle of self-determination, which is also a 

fundamental human right, as recognized under the relevant human rights conventions;  

 3. Further reaffirms that it is ultimately for the people of American Samoa to 

determine freely their future political status in accordance with the relevant 

provisions of the Charter, the Declaration and the relevant resolutions of the General 

Assembly, and in that connection calls upon the administering Power, in cooperation 

with the territorial Government and appropriate bodies of the United Nations system, 

to develop political education programmes for the Territory in order to foster an 

awareness among the people of their right to self -determination in conformity with 

the legitimate political status options, based on the principles clearly defined in 

Assembly resolution 1541 (XV) and other relevant resolutions and decisions;  

 4. Takes note of the work of the territorial Government with respect to 

moving forward on political status, local autonomy and self-governance issues with 

a view to making political and economic progress, and recalls the establishment in 

April 2016 of the Office of Political Status, Constitutional Review and Federal 

Relations;  

 5. Recalls the indication by the territorial Government that American Samoa 

should remain on the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories, under the purview of the 

Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the 

Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, until 

such time as its people have exercised their right to self-determination;  

 6. Also recalls the invitation extended in 2015 by the Governor of American 

Samoa to the Special Committee to send a visiting mission to the Territory, calls upon 

the administering Power to facilitate such a mission if the territorial Government so 

desires, and requests the Chair of the Special Committee to take all the steps necessary 

to that end;  

 7. Requests the administering Power to assist the Territory by facilitating its 

work concerning public educational outreach efforts, consistent with Article 73 b of 

the Charter, and in that regard calls upon the relevant United Nations organizations 

to provide assistance to the Territory, if requested;  

 8. Stresses the importance of the Special Committee being apprised of the 

views and wishes of the people of American Samoa and enhancing its understanding 

of their conditions, including the nature and scope of the existing political and 

constitutional arrangements between American Samoa and the administering Power;  

 9. Calls upon the administering Power to participate in and cooperate fully 

with the work of the Special Committee in order to implement the provisions of 

Article 73 e of the Charter and the Declaration and in order to advise the Committee 

on the implementation of the provisions under Article 73  b of the Charter on efforts

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of Bermuda in respect of their right to self-determination should be 

ascertained,  

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the 

local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional

of the people of Guam in respect of their right to self-determination should be

  Draft resolution IX  

  Question of Montserrat 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Having considered the question of Montserrat and examined the report of the 

Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the 

Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for 

2020,1  

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on Montserrat 2 and 

other relevant information,  

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are 

valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people 

of Montserrat and in conformity with the clearly defined principles contained in 

General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of 

15 December 1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,  

 Expressing concern that 60 years after the adoption of the Declaration on the 

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples,3 there still remain 

17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including Montserrat,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2020 and the plans of action for the Second 4 and Third International 

Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism,  

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of 

Montserrat require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the options for 

self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size,  geographical location, 

size of population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-

Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the 

Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world economy 

and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that 

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of  the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of Montserrat in respect of their right to self -determination should be 

ascertained,  

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the 

local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional 

organizations,

 Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding 

of the political status of the people of Montserrat and to fulfil its mandate effectively, 

it is important for it to be apprised by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 

Northern Ireland as the administering Power and to receive information from other 

appropriate sources, including the representatives of the Territory, concerning the 

wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory,  

 Aware of the importance both to Montserrat and to the Special Committee of the 

participation of elected and appointed representatives of Montserrat in the work of 

the Committee,  

 Recognizing the need for the Special Committee to ensure that the appropriate 

bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at 

assisting the people of Montserrat with their inalienable right to self -determination 

and in gaining a better understanding of the options for self-determination, on a case-

by-case basis,  

 Mindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the 

Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 

representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 

the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the 

seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial element 

in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of 

the Territories,  

 Recalling the Caribbean regional seminar on the theme “Implementation of the 

Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism: accelerating 

decolonization through renewed commitment and pragmatic measures”, held by the 

Special Committee in Grand Anse, Grenada, and hosted by the Government of 

Grenada from 2 to 4 May 2019, as a significant and forward-looking event, which 

enabled the participants to assess progress made and address challenges faced in the 

decolonization process, review the existing working methods of the Committee and 

renew its commitment to implementing its historic task,  

 Recalling also the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted 

by the seminar, which are annexed to the report of the Special Committee 5 and which 

outline the findings of the seminar, including, especially, the way forward for the 

decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General 

Assembly of the period 2011–2020 as the Third International Decade for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,6  

 Recalling further the statements made by the Premier of Montserrat before the 

Special Committee in June 2018 and at the 2018 Pacific regional seminar, in which 

he expressed the view that the previous request made for the removal of Montserrat 

from the agenda of the Special Committee should be reversed,  

 Recalling the information provided by the Premier that Montserrat could not 

achieve its development goals if its economic dependency continued, compounded by 

ongoing financial challenges, and that securing funding for  rebuilding key 

infrastructure lost and helping evacuees from the 1995 volcanic crisis required an 

intervention from the Special Committee as a neutral partner,  

 Noting with appreciation the contribution to the development of some 

Territories by the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations 

system, in particular the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, 

the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the United Nations

  Question of Pitcairn 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Having considered the question of Pitcairn and examined the report of the 

Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the 

Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for 

2020,1  

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on Pitcairn2 and 

other relevant information,  

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are 

valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people 

of Pitcairn and in conformity with the clearly defined principles contained in General 

Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of 15 December 

1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,  

 Expressing concern that 60 years after the adoption of the Declaration on the 

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, 3 there still remain 

17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including Pitcairn,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2020 and the plans of action for the Second 4 and Third International 

Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism,  

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of 

Pitcairn require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the options for self -

determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical location, size of 

population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-

Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the 

Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world economy 

and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that 

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of Pitcairn in respect of their right to self-determination should be 

ascertained,  

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the 

local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional 

organizations,

 Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding 

of the political status of the people of Pitcairn and to fulfil its mandate effectively, it 

is important for it to be apprised by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 

Ireland as the administering Power and to receive information from other appropriate 

sources, including the representatives of the Territory, concerning the wishes and 

aspirations of the people of the Territory,

case basis,

in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of 

the Territories,

Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism: accelerating 

decolonization through renewed commitment and pragmatic measures”, held by the 

Special Committee in Grand Anse, Grenada, and hosted by the Government of 

Grenada from 2 to 4 May 2019, as a significant and forward-looking event, which 

enabled the participants to assess progress made and address challenges faced in the 

decolonization process, review the existing working methods of the Committee and 

renew its commitment to implementing its historic task,  

 Recalling also the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted 

by the seminar, which are annexed to the report of the Special Committee 5 and which 

outline the findings of the seminar, including, especially, the way forward for the 

decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General 

Assembly of the period 2011–2020 as the Third International Decade for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,6  

 Noting with serious concern that the Territory last participated in the activities 

of the Special Committee in 2004,  

 Taking into account the unique character of Pitcairn in terms of population, area 

and access,  

 Aware that the administering Power and the territorial Government have 

implemented a governance structure to strengthen administrative capacity in the 

Territory, based on consultations with the people of the Territory,  

 Noting that the administering Power and the territorial Government have 

developed a five-year strategic development plan, covering the period from 2019 to 

2024, that sets out the views and aspirations of the people of the Territory for the 

socioeconomic development of the Territory,

17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including Saint Helena,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2020 and the plans of action for the Second 4 and Third International 

Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism,  

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of 

Saint Helena require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the options for 

self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical location, 

size of population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-

Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the 

Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world economy 

and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that 

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV), 

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of Saint Helena in respect of their right to self-determination should be 

ascertained, 

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the 

local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional 

organizations,

 Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding 

of the political status of the people of Saint Helena and to fulfil its mandate

other appropriate sources, including the representatives of the Territory, concerning 

the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory,

by-case basis,  

 Mindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the 

Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 

representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 

the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the 

seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial element 

in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of 

the Territories,  

 Recalling the Caribbean regional seminar on the theme “Implementation of the 

Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism: accelerating

Assembly of the period 2011–2020 as the Third International Decade for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,6

Development Programme and the World Food Programme, as well as regional 

institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean Community, the

concerns expressed by a representative of the Legislative Council of Saint Helena

of Tokelau by New Zealand and the specialized agencies and other organizations of 

the United Nations system, in particular the United Nations Development Programme 

and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,  

 Bearing in mind that, as a small island Territory, Tokelau exemplifies the 

situation of most remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories and that, as a case study 

pointing to successful cooperation for decolonization, Tokelau has wider significance 

for the United Nations as it seeks to complete its work in decolonization,  

 Recalling the status of Tokelau as an associate member of the Food and 

Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and of the Pacific Islands Forum,

2003, following extensive consultations undertaken in all three villages, to explore

decision in August 2005 to hold in February 2006 a referendum on self -determination 

on the basis of a draft constitution for Tokelau and a draft treaty of free association 

with New Zealand, and its subsequent decision to hold a further referendum in 

October 2007, and bearing in mind also that the two referendums did not produce the 

two-thirds majority of valid votes cast required by the General Fono to change the 

status of Tokelau from that of a Non-Self-Governing Territory under the 

administration of New Zealand,  

 Noting the holding of free and fair elections in the Territory on 23 January 2020,

statement for the Pacific regional seminar held in Saint George’s from 9 to 11 May 

2018 that the self-determination process of the Territory could not be addressed in 

isolation from the threat of climate change, the rise in sea level and the challenges to 

the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,2 and bearing in mind the intention of 

Tokelau to articulate its development and other priorities in the National Strategic

medical evacuations and general transport between the atolls, which entered into 

service in April 2019, 

 Recalling its resolutions 74/270 of 2 April 2020, entitled “Global solidarity to 

fight the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)”, and 74/274 of 20 April 2020, 

entitled “International cooperation to ensure global access to medicines, vaccines and
