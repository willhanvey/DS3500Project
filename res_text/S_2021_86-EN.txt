  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 

draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 10 January 2021 on his Good 

Offices S/2021/5 and on the United Nations operation in Cyprus (S/2021/4), and 

expressing its full support for his Good Offices, including the existing body of work, 

to remain available to assist the sides,  

 Underscoring that the responsibility for finding a solution lies first and foremost 

with the Cypriots themselves, and reaffirming the primary role of the United Nations 

in assisting the parties to bring the Cyprus conflict and division of the island to a 

comprehensive and durable settlement with a sense of urgency,  

 Expressing full support for the Secretary-General’s ongoing efforts, and 

welcoming his intention to convene an informal “five plus UN meeting” with the 

leaders of the two Cypriot communities and the Guarantor powers at the earliest 

opportunity, further welcoming the stated determination of the leaders of the two 

communities to respond positively in this regard to find common ground between the 

parties to negotiate a sustainable lasting solution to the Cyprus problem within a 

foreseeable horizon, 

 Urging the sides to renew their efforts to achieve an enduring, comprehensive 

and just settlement based on a bicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality, 

as set out in relevant Security Council resolutions, including OP4 of its resolution 

716 (1991), 

 Stressing that the status quo is unsustainable, and that the lack of an agreement 

furthers political tensions and deepens the estrangement of both communities, risking 

irreversible changes on the ground, and reducing the prospects of a settlement,  

 Expressing deep concern at the ongoing tensions in the eastern Mediterranean 

over hydrocarbons exploration, convinced of the many important benefits, including 

economic benefits, for all Cypriots that would flow from a comprehensive and durable 

settlement, and reiterating the Secretary-General’s call for serious efforts to avoid 

any further escalation and to defuse tensions,  

 Recalling its Presidential Statement (S/PRST/2020/9), which expresses deep 

concern at developments in Varosha, and calls for the reversal of this course of action, 

reaffirming the status of Varosha as set out in its previous resolutions, and reiterating 

that no actions should be carried out in relation to Varosha that are not in accordance 

with those resolutions, and stressing the need to avoid any unilateral actions that could 

trigger tensions on the island and undermine the prospects for a peaceful settlement,

 Recalling its resolution 1325 (2000) and related resolutions, recognising that 

the full, equal and meaningful participation and leadership of women is essential in 

building peace in Cyprus and will contribute to making any future settlement 

sustainable, welcoming efforts to bring together a broader range of women actors on 

both sides, acknowledging that the gender-sensitive socioeconomic impact 

assessment that was launched 17 February 2020 in response to resolution 2453 (2019) 

substantiated that delaying a settlement in Cyprus increases both the economic, and 

non-economic costs of the prevailing political status quo, looking forward to the full 

and swift implementations of its recommendations, encouraging the sides to ensure 

the needs and perspectives of women are addressed in a future settlement,  

 Recalling its resolution 2250 (2015) and related resolutions that recognise the 

important and positive contribution of youth in efforts for the maintenance and 

promotion of peace and security, and as a key aspect of the sustainability, 

inclusiveness and success of peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts, and further 

encourages the full, equal and meaningful participation of youth in this process, 

 Recognising that effective contact and communication between the sides 

enhances the prospects for settlement and is in the interests of all Cypriots, and helps 

to address island-wide matters, including health, crime, environmental protection, and 

issues related to the adverse impacts of climate change,  

 Recognising the ongoing impact on the island of Cyprus of the COVID-19 

pandemic and the efforts made by both communities to suppress the spread of the 

virus and mitigate its effects, 

 Regretting that the sides have continued to pursue largely uncoordinated 

responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and expressing concern that the closure of the 

crossing points along the Green line has limited opportunities for bicommunal 

engagement and trust-building activities, and that the continued and prolonged 

closure of some crossing points threatens to set back the progress made in this area 

since 2003, 

 Expressing concern at the continued deterioration of the law and order situation 

in Pyla, and urging both sides to continue to work with UNFICYP to establish 

effective measures to tackle criminal activities,  

 Reiterating the importance of confidence-building measures and their timely 

implementation, and urging the sides to step up their efforts to promote 

intercommunal contacts, reconciliation and the active engagement of civil society, in 

particular women and youth, 

 Noting that the Government of Cyprus is agreed that in view of the prevailing 

conditions on the island it is necessary to keep the United Nations Peacekeeping Force 

in Cyprus (UNFICYP) beyond 31 January 2021,  

 Welcoming measures to date to strengthen the liaison and engagement capacity 

of the mission, noting the importance of transition planning in relation to the 

settlement, and emphasising the need to review regularly all peacekeeping operations, 

including UNFICYP, to ensure efficiency and effectiveness,  

 Expressing appreciation to Member States that contribute personnel to 

UNFICYP, and noting the continued voluntary contributions to the funding of 

UNFICYP by the Government of Cyprus and the Government of Greece,  

 Noting with appreciation the efforts of the Secretary-General, his Special 

Representative Elizabeth Spehar, and senior United Nations official Jane Holl Lute,  

 1. Reaffirms all its relevant resolutions on Cyprus, in particular resolution 

1251 (1999) and recalls the importance of achieving an enduring, comprehensive and

just settlement based on a bicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality, as 

set out in relevant Security Council resolutions, including OP4 of its resolution 716 

(1991); 

 2. Fully supports the Secretary-General’s decision to convene an informal 

“five plus UN” meeting between the leaders of the two Cypriot Communities and the 

Guarantor Powers at the earliest opportunity, and urges the sides and all involved 

participants to approach these talks in the spiri t of openness, flexibility and 

compromise and to show the necessary political will and commitment to freely 

negotiate a mutually acceptable settlement under United Nations auspices;  

 3. Reiterates its call for a reduction of tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean, 

and underlines that disputes should be resolved peacefully in accordance with 

applicable international law, and further calls upon the leaders of the two Cypriot 

communities and all involved parties to refrain from any actions and rhetoric that 

might damage chances of success; 

 4. Recalls its resolution 2537 (2020) and calls upon the two leaders 

urgently to: 

 (a) provide the necessary political support and overall guidance to free the 

Technical Committees from obstructions in their work and enable them to function 

effectively, and to empower them to submit proposals for their consideration to 

enhance intercommunal contacts and improve the daily lives of all Cypriots, and 

consider the advice of the Good Offices Mission of the Secretary-General regarding 

further ways to empower the Technical Committees and improve their performance;  

 (b) engage the Technical Committees more actively to ensure effective 

coordination and cooperation on health matters,  particularly in response to the 

COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious diseases which have island-wide 

implications, including through the effective use of the expertise available in the 

bicommunal Technical Committees on Health, Crisis Management, Humanitarian 

Affairs and Economic Matters; 

 (c) ensure effective coordination and cooperation on criminal matters;  

 (d) promote peace education across the island, including by further 

empowering the Technical Committee on Education to implement the 

recommendations contained in its joint report of 2017, in particular those concerning 

policymaking, and to address impediments to peace in school materials, including 

text books, as a contribution to trust-building between the communities, on which 

there continues to be no progress; 

 (e) improve the public atmosphere for negotiation to secure a settlement, 

including by preparing the communities for a settlement through public messages on 

the way ahead, and delivering more constructive and harmonised messages, including 

by more explicitly encouraging contact and cooperation between the communities and 

providing direct support to grassroots people-to-people initiatives, and by refraining 

from actions or rhetoric that detracts from a successful process or could make it more  

difficult to achieve; 

 (f) increase their support to, and ensure a meaningful role for, civil society 

engagement in peace efforts, in particular strengthening the participation of women’s 

organisations and youth in the process, including by empowering the  Technical 

Committee on Gender Equality to meet and develop an action plan supporting 

women’s full, equal, and meaningful participation in peace talks and providing direct 

support and encouragement to civil society organisations to enhance intercommunal 

contact and trust-building, and to support implementation of the recommendations of 

the gender sensitive socioeconomic impact assessment to address existing barriers

and ensure a future peace agreement can more equally benefit men and women in 

Cyprus; 

 5. Regrets the lack of progress on an effective mechanism for direct military 

contacts between the sides and the relevant involved parties, requests the Secretary-

General to report further on the reasons behind this lack of progress, and urges full 

engagement with the proposal on the establishment of such a mechanism presented 

by UNFICYP, and its timely implementation;  

 6. Calls upon the sides to reduce existing barriers to intercommunal contact, 

emphasizes the importance of effective communication for risk -mitigation and trust-

building between the communities, and urges the sides to agree and implement further 

confidence building measures that can contribute to a conducive environment for 

settlement, including those related to the military, economic cooperation and trade; 

 7. Further calls on the leaders of both communities to urgently agree on the 

reopening of all the crossing points and the return to the operating status that existed 

prior to 29 February 2020 as soon as practically achievable, and to work on 

harmonizing the protocols governing the crossing points, and urges effective 

coordination to prevent the spread of COVID-19, ensuring any continuing restrictions 

on movement across the island to prevent the spread of COVID-19 do not go beyond 

what is necessary to protect public health; and noting that the opening of the crossings 

since 2003 has been an important confidence-building measure between both 

communities and one which is essential for the settlement process;  

 8. Commends the ongoing work of the Committee on Missing Persons, and 

calls upon all parties expeditiously to enhance their cooperation with the Committee’s 

work, in particular through providing full access without delay to all areas and 

responding in a timely manner to requests for archival information on possible burial 

sites; 

 9. Expresses its full support for UNFICYP, and decides to extend its mandate 

for a further period ending on 31 July 2021;

quo along the ceasefire lines, urges the sides and all involved parties to respect 

UNFICYP’s mandated authority in, and delineation of, the buffer zone, urges the use 

of the 2018 United Nations aide-memoire by the sides to ensure peace and security in 

the buffer zone, calls on the Secretary-General to report to the Security Council and 

troop-contributing countries any actions that impede UNFICYP’s ability to fulfil its 

mandate, and calls on both sides to remove all unauthorised constructions and to 

prevent unauthorised military or civilian activities within and along the ceasefire 

lines, and urges both sides to take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety and 

security of UNFICYP personnel; 

 11. Reiterates its calls on the Turkish Cypriot side and Turkish forces to 

restore in Strovilia the military status quo which existed there prior to 30 June 2000, 

and reaffirms that UNFICYP’s freedom of movement should be respected;  

 12. Recalls the status of Varosha as set out in relevant resolutions, including 

resolutions 550 (1984) and 789 (1992), and its Presidential Statement 

(S/PRST/2020/9), which expresses deep concern at developments in Varosha, and 

calls for the reversal of this course of action, and reaffirms that UNFICYP’s freedom 

of movement should be respected; 

 13. Welcomes the announcement that 18 suspected hazardous areas across the 

island have now been cleared of mines, and urges the leaders of both communities to 

agree and continue a plan of work to achieve a mine-free Cyprus;

 14. Requests UNFICYP to take fully into account gender considerations as a 

cross-cutting issue throughout its mandate; requests the Secretary-General and troop- 

and police-contributing countries to increase the number of women in UNFICYP and 

ensure the full, equal and meaningful participation of uniformed and civilian women 

at all levels, and in all aspects of its operations including senior leadership positions, 

and to implement other relevant provisions of resolution 2538 (2020); 

 15. Welcomes the initiatives undertaken by the Secretary-General to 

standardise a culture of performance in UN peacekeeping, recalls its requests in its 

resolutions 2378 (2017) and 2436 (2018) that the Secretary-General ensure that 

performance data related to the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations is used to 

improve mission operations, including decisions such as those regarding deployment, 

remediation, repatriation and incentives, reaffirms its support for the development of 

a comprehensive and integrated performance policy framework that identifies clear 

standards of performance for evaluating all United Nations civilian and uniformed 

personnel working in and supporting peacekeeping operations that facilitates 

effective and full implementation of mandates, and includes comprehensive and 

objective methodologies based on clear and well-defined benchmarks to ensure 

accountability for underperformance and incentives and recognition for outstanding 

performance, calls on the United Nations to apply this framework to UNFICYP as 

described in its resolution 2436 (2018), and notes the efforts of the Secretary-General 

to develop a comprehensive performance assessment system; 

 16. Requests the Secretary-General to continue to take necessary measures to 

ensure full compliance of all UNFICYP personnel, civilian and uniformed, including 

mission leadership and mission support personnel, with the United Nations zero -

tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and to keep the Council fully 

informed about the Mission’s progress in this regard, including by reporting on the 

start, agreed deadlines, and outcomes of UNSCR 2272 reviews, stresses the need to 

prevent such exploitation and abuse and to improve how these allegations are 

addressed in line with its resolution 2272 (2016), and urges troop- and police-

contributing countries to continue to take appropriate preventative  action, including 

vetting of all personnel, pre-deployment and in-mission awareness training, and to 

take appropriate steps to ensure full accountability in cases of such conduct involving 

their personnel, including through timely investigations of allega tions by troop- and 

police-contributing countries, and UNFICYP as appropriate, holding perpetrators to 

account, and repatriating units when there is credible evidence of widespread or 

systemic sexual exploitation and abuse by those units;  

 17. Requests the Secretary-General to submit by 10 July 2021 a report on his 

Good Offices, in particular on progress towards reaching a consensus starting -point 

for meaningful results-oriented negotiations leading to a settlement, encourages the
