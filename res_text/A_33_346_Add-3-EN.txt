The General Assembly, 

Aware of the special nature of the operations of the United Nations Emergency 
Force and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force and the difficulties 
inherent in their financing,

withholdings of certain Member States of their contributions to the Forces, and 
the resulting difficulties to pay the troop-contributing Governments the amounts 
due to them on a current basis, mainly because of the lack of funds in the Special 
Account,

outstanding obligations of the United Nations Emergency Force and the United 
Nations Disengagement Observer Force to Governments provding contingents and/or 
logistic support to the Forces,

comments of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;~/
