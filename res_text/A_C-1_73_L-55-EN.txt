 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 69/62 of 2 December 2014 and 71/36 of 5 December 

2016, 

 Noting the threat to international peace and security posed by illicit brokering 

activities circumventing the international arms control and non-proliferation 

framework,  

 Concerned that, if proper measures are not taken, the illicit brokering of arms 

in all its aspects will adversely affect the maintenance of international peace and 

security, and prolong conflicts, and could be an obstacle to sustainable economic and 

social development and result in illicit transfers of conventional arms and the 

acquisition of weapons of mass destruction by non-State actors, 

 Recognizing the need for Member States to prevent and combat illicit brokering 

activities, which covers not only conventional arms but also materials, equipment and 

technology that could contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 

and their means of delivery, 

 Reaffirming that efforts to prevent and combat illicit brokering activities should 

not hamper the legitimate arms trade and international cooperation with respect to 

materials, equipment and technology for peaceful purposes,  

 Recalling Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) of 28 April 2004, in 

particular paragraph 3, in which the Council determined that all States shall develop 

and maintain appropriate effective border controls and law enforcement efforts to 

detect, deter, prevent and combat, including through international cooperation when 

necessary, illicit trafficking in and brokering of materials related to nuclear, chemical

or biological weapons and their means of delivery, in accordance with their national 

legal authorities and legislation and consistent with international law, and taking note 

of the comprehensive review of the status of implementation of resolution 1540 

(2004) conducted in 2016, 

 Noting international efforts to prevent and combat illicit arms brokering, in 

particular in small arms and light weapons, as demonstrated by the adoption in 2001 

of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in 

Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects,1 and the entry into force in 2005 

of the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their 

Parts and Components and Ammunition, supplementing the United Nations 

Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,2  

 Welcoming efforts to implement the Programme of Action and the International 

Instrument to Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely and Reliable Manner, 

Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons,3 including the holding of mandated meetings 

to review their implementation and the submission by Member States of national 

reports, 

 Recognizing the importance of States parties to the Arms Trade Treaty4 taking 

measures, pursuant to their national laws, to regulate brokering taking place under 

their jurisdiction, in accordance with article 10 of the Treaty,  

 Taking note of Security Council resolutions 2117 (2013) of 26 September 2013 

and 2220 (2015) of 22 May 2015 on small arms and light weapons, in which the 

Council encouraged cooperation and information-sharing on suspect brokering 

activities to address the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small 

arms and light weapons, 

 Taking note also of the report issued on 30 August 2007 by the Group of 

Governmental Experts established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/81 of 

8 December 2005 to consider further steps to enhance international cooperation in 

preventing, combating and eradicating illicit brokering in small arms and light 

weapons5 as an international initiative within the framework of the United Nations,  

 Underlining the inherent right of Member States to determine the specific scope 

and content of domestic regulations in accordance with their legislative frameworks 

and export control systems, consistent with international law,  

 Welcoming the efforts made by Member States to implement laws and/or 

administrative measures to regulate arms brokering within their legal systems,  

 Encouraging cooperation among Member States to prevent and combat illicit 

trafficking in nuclear materials, and recognizing in this regard existing efforts at all 

levels, consistent with international law,  

 Welcoming the technical guidance and capacity-building assistance provided by 

the International Atomic Energy Agency to enhance nuclear security globally,  

 Encouraging Member States in a position to do so to share their experience and 

practices in relation to the control of illicit brokering and to further enhance 

international cooperation to this end,
