Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial

Welcoming the Constitution adopted by the Loya Jirga on 4 January 2004
which reflects the determination of the Afghan people to ensure the transition of
their country towards a stable and democratic State,

Recognizing that the United Nations must continue to play its central and
impartial role in the international efforts to assist the Afghan people in consolidating
peace in Afghanistan and rebuilding their country,

Reaffirming the Transitional Administration as the sole legitimate government
of Afghanistan pending the democratic presidential and parliamentary elections
envisioned in the Bonn Agreement as in the Afghan constitution,

Reiterating its strong support for the full implementation of the Bonn
Agreement (S/2001/1154) and supporting also the objectives of the international
conference scheduled to take place in Berlin from 31 March to 1 April 2004 to allow
the Afghan authorities and the international community to reaffirm their long-term
commitment to take the transitional process in Afghanistan forward, including by
demonstrating support for the Afghan political process and its national security, as
well as by confirming and generating international financial and other donations,

Recalling the importance of the coming elections to establish democratic
Afghan authorities as a further step towards implementation of the Bonn Agreement
and welcoming in that regard the creation of a Joint Electoral Management Body and
the initial progress made in voter registration,

December 2002 on Good-Neighbourly relations (S/2002/1416), and encouraging all

S/2004/249

Stressing also the importance of extending central government authority to all
parts of Afghanistan, of comprehensive nationwide disarmament, demobilization
and reintegration of all armed factions, and of security sector reform including
reconstitution of the new Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police,

Welcoming the visit of the Security Council Mission to Afghanistan in

(S/2004/230) and the recommendations contained therein;

3. Stresses the importance of the provision of sufficient security and of
significant donor support for the holding of credible national elections in accordance

states and international organizations to coordinate closely with UNAMA and the

and the contribution of the International Observer Group in this regard; stresses that

strong economy and a secure environment in Afghanistan and cannot be achieved

notes with concern in this regard the assessment made by UNODC in its last Afghan
opium survey;
