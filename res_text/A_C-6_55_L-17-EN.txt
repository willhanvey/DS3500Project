terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomsoever
committed,

Mindful of the need to enhance the role of the United Nations and the relevant
specialized agencies in combating international terrorism, and of the proposals of

Assembly encouraged States to review urgently the scope of the existing
international legal provisions on the prevention, repression and elimination of

Taking note of the final document of the Thirteenth Ministerial Conference of
the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Cartagena, Colombia on 8 and 9
April 2000,3 which reiterated the collective position of the Movement of Non-
Aligned Countries on terrorism and reaffirmed the previous initiative of the Twelfth
Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at
Durban, South Africa, from 29 August to 3 September 1998, calling for an
international summit conference under the auspices of the United Nations to
formulate a joint organized response of the international community to terrorism in
all its forms and manifestations,4

Recalling its decision in resolution 54/110 of 9 December 1999 that the Ad
Hoc Committee established by General Assembly resolution 51/210 of 17 December
1996 should address the question of convening a high-level conference  under the
auspices of the United Nations to formulate a joint organized response of the

be invoked to justify them;

with the relevant provisions of international law, including international standards of

1996;

4. Also reiterates its call upon all States, with the aim of enhancing the
efficient implementation of relevant legal instruments, to intensify, as and where
appropriate, the exchange of information on facts related to terrorism and, in so
doing, to avoid the dissemination of inaccurate or unverified information;
