 The General Assembly, 

 Reiterating that the cessation of nuclear-weapon test explosions or any other 

nuclear explosions constitutes an effective nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation 

measure, and convinced that this is a meaningful step in the realization of a 

systematic process for achieving nuclear disarmament,   

 Recalling that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, adopted by the 

General Assembly by its resolution 50/245 of 10 September 1996, was opened for 

signature on 24 September 1996,  

 Stressing that a universal and effectively verifiable Treaty constitutes a 

fundamental instrument in the field of nuclear disarmament and non -proliferation 

and will be a major contribution to international peace and security,  

 Stressing also the vital importance and urgency of achieving the entry into 

force of the Treaty, as noted also in Security Council resolution 2310 (2016) of 

23 September 2016, and affirming its resolute determination, 21 years after the 

Treaty was opened for signature, to achieve its entry into force,   

 Encouraged by the signing of the Treaty by 183 States, including 41 of the 44  

whose ratification is needed for its entry into force, and welcoming the ratification

its entry into force, among which there are 3 nuclear -weapon States,  

 Recalling its resolution 71/86 of 5 December 2016,  

 Recalling also the adoption by consensus of the conclusions and 

recommendations for follow-on actions of the 2010 Review Conference of the 

Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,
1
 in which the 

Conference, inter alia, reaffirmed the vital importance of the entry into force of the 

Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as a core element of the international 

nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and included specific actions to 

be taken in support of the entry into force of the Treaty,   

 Welcoming the 20 Years CTBT Ministerial Meeting, held in Vienna on 13 and 

14 June 2016, which brought together leaders and policymakers to review and 

reinvigorate efforts to achieve the entry into force of the Treaty,  

 Welcoming also the Final Declaration adopted by the tenth Conference on 

Facilitating the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear -Test-Ban Treaty, 

held in New York on 20 September 2017, convened pursuant to article XIV of the 

Treaty, and recalling the Joint Ministerial Statement on the Comprehensive Nuclear -

Test-Ban Treaty, adopted at the ministerial meeting held in New York on 

21 September 2016,
2
  

 Noting that the group of eminent persons, established to support the 

article XIV process, met in Vienna on 14 June 2016, where they called for new 

thinking and further engagement with the leadership of the remaining eight annex 2 

States with the aim of facilitating their respective ratification processes,   

 Noting also the establishment in early 2016 of a youth group open to all 

students and young graduates who are directing their careers towards contributing to 

global peace and security and who wish to actively engage in promoting the Treaty 

and its verification regime,  

 Welcoming continuing progress in the development of the Treaty’s verification 

regime, which advances the Treaty’s primary non-proliferation and disarmament 

objective, including the completion in June 2017 of the hydroacoustic part of the 

International Monitoring System,  

 Recognizing the civil and scientific benefits provided by the CTBT global 

monitoring system,  

 1. Stresses the vital importance and urgency of signature and ratification, 

without delay and without conditions, in order to achieve the earliest entry into 

force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty;
3
  

 2. Welcomes the contributions by the signatory States to the work of the 

Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization,

force, in accordance with article IV of the Treaty, and encourages their continuation;   

 3. Underlines the need to maintain momentum towards completion of all 

elements of the verification regime;
