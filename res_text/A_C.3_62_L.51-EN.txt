 The General Assembly, 

 Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 the International 
Covenants on Human Rights2 and other applicable human rights instruments, 

 Reaffirming that all States have an obligation to promote and protect human

 Mindful that Belarus is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights2 and the first Optional Protocol thereto,3 the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,2 the International Convention on the

 Recalling Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2003/14 of 17 April 
2003,10 2004/14 of 15 April 200411 and 2005/13 of 14 April 2005,12 Human Rights 
Council decision 1/102 of 30 June 2006,13 and its resolution 61/175 of 19 December 
2006, 

 Concerned that the presidential election of 19 March 2006 was severely 
flawed due to arbitrary use of state power and fell significantly short of Belarus’ 
commitments at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to hold a 
free and fair election, that the Government did not take measures to ensure that the 
local elections of 14 January 2007 met international standards and that the situation 
of human rights in Belarus in 2007 continued to significantly deteriorate, as 
documented in the reports of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human 
Rights of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the report of 
the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus,14 dated 12 June 
2007, which found that systematic violations of human rights continue to take place 
in Belarus, 

 Disappointed that the Belarusian authorities again failed to create conditions 
for the Belarusian people to freely express their will during local elections on 
14 January 2007 by denying the basic rights of freedom of assembly and 
association, as well as with the lack of progress made by the Government of Belarus 
in addressing noted shortfalls, 

 1. Expresses deep concern: 

 (a) About the continued use of the criminal justice system to silence political 
opposition and human rights defenders, including through arbitrary detention, lack 
of due process and closed political trials of leading opposition figures and human 
rights defenders; 

 (b) About the failure of the Government of Belarus to cooperate fully with 
all the mechanisms of the Human Rights Council, in particular with the Special 
Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in Belarus, while noting the serious 
concern relating to the continued and systematic violations of human rights in 
Belarus and the further erosion of the democratic process expressed by seven 
independent human rights experts of the United Nations in a statement issued on 
29 March 2006; 

 (c) That in spite of detailed recommendations by the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe and dialogue between the Government and the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe following previous elections,

and despite calls from the General Assembly to adopt the recommendations of the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe following the flawed 
presidential elections in 2006, Belarus again failed to meet its commitments to hold 
free and fair elections during municipal elections in January 2007, including by 
using intimidation and the arbitrary application of registration standards to exclude 
opposition candidates, severely restricting the access of registered candidates to 
voters and the mass media, through routine harassment, the detention and arrest of 
political and civil society activists, the negative portrayal in the State media of 
opposition candidates and activists, including human rights defenders, and 
preventing access by independent local observers to polling stations; 

 (d) About the continued use of the arbitrary application of registration 
standards to prevent non-governmental organizations from operating, including the 
use of the arbitrary denial of leases and evictions to prevent organizations from 
acquiring valid addressees; 

 (e) About the continued harassment and detention of Belarusian journalists 
and the suspension and banning of independent media covering local opposition 
demonstrations, and that senior officials of the Government of Belarus were 
implicated in the enforced disappearance and/or summary execution of three 
political opponents of the incumbent authorities in 1999 and of a journalist in 2000 
and in the continuing investigatory cover-up, as documented in the report adopted in 
resolution 1371 of 28 April 2004 by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of 
Europe,15 and that the Government of Belarus has ignored calls of that body to 
account for their disappearance; 

 (f) About the failure of the Belarusian authorities to heed calls to reinstate 
the teaching licence of the European Humanities University in Minsk and about the 
increasing harassment of its students while the university operates in exile; 

 (g) About continued persistent reports of harassment and closure of 
non-governmental organizations, national minority organizations, independent 
media outlets, religious groups, opposition political parties, independent trade 
unions, and independent youth and student organizations, and the harassment and 
prosecution of individuals, including students and their relatives, engaged in the 
promotion and protection of human rights, the rule of law and democracy, especially 
those students returning to Belarus; 

 2. Urges the Government of Belarus: 

 (a) To release immediately and unconditionally all individuals detained for 
politically motivated reasons and other individuals detained for exercising or 
promoting human rights; 

 (b) To cease politically motivated prosecution, harassment and intimidation 
of political opponents, pro-democracy activists and human rights defenders, 
independent media, national minority activists, religious organizations, educational 
institutions and civil society actors, and to cease the harassment of students and 
create the conditions whereby they can continue their studies in Belarus; 

 (c) To bring the electoral process and legislative framework into line with 
international standards, especially those of the Organization for Security and

Cooperation in Europe, to demonstrate such commitment through the parliamentary 
elections due in 2008 and to rectify the shortcomings of the electoral process, 
identified by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights in its report 
of 7 June 2006, including election laws and practices that restrict campaigning 
opportunities for de facto opposition candidates, the arbitrary application of 
electoral laws, including with regard to the registration of candidates, obstruction of 
the right of access to the media, biased presentation of the issues by the State media 
and the falsification of vote counts; 

 (d) To respect the rights to freedom of speech, assembly and association; 

 (e) To suspend from their duties officials implicated in any case of enforced 
disappearance, summary execution and torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, pending investigation of those cases, and to 
ensure that all necessary measures are taken to investigate fully and impartially such 
cases and to bring the alleged perpetrators to justice before an independent tribunal, 
and, if found guilty, to ensure that they are punished in accordance with the 
international human rights obligations of Belarus; 

 (f) To uphold the right to freedom of religion or belief, including the ability 
to maintain communications with individuals and communities in matters of religion 
and belief at the national and international levels; 

 (g) To investigate and hold accountable those responsible for the 
mistreatment, arbitrary arrest and incarceration of human rights defenders and 
members of the political opposition; 

 (h) To carry out the recommendations of the International Labour 
Organization Commission with regard to respecting core labour rights of freedom of 
association for workers; 

 (i) To carry out all other steps called for by the Commission on Human 
Rights in its resolution 2005/13,12 as well as General Assembly resolution 61/175; 

 3. Insists that the Government of Belarus cooperate fully with the Human 
Rights Council and its mechanisms, as well as with all mechanisms of the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
