Renewed determination towards the total elimination
of nuclear weapons

The General Assembly,

Recalling, on the sixtieth anniversary of the atomic bombings in Hiroshima
and Nagasaki, Japan, the need for all States to take further practical steps and
effective measures towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons, with a view to
achieving a peaceful and safe world free of nuclear weapons, and renewing the
determination to do so,

Noting that the ultimate objective of the efforts of States in the disarmament
process is general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international
control,

Recalling its resolution 59/76 of 3 December 2004,

Convinced that every effort should be made to avoid nuclear war and nuclear
terrorism,

Reaffirming the crucial importance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons1 as the cornerstone of the international nuclear disarmament and
non-proliferation regime, and expressing regret over the lack of agreement on
substantive issues at the 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as well as over the elimination of references
to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation in the 2005 World Summit Outcome,2

Recalling the decisions and the resolution of the 1995 Review and Extension
Conference of the Parties to the Treaty3 and the Final Document of the 2000 Review
Conference of the Parties to the Treaty,4

Recognizing that the enhancement of international peace and security and the
promotion of nuclear disarmament are mutually reinforcing,

Reaffirming that further advancement in nuclear disarmament will contribute
to consolidating the international regime for nuclear non-proliferation and thereby
ensuring international peace and security,

Expressing deep concern regarding the growing dangers posed by the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, inter alia, nuclear weapons, including
that caused by proliferation networks,

Welcoming the Final Declaration of the fourth Conference on Facilitating the
Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,5 convened in New
York in September 2005,

1. Reaffirms the importance of all States parties to the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons1 complying with their obligations under all the
articles of the Treaty, and stresses the importance of an effective Treaty review
process;

2. Also reaffirms the importance of the universality of the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and calls upon States not parties to the
Treaty to accede to it as non-nuclear-weapon States without delay and without
conditions, and pending their accession to refrain from acts that would defeat the
objective and purpose of the Treaty as well as to take practical steps in support of
the Treaty;

3. Encourages further steps leading to nuclear disarmament, to which all
States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons are
committed under article VI of the Treaty, including deeper reductions in all types of
nuclear weapons, and emphasizes the importance of applying irreversibility and
verifiability, as well as increased transparency in a way that promotes international
stability and undiminished security for all, in the process of working towards the
elimination of nuclear weapons;

4. Also encourages the Russian Federation and the United States of
America to implement fully the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Reductions,6 which
should serve as a step for further nuclear disarmament, and to undertake nuclear
arms reductions beyond those provided for by the Treaty, while welcoming the
progress made by nuclear-weapon States, including the Russian Federation and the
United States, on nuclear arms reductions;

5. Further encourages States to continue to pursue efforts, within the
framework of international cooperation, contributing to the reduction of nuclear-
weapons-related materials;

6. Calls for the nuclear-weapon States to further reduce the operational
status of nuclear weapons systems in ways that promote international stability and
security;

7. Stresses the necessity of a diminishing role for nuclear weapons in
security policies to minimize the risk that these weapons will ever be used and to
facilitate the process of their total elimination, in a way that promotes international
stability, and based on the principle of undiminished security for all;

8. Urges all States that have not yet done so to sign and ratify the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty7 at the earliest opportunity with a view to
its early entry into force, stresses the importance of maintaining existing
moratoriums on nuclear-weapon test explosions pending the entry into force of the
Treaty, and reaffirms the importance of the continued development of the

international monitoring system, which will be required to provide assurance of
compliance with the Treaty;

negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty and its early conclusion, and calls

Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to declare moratoriums on the production of
fissile material for any nuclear weapons pending the entry into force of the Treaty;

10. Calls upon all States to redouble their efforts to prevent and curb the
proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and their means of
delivery;

the universalization of the International Atomic Energy Agency comprehensive
safeguards agreements and Model Protocol Additional to the Agreement(s) between
State(s) and the International Atomic Energy Agency for the Application of
Safeguards approved by the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy
Agency on 15 May 1997,8 and the full implementation of Security Council
resolution 1540 (2004) of 28 April 2004;

12. Encourages all States to undertake concrete activities to implement, as
appropriate, the recommendations in the report of the Secretary-General on the

information on efforts they have been undertaking to this end;
