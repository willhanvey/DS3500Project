all its subsequent relevant resolutions,  

 Recalling its resolutions 2292 (2016), 2357 (2017), 2420 (2018) and 2473 

(2019) concerning the strict implementation of the arms embargo on the high seas off 

the coast of Libya,

Libya convened on 19 January 2020 and recognising the important role of 

neighbouring countries and regional organisations,  

 Mindful of its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace 

and security under the Charter of the United Nations,

constitutes one of the most serious threats to peace and security,  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 1.  Decides to extend the authorizations as set out in resolution 2473 for a 

further 12 months from the date of this resolution;  

 2.  Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Security Council within 

eleven months of the adoption of this resolution on its implementation;  

 3.  Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
