 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 1970 (XVIII) of 16 December 1963, in which it 
requested the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation 
of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and 
Peoples to study the information transmitted to the Secretary-General in accordance 
with Article 73 e of the Charter of the United Nations and to take such information

of the Declaration, contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 
14 December 1960, 

 Recalling also its resolution 67/125 of 18 December 2012, in which it

 Stressing the importance of timely transmission by the administering Powers of 
adequate information under Article 73 e of the Charter, in particular in relation to the 
preparation by the Secretariat of the working papers on the Territories concerned, 

 Having examined the report of the Secretary-General,1 

 1. Reaffirms that, in the absence of a decision by the General Assembly itself 
that a Non-Self-Governing Territory has attained a full measure of self-government 
in terms of Chapter XI of the Charter of the United Nations, the administering 
Power concerned should continue to transmit information under Article 73 e of the 
Charter with respect to that Territory; 

 2. Requests the administering Powers concerned, in accordance with their 
Charter obligations, to transmit or continue to transmit regularly to the Secretary-
General for information purposes, subject to such limitation as security and 
constitutional considerations may require, statistical and other information of a 
technical nature relating to economic, social and educational conditions in the 
Territories for which they are respectively responsible, as well as the fullest possible 
information on political and constitutional developments in the Territories 
concerned, including the constitution, legislative act or executive order providing 
for the government of the Territory and the constitutional relationship of the 
Territory to the administering Power, within a maximum period of six months 
following the expiration of the administrative year in those Territories;
