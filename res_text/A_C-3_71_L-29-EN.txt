inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, and to settle their international 

disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and securi ty 

and justice are not endangered, 

 Acknowledging that the fuller development of a culture of peace is integrally 

linked to the realization of the right of all peoples, including those living under

Covenants on Human Rights, as well as in the Declaration on the Granting of 

Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples contained in General Assembly

 Convinced that any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the 

national unity and territorial integrity of a State or country or at its political 

independence is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter,

security of States, hinder international cooperation and aim at the destruction of 

human rights, fundamental freedoms and the democratic bases of society, and 

reaffirming that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of 

their motivations, whenever and by whomsoever committed,

compliance with the obligations of States under international law, including 

international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, as well a s those enshrined 

in the Charter, 

 Urging all States that have not yet done so to consider, as a matter of priority, 

becoming parties to international instruments related to terrorism,  

 Reaffirming that the promotion and protection of human rights for all and the 

rule of law are essential to the fight against terrorism, and recognizing that effective 

counter-terrorism measures and the protection of human rights are not conflicting 

goals, but are complementary and mutually reinforcing,  

 Reaffirming also the determination of the peoples of the United Nations, as 

expressed in the Preamble to the Charter, to save succeeding generations from the 

scourge of war, to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, to promote social 

progress and better standards of life in larger freedom, and to practice tolerance and 

live together in peace with one another as good neighbours,
