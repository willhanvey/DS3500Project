America: draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling all its relevant resolutions including resolution 1781 of 15 October 
2007 (S/RES/1781), 

 Welcoming the reports of the Secretary-General on the activities of the United 
Nations Observer Mission in Georgia of 23 January 2008 (S/2008/38) and 2 April 
2008 (S/2008/219), 

 Reiterating the importance of maintaining the separation of forces and the 
preservation of the ceasefire, 

 Supporting the sustained efforts of the Secretary-General and of his Special 
Representative with the assistance of the Group of Friends of the Secretary-General 
as well as the Russian Federation in its capacity as facilitator and of the OSCE, 
underlining the increased importance of the meetings in the Geneva format as the 
forum for meaningful political dialogue and welcoming the Georgian and Abkhaz 
renewed commitment to this process, 

 Noting that whereas the United Nations and the Group of Friends of the 
Secretary-General will continue to support the process of conflict resolution 
between the Georgian and Abkhaz sides, the primary responsibility to make use of 
this support and to implement measures to advance the process, in particular 
measures to build confidence, remains with both sides, 

 Regretting the continued lack of progress in implementing confidence-building 
measures, and underlining the importance of constructive goodwill between the 
sides and respect for each other’s concerns, 

 Stressing the importance of close and effective cooperation between UNOMIG 
and the CIS peacekeeping force as they currently play an important stabilizing role 
in the conflict zone, and recalling that a lasting and comprehensive settlement of the 
conflict will require appropriate security guarantees, 

 Stressing that economic development is urgently required in Abkhazia, 
Georgia, to improve the livelihoods of the communities affected by the conflict, in 
particular refugees and internally displaced persons,
