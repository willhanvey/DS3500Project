and international economic, financial and regulatory environment for the means of 

implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including financial

lending framework of the International Monetary Fund through, inter alia, 

streamlined conditions and flexible instruments, such as the precautionary and

 15. Also encourages multilateral development banks, within their respective 

mandates, to continue to expand technical assistance, disseminate and share their

quota formula, as a basis for a realignment of quota shares, will result in increased 

shares for dynamic economies in line with their relative positions in the world 

economy and hence likely in the share of emerging market and developing countries

in international economic decision-making, norm-setting and global economic 

governance;

knowledge and technologies globally, as well as capacity-building, are also critical, 

and commits to pursuing policy coherence and an enabling environment for 

sustainable development at all levels and by all actors, and to reinvigorating the 

Global Partnership for Sustainable Development;  

 21. Recommits to a redoubling of its efforts to substantially reduce illicit

combating tax evasion and corruption through strengthened national regulation and 

increased international cooperation;  

 22. Recognizes the role of special drawing rights as an international reserve 

asset, acknowledges that special drawing rights allocations helped to supplement 

international reserves in response to the world financial and economic crisis, thus 

contributing to the stability of the international financial system and global economic

intermediation, markets for derivatives, securities lending and repurchase

big-to-fail” financial institutions and to addressing cross-border elements in effective 

resolution of troubled, systemically important financial institutions;  

 24. Reiterates that effective, inclusive multilateral surveillance should be at 

the centre of crisis prevention efforts, stresses the need to continue to strengthen 

surveillance of the financial policies of countries, and in this regard notes the current 

efforts to update the surveillance approach of the International Monetary Fund to 

better integrate bilateral and multilateral surveillance, along with cross-border and 

cross-sectoral linkages with macroeconomic and macroprudential policies, while 

paying closer attention to the spillover effects from national economic and financial 

policies onto the global economy;  

 25. Also reiterates the need to resolve to reduce mechanistic reliance on credit-

rating agency assessments, including in regulations and to promote increased 

competition as well as measures to avoid conflict of interest in the provision of credit 

ratings; 

 26. Invites the international financial and banking institutions to continue to 

enhance the transparency and analytical rigour of risk-rating mechanisms, noting that 

sovereign risk assessments should maximize the use of objective and transparent 

parameters, which can be facilitated by high-quality data and analysis, and 

encourages relevant institutions, including the United Nations Conference on Trade 

and Development, to continue their work on the issue, including the potential impact 

of the role played by private credit rating agencies on the development prospects of 

developing countries, in accordance with their mandates;  

 27. Welcomes efforts by new development banks to develop safeguard systems 

in open consultation with stakeholders on the basis of established international 



A/C.2/73/L.12/Rev.1 
 

 

18-20273 8/8

countries;
