69/186 of 18 December 2014 and 71/187 of 19 December 2016 on the question of a 

moratorium on the use of the death penalty, in which the General Assembly called 

upon States that still maintain the death penalty to establish a moratorium on 

executions with a view to abolishing it,  

 Recalling further all relevant decisions and resolutions of the Human Rights 

Council, the most recent of which was resolution 36/17 of 29 September 2017,5  

 Mindful that any miscarriage or failure of justice in the implementation of the 

death penalty is irreversible and irreparable,  

 Convinced that a moratorium on the use of the death penalty contributes to 

respect for human dignity and to the enhancement and progressive development of 

human rights, and considering that there is no conclusive evidence of the deterrent 

value of the death penalty, 

 Noting ongoing local and national debates and regional initiatives on the death 

penalty, as well as the readiness of an increasing number of Member States to make 

available to the public information on the use of the death penalty, and also, in this 

regard, the decision by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 26/2 of 26 June 

20146 to convene biennial high-level panel discussions in order to further exchange 

views on the question of the death penalty,  

 Recognizing the role of national human rights institutions in contributing to 

ongoing local and national debates and regional initiatives on the death penalty,  

 Welcoming the considerable movement towards the abolition of the death 

penalty globally and the fact that many States are applying a moratorium, including 

long-standing moratoriums, either in law or in practice, on the use of the death 

penalty,  

 Emphasizing the need to ensure that persons facing the death penalty have 

access to justice without discrimination, including access to legal counsel, and that 

they are treated with humanity and with respect for their inherent dignity and in 

compliance with their rights under international human rights law,  

 Noting with deep concern that, as shown in recent reports of the Secretary-

General, frequently, poor and economically vulnerable persons, foreign nationals, 

persons exercising their human rights and persons belonging to religious or ethnic 

minorities are disproportionately represented among those sentenced to the death 

penalty,7  

 Noting the technical cooperation among Member States, as well as the role of 

relevant United Nations entities and human rights mechanisms, in supporting State 

efforts to establish moratoriums on the death penalty,  

 Bearing in mind the work of special procedures mandate holders who have 

addressed human rights issues related to the death penalty within the framework of 

their respective mandates, 

 1. Expresses its deep concern about the continued application of the death 

penalty;  

 2. Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of 

resolution 71/187 and the recommendations contained therein;8

 3. Also welcomes the steps taken by some States to reduce the number of 

offences for which the death penalty may be imposed, as well as steps taken to limit 

its application;  

 4. Further welcomes initiatives and political leadership encouraging national 

discussions and debates on the possibility of moving away from capital puni shment 

through domestic decision-making;  

 5. Welcomes the decisions made by an increasing number of States from all 

regions, at all levels of government, to apply a moratorium on executions, followed 

in many cases by the abolition of the death penalty;  

 6. Calls upon all States:  

 (a) To respect international standards that provide safeguards guaranteeing 

protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, in particular the minimum 

standards, as set out in the annex to Economic and Social Council resolution 1984/50 

of 25 May 1984, as well as to provide the Secretary-General with information in this 

regard;  

 (b) To comply with their obligations under article 36 of the 1963 Vienna 

Convention on Consular Relations,9 particularly the right to receive information on 

consular assistance;  

 (c) To make available relevant information, disaggregated by sex, age, 

nationality and race, as applicable, and other applicable criteria, with regard to their 

use of the death penalty, inter alia, the number of persons sentenced to death, the 

number of persons on death row and the number of executions carried out, the number 

of death sentences reversed or commuted on appeal and information on any scheduled 

execution, which can contribute to possible informed and transparent national and 

international debates, including on the obligations of States pertaining to the use of 

the death penalty;  

 (d) To progressively restrict the use of the death penalty and not to impose 

capital punishment for offences committed by persons below 18 years of age, on 

pregnant women or on persons with mental or intellectual disabilities;  

 (e) To reduce the number of offences for which the death penalty may be 

imposed, including by considering removing the mandatory application of the death 

penalty;  

 (f) To ensure that those facing the death penalty can exercise their right to 

apply for pardon or commutation of their death sentence by ensuring that clemency 

procedures are fair and transparent and that prompt information is provided at all 

stages of the process; 

 (g) To ensure that the death penalty is not applied on the basis of 

discriminatory laws or as a result of discriminatory or arbitrary application of the law;  

 (h) To establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the 

death penalty;  

 7. Calls upon States which have abolished the death penalty not to 

reintroduce it, and encourages them to share their experience in this regard;  

 8. Encourages States which have a moratorium to maintain it and to share 

their experience in this regard;
