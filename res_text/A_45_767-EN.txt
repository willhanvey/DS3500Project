III. RECOMMENDATION OF THE FIRST COMMITTEE

7. The First Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the
Following draft resolution:

The General As.g_embly,

Recalling that in its resolution 2286 (XXII! of 5 December  1967 it welcomed
with special satisfaction the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in
Latin America I/ as an event of historic significance in the efforts to prevent the
proliferation of nuclear weapons and to promote international peace and security,

Recallina also its various resolutions concerning the signature and
rati f icat ion of  Addit ional  Protocol  I  o f  the Treaty for  the Prohibit ion of  Nuclaiir
Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco),

Takina into account that within the zone of application of the Treaty, to
which twenty-three sovereign States are already parties, there ar’o some territories
that, in spite  of  not  being sovereign pol i t ical  entities, are nevertheless in a

21 United Nations Trre.&ty  Series,  vol.  634, No. 9068.

position to receive the benefits deriving from the Treaty through its Additional
Protocol I, to which the four States that ddure or de facto are internationally
responsible for those territories may become parties,

CcxuLdar!ng that it is not fair that the peoples of some CL those territories
are deprived of such benefit.8 without being given the opportunity to express their
opinion in this connection,

Becalllnq  that three of the States to which Additional Protocol I is open -
the United iiinq*lom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Kingdom of the
Netherlands and the United States of America - became parties to the Protocol in
196. 1971 and 1981 respectively,

1, De.plores_oncc?git_in that the signature of Additional Protocol I by
France, which took place on 2 March 1979, has not yet been followed by the
corresponding ratif  ication, notwithstanding the time elapsed and the pressing
invitations that the General Assembly has addressed to it:

2. Qnc.g_more-  urges France not to delay any further such ratification, which
has been requested so many times and which appears all the more advisable, since
France is the only one of the four States to which the ?rotocol  is open that is not
yet  party  to  i t ;

3. Decides to includa in the provisional agenda of its forty-sixth session
an item entitled “Implementation of General Assembly resolution 45/- concerning
the siqnature and ratification of Additional Protocol I of the Treaty for the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of
T la te l o l c o ) “ .
