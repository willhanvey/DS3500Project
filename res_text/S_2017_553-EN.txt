  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland:  

draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming all its previous resolutions and presidential statements concerning 

the situation in Sudan and underlining the importance of full compliance with these,  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, unity, independence and 

territorial integrity of Sudan and its determination to work with the Government of 

Sudan, in full respect of its sovereignty, to assist in tackling the various challenges 

in Sudan, 

 Recalling the importance of the principles of the peaceful settlement of 

international disputes, good neighbourliness, non-interference and cooperation in 

the relations among States in the region,  

 Reaffirming the basic principles of peacekeeping, including consent of the 

parties, impartiality and non-use of force, except in self-defence and defence of the 

mandate, and recognizing that the mandate of each peacekeeping mission is specific 

to the country concerned, and recalling S/PRST/2015/22, 

 Recalling all its relevant resolutions on women, peace and security, on 

children and armed conflicts, on the protection of humanitarian and United Nations 

personnel, and on the protection of civilians in armed conflicts,  

 Underlining, without prejudice to the Security Council’s primary 

responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, the 

importance of the partnership between the United Nations and the African Union, 

consistent with Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations, with regard to the 

maintenance of peace and security in Africa, particularly in Sudan, 

 

  Current situation 
 

 Welcoming the reduction of military confrontations between Government 

forces and rebel groups and the announcement of unilateral cessation of hostilities 

by the Government of Sudan until June 2017 and by the Sudan Liberation Army 

Minni Minnawi (SLA/MM) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM)/Gibril 

until November 2017, 

 Expressing concern at the presence of Darfur armed movements in conflict 

areas outside Sudan; expressing further concern at the recent clashes in north and 

east Darfur, condemning the violations of unilateral cessations of hostilities and

S/2017/553 
 

 

17-10874 2/15 

 

urging all parties to abide by their unilateral cessation of hostilities and to 

immediately agree to a permanent ceasefire,  

 Reiterating its demand that all parties to the conflict in Darfur immediately 

end violence, including attacks on civilians, peacekeepers and humanitarian 

personnel, 

 Welcoming the overall improvement in security conditions, expressing concern 

that the overall security situation in Darfur remains precarious due to activities of 

militia groups, the incorporation of some militias into auxiliary units of the 

Government of Sudan forces, which have become key actors in the conflict between 

the Government of Sudan and the armed movements and in inter-communal conflict 

and further exacerbate insecurity and threats against civilians in Darfur, the 

prevalence of weapons, which contributes to large scale violence and is 

undermining the establishment of the rule of law, acts of banditry and crimina lity 

and the absence of rule of law,  

 Noting that inter-communal conflicts remain one of the main sources of 

violence in Darfur and expressing concern at ongoing inter-communal conflict over 

land, access to resources, migration issues and tribal rivalries,  including with the 

involvement of paramilitary units and tribal militias, as well as at the persistence of 

attacks against civilians, sexual and gender-based violence and that crucial 

grievances that caused the conflict remain unaddressed,  

 Welcoming the increased presence of the Sudanese Police in Darfur, as 

compared to previous years, urging the Government of Sudan to continue to 

increase the number and presence of police in Darfur, underlining the importance of 

effective police and rule of law institutions to establishing a protective environment 

and combating impunity in line with international human rights standards and 

noting that whilst the Sudanese Police have increased their presence in Darfur, they 

lack capacity to fully cover all the localities and protect communities and that the 

presence and capacity of justice and corrections institutions across Darfur is limited 

and impunity for serious crimes remains widespread, acknowledging efforts by the 

local governments to restore law and order through the deployment of additional 

police, corrections and judicial human and material resources across Darfur, noting 

that these efforts should be consolidated and expanded to enhance the protective 

environment for the civilian population, without any discr imination, particularly 

with respect to violations and abuses of women’s rights and sexual and gender -

based violence as well as violations and abuses against children and recalling the 

importance of national political leadership towards that goal,  

 Emphasising that those responsible for violations of international humanitarian 

law and violations and abuses of human rights must be held accountable and that the 

Government of Sudan bears the primary responsibility to protect civilians within its 

territory and subject to its jurisdiction, including protection from crimes against 

humanity and war crimes, 

 Recalling its resolution 2117 (2013) and expressing concern at the threat to 

peace and security in Darfur arising from the illicit transfer, destabilising 

accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons, and the continued threats 

to civilians posed by unexploded ordnance,  

 

  Humanitarian situation and displacement 
 

 Whilst welcoming the reduction in the levels of new displacement in the first 

quarter of 2017, expressing deep concern at the increase in displacement in 2016, 

when armed conflict triggered the displacement of over 140,000 people, and of an 

additional 40,000 who were displaced and subsequently returned to their places of

origin, with thousands more reported to be displaced but which could not be verified 

due to access constraints, increasing the estimated total number of long -term 

internally-displaced persons (IDPs) in Darfur to 2.7 million and a total number of 

people in need of humanitarian assistance of 2.1 million,  

 Calling on donors, the regional authorities in Darfur and the Government of 

Sudan to provide the financial resources necessary to reach those in need, inclu ding 

to the United Nations Country Team, and to undertake development activities in 

support of the transition to peacebuilding, and urging the Government of Sudan and 

the local authorities to ensure there is an environment conducive to the provision of 

such activities, including improving access for development actors,  

 Noting some improvements in the protective environment, expressing concern 

that IDPs continue to face grave security challenges including being killed, raped, 

or harassed as they conduct life-sustaining activities outside the camps and at the 

increase in human rights violations and abuses in 2016 and the first quarter in 2017 

and the worrying levels of conflict-related sexual and gender based violence and 

grave violations against children,  

 Underlining the importance of the Government of Sudan addressing the root 

causes of conflict and extending state authority, including through the strengthening 

of the rule of law and respect for human rights, throughout Darfur in order to make 

the transition to peacebuilding possible, 

 Expressing concern that the humanitarian and security situation, as well as the 

lack of capacity of the regional authorities in Darfur, hinder the transition from 

relief to stabilisation and development activities, urging the Government of Sudan, 

with the support of interested donors, to ensure that the Darfur Peace Follow -up 

Office is properly resourced in order to continue implementation of the work of the 

former Darfur Regional Authority and the Commissions, urging donors and the 

Government of Sudan to honour their pledges and fulfil their obligations in a timely 

manner, including those commitments made at the conference in Doha in April 

2013, affirming that development can support a lasting peace in Darfur, and calling 

on donors to support the Darfur Development Strategy and ensure their funding is 

adequately aligned to Darfur’s current development needs,  

 Recalling the commitments made by the Government of Sudan and other 

signatories to the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD) to ensure the 

unimpeded access of humanitarian assistance to the population in need and the 

protection of humanitarian workers and their operations in areas under their control, 

as well as to guarantee the United Nation-African Union Mission in Darfur 

(UNAMID) unimpeded freedom of movement in all areas and at all times in Darfur 

in the exercise of its mandate, and further recalling the role of the Implementation 

Follow-up Commission (IFC) in assessing the implementation of the DDPD,  

 

  Operational Challenges 
 

 Welcoming the improvement in freedom of movement for UNAMID and 

humanitarian personnel as well as in the issuance of visas for UNAMID staff and 

the processing of UNAMID containers, but expressing concern that restrictions 

remain in place, including restrictions from the Government of Sudan on the 

conduct of night patrols all over Darfur and restrictions preventing UNAMID from 

reaching areas where there are instances of inter-communal conflict in a timely 

fashion, and that obstacles, including bureaucratic obstacles, imposed on UNAMID 

continue to jeopardise its ability to deliver on its mandate, including visa 

restrictions targeted at some elements of UNAMID, particularly the human rights 

section, and ongoing delays in the processing of UNAMID containers, recognising 

the Government of Sudan’s commitment to cooperate with UNAMID and 



S/2017/553 
 

 

17-10874 4/15 

 

humanitarian personnel on all logistical issues and calling on the Government of 

Sudan to continuously honour its commitment in full to ensure that humanitarian 

personnel and UNAMID can operate in support of addressing basic needs,  

 

  Political situation 
 

 Reiterating that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Darfur, and 

that an inclusive political settlement is essential to re -establishing peace, and 

underscoring the importance of fully addressing the root causes of the conflict, 

including management of land, water and other resources, and the perceived bias by 

the Government of Sudan towards one group over another, in the search for a 

sustainable peace, which should rapidly deliver real benefits for the Darfuri people, 

in this regard reiterating its support for the DDPD as a viable framework for the 

peace process in Darfur, and for its accelerated implementation, as well as the 

implementation of the AU High-Level Implementation Panel (AU-HIP) Roadmap 

and mediated peace talks, 

 Welcoming the signing of the AU-HIP Roadmap by the Government of Sudan 

and the armed movements, urging all parties to make immediate progress on the 

implementation of the Roadmap, including the signing of cessation of hostilities and 

humanitarian assistance agreements among the parties consistent with the first phase 

of the Roadmap, and further urging non-signatory groups to sign it without delay,  

 Acknowledging the progress of the Sudan National Dialogue in October 2016, 

including the adoption of a national document and the subsequent appointment of 

the First Vice President as Prime Minister and formation of a Government of 

National Unity, and noting that major opposition groups in Sudan have not yet 

participated in the National Dialogue out of concerns that the process being 

conducted was taking place in an adverse political and human rights climate, noting 

that the Government of Sudan has expressed openness for outstanding opposit ion 

groups to join the National Dialogue process and encouraging the Government of 

Sudan to create a more inclusive environment that would enable outstanding 

opposition groups to contribute to this process, including by contributing to 

modalities on implementing the recommendations agreed in the national document 

and to join the National Dialogue process in the drafting of a new constitution,  

 Noting that UNAMID’s ability to facilitate progress in implementation of the 

DDPD is hampered by delays and the absence of an inclusive political settlement 

between the Government of Sudan and non-signatory armed movements, 

 Noting that local dispute resolution mechanisms play an important role in 

preventing and resolving inter-communal conflict, including conflict over natural 

resources, urging an intensification of effective efforts to prevent local disputes 

leading to violence, with its corresponding impact on the local civilian populations, 

acknowledging the efforts of Sudanese authorities, with the support of UNAMID, 

and efforts of the United Nations Country Team, particularly through the Darfur 

Community Peace and Stability Fund (DCPSF), in this regard, welcoming the 

encouraging conclusion of several inter-communal peace agreements, with support 

from UNAMID and the United Nations Country Team, and urging their continued 

work in collaboration with the Government of Sudan to find sustainable solutions to 

these conflicts, 

 Welcoming regional and other initiatives, undertaken in close interaction with 

the Government of Sudan, to address the root causes of the conflict in Darfur and to 

promote a sustainable peace, commending the efforts of the AU-HIP, led by 

President Thabo Mbeki and the efforts of the Joint Special Representative (JSR) to 

secure peace, stability and security in Darfur, including through support to 



 
S/2017/553 

 

5/15 17-10874 

 

international, regional and national efforts to revitalise the peace process and 

increase its inclusiveness, 

 Calling on all parties to comply with their obligations under international 

human rights law and international humanitarian law, stressing the importance that 

the Council attaches to ending impunity including through ensuring accountability 

and bringing to justice the perpetrators of crimes, including sexual and gender -based 

violence, committed by all parties in Darfur, urging the Government of Sudan to 

comply with its obligations in this respect, welcoming the ongoing investigations by 

the Special Prosecutor for Darfur appointed by the Government of Sudan, 

particularly with respect to cases of sexual and gender based violence, and stressing 

the need for further progress in this regard with respect to perpetrators on all sides, 

reiterating the call for swift progress on the draft Memorandum of Understanding 

providing for UNAMID and African Union observation of the proceedings of the 

Special Court, and calling on the Government of Sudan swiftly to investigate 

attacks against UNAMID, and to bring the perpetrators to just ice, 

 Reaffirming its concern over the negative effect of instability in Darfur on the 

stability of Sudan as a whole as well as the region, and encouraging cooperation 

between regional state actors to address cross-border issues, such as weapons 

smuggling, in order to achieve peace and stability in Darfur and the wider region, 

and recalling in this regard the arms embargo as contained in paragraph 9 of 

resolution 1556 (2004) and paragraph 7 of resolution 1591 (2005), as updated in 

paragraph 9 of resolution 1945 (2010) and paragraph 4 of resolution 2035 (2012), 

 Commending the efforts of UNAMID towards promoting peace and stability in 

Darfur, and reiterating its full support for UNAMID, 

 Welcoming the Special Report of the Secretary-General and the Chairperson of 

the African Union Commission of 18 May 2017 (S/2017/437) (the Special Report) 

and the Report of the Secretary-General of 14 June 2017 on UNAMID,  

 Determining that the situation in Sudan constitutes a threat to international 

peace and security, 

 1. Decides to extend until 30 June 2018 the mandate of UNAMID;  

 2. Takes note of the recommendations of the Secretary-General and the 

Chairperson of the African Commission in the Special Report, supports the 

recommendation for a two-pronged approach, which focuses on military protection, 

explosive remnants of war clearance and emergency relief in the Jebel Marra area 

and, in other areas of Darfur where there has not been recent fighting, an approach 

that focuses on stabilising the situation, supporting the police and helping to build 

rule of law institutions whilst continuing to protect civilians, mediating 

intercommunal conflict and following up on security sector reform -related issues as 

provided in the DDPD and guided by the African Union Security Sector Reform 

Framework, and the implementation of the DDPD;  

 3. Underlines the need to keep the situation in all areas of Darfur under 

review, to conduct regular reviews of the geographic deployment of UNAMID’s 

force and to maintain the flexibility within UNAMID to respond to developments 

throughout Darfur as the situation requires;  

 4. Underlines that the reconfiguration of UNAMID has to be effectively 

mitigated by an improved ability to respond to threats quickly and adequately;  

 5. Decides that, in line with these recommendations, from the date of 

adoption of this resolution until six months thereafter (“phase one”), UNAMID’s 

authorised ceiling for troops and police shall be reduced to consist of up to 11,395

in the Special Report; 

 (ii) the impact of the phase one reductions on the areas that UNAMID has

 (iii) the Government of Sudan’s cooperation with UNAMID, including 

ensuring that UNAMID has unfettered freedom of movement and the ability to 

facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance throughout Darfur and the

units, unless the Security Council decides, taking into account the findings of the 

assessment requested in paragraph six of this Resolution, to adjust the scope and 

pace of the reduction; 

 8. Stresses that, in the context of the evolving security situation, any further 

refinement of the Mission should be based on progress against the benchmarks and 

the conditions on the ground, and implemented in a gradual, phased, flexible and 

reversible manner, and that a reduction in the uniformed component should preserve 

the hybrid nature of the Mission and should prioritise the retention o f the highest 

performing contingents; 

 9. Welcomes the intention to conduct a comprehensive Civilian Staffing 

Review of UNAMID to ensure that staffing levels are adjusted to implement the 

revised mandate and underlines the need for appropriate staffing levels in
