19 December 2007 on the oil slick on Lebanese shores,  

 Reaffirming the outcome of the United Nations Conference on the Human

States were requested to take all possible steps to prevent pollution of the seas,  

 Emphasizing the need to protect and preserve the marine environment in 
accordance with international law, 

 Taking into account the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and 
Development,2 especially principle 16, in which it was stipulated that the polluter 
should, in principle, bear the cost of pollution, and taking into account also chapter 
17 of Agenda 21,3  

 Noting again with great concern the environmental disaster caused by the 
destruction by the Israeli Air Force on 15 July 2006 of the oil storage tanks in the 
direct vicinity of El-Jiyeh electric power plant in Lebanon, resulting in an oil slick 
that covered the entirety of the Lebanese coastline and extended to the Syrian 
coastline,

 Noting again with appreciation the assistance offered by donor countries and 
international organizations for the early recovery and reconstruction of Lebanon 
through bilateral and multilateral channels, including the Athens Coordination 
Meeting on the response to the marine pollution incident in the Eastern 
Mediterranean, held on 17 August 2006, as well as the Stockholm Conference for 
Lebanon’s Early Recovery, held on 31 August 2006,  

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation 
of General Assembly resolution 62/188 of 19 December 2007 on the oil slick on 
Lebanese shores;4  

 2. Reiterates the expression of its deep concern about the adverse 
implications of the destruction by the Israeli Air Force of the oil storage tanks in the 
direct vicinity of the Lebanese El-Jiyeh electric power plant for the achievement of 
sustainable development in Lebanon;  

 3. Considers that the oil slick has heavily polluted the shores of Lebanon 
and partially polluted Syrian shores and consequently has had serious implications 
for livelihoods and the economy of Lebanon, owing to the adverse implications for 
natural resources, biodiversity, fisheries and tourism, and for human health, in the 
country;  

 4. Requests the Government of Israel to assume responsibility for prompt 
and adequate compensation to the Government of Lebanon and other countries 
directly affected by the oil slick, such as the Government of the Syrian Arab 
Republic, whose shores have been partially polluted, for the costs of repairing the 
environmental damage caused by the destruction, including the restoration of the 
marine environment; 

 5. Expresses its appreciation for the efforts of the Government of Lebanon 
and those of the Member States, regional and international organizations, regional 
and international financial institutions, non-governmental organizations and the 
private sector in the initiation of clean-up and rehabilitation operations on the 
polluted shores, and encourages the Member States and above-mentioned entities to 
continue their financial and technical support to the Government of Lebanon towards 
achieving the completion of clean-up and rehabilitation operations, with the aim of 
preserving the ecosystem of Lebanon and that of the Eastern Mediterranean Basin; 

 6. Decides to establish an Eastern Mediterranean oil spill restoration 
voluntary trust fund, based on voluntary contributions, in order to provide assistance 
and support to the States directly adversely affected in their integrated 
environmentally sound management, from clean-up to safe disposal of oily waste, of 
this environmental disaster resulting from the destruction of the oil storage tanks at 
El-Jiyeh electric power plant, and requests the Secretary-General to implement this 
decision before the end of the sixty-third session of the General Assembly; 

 7. Invites States, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental 
organizations and the private sector to make voluntary financial contributions to the 
trust fund, and, in this regard, requests the Secretary-General to mobilize 
international technical and financial assistance in order to ensure that the Eastern 
Mediterranean oil spill restoration voluntary trust fund has sufficient and adequate 
resources;
