 The General Assembly,  

 Recalling its resolutions 48/75 L of 16 December 1993, 53/77 I of 4 December 

1998, 55/33 Y of 20 November 2000, 56/24 J of 29 November 2001, 57/80 of 

22 November 2002, 58/57 of 8 December 2003, 59/81 of 3 December 2004, 64/29 of 

2 December 2009, 65/65 of 8 December 2010, 66/44 of 2 December 2011 and 67/53 

of 3 December 2012, its decisions 68/518 of 5 December 2013 and 69/516 of 

2 December 2014, its resolutions 70/39 of 7 December 2015 and 71/259 of 

23 December 2016, as well as its decision 72/513 of 4 December 2017 on the subject 

of a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other 

nuclear explosive devices,  

 Recalling also document CD/1299 of 24 March 1995, which indicated that all 

members of the Conference on Disarmament had agreed that the mandate to negotiate 

a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other 

nuclear explosive devices would not preclude any delegation from raising for 

consideration, in negotiations, any issue noted therein,  

 Reaffirming the importance of ensuring continued international commitment 

and high-level attention to making practical progress on achieving a world without 

nuclear weapons and on non-proliferation in all its aspects,  

 Mindful of the continuing importance and relevance of the Conference on 

Disarmament, and recalling the past achievements of that body in successfully 

negotiating non-proliferation and disarmament agreements,  

 Taking into account the adoption by consensus of the report of subsidiary body 2 

of the Conference on Disarmament on prevention of nuclear war, including all related

matters, with a general focus on a ban of the production of fissile materials for nuclear 

weapons and other explosive devices,1  

 Looking forward to the Conference again fulfilling its mandate as the world ’s 

single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum,  

 Convinced that a non-discriminatory, multilateral and effectively verifiable 

treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear 

explosive devices would represent a significant practical contribution to nuclear 

disarmament and non-proliferation efforts,  

 Recognizing the essential role of fissile material in the manufacture of nuclear 

weapons or other nuclear explosive devices and the long-standing efforts of the 

international community to negotiate a treaty that would ban its production for such 

purposes, 

 Recognizing also that a future treaty should not prohibit the production of fissile 

material for non-proscribed military purposes or civilian use, consistent with the 

obligations of States parties, or interfere in any other way with a State’s right to 

peaceful uses of nuclear energy, 

 Recalling action 15 of the conclusions and recommendations for follow-on 

actions agreed by consensus at the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the 

Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons2 that, inter alia, the Conference 

on Disarmament should, within the context of an agreed, comprehensive and balanced 

programme of work, immediately begin negotiation of a treaty banning the production 

of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices in 

accordance with the report of the Special Coordinator of 1995 (CD/1299) and the 

mandate contained therein, 

 Underlining that the consensus report of the Group of Governmental Experts, 

mandated in resolution 67/53, as contained in document A/70/81, and the 

deliberations which underpin it, serves as a valuable reference for States and should 

be a useful resource for negotiators of a treaty banning the production of  fissile 

material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices,  

 Noting with appreciation the work accomplished in 2017 and 2018 by the high-

level fissile material cut-off treaty expert preparatory group convened by the 

Secretary General following resolution 71/259, on the basis of equitable geographic 

distribution, to consider and make recommendations on substantial elements of a 

future non-discriminatory, multilateral and effectively verifiable treaty banning the 

production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, 

on the basis of document CD/1299 and the mandate contained therein,  

 Welcoming the participation of Member States in informal consultative 

meetings, organized by the Chair of the high-level fissile material cut-off treaty expert 

preparatory group, which were open-ended so that all Member States could engage in 

interactive discussions and share their views on a treaty banning the production of 

fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices,  

 Convinced that the report of the high-level fissile material cut-off treaty expert 

preparatory group, mandated in resolution 71/259, as contained in document 

A/73/159, read in conjunction with document A/70/81, should be taken into account 

by future negotiators in their deliberations,

 Recognizing the importance of concerted efforts to ensure that both women and 

men can participate equally, fully and effectively in the negotiation process of a future 

treaty,  

 1. Urges the Conference on Disarmament to agree on and implement at its 

earliest opportunity a programme of work that includes the immediate 

commencement of negotiations on a treaty banning the production of fissile material 

for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of document 

CD/1299 and the mandate contained therein;  

 2. Welcomes the adoption by consensus of the report of the high-level fissile 

material cut-off treaty expert preparatory group, mandated in resolution 71/259, as 

contained in document A/73/159;  

 3. Calls upon the Secretary-General to transmit the report of the high-level 

fissile material cut-off treaty expert preparatory group to the Conference on 

Disarmament prior to its 2019 session;  

 4. Urges Member States to give due consideration to the report of the high -

level fissile material cut-off treaty expert preparatory group, in conjunction with 

document A/70/81, including its call that further consideration be given to measures 

that might facilitate the commencement of treaty negotiations and enhance 

confidence, and calls upon the Conference on Disarmament to fully examine the 

report and consider further action as appropriate;  

 5. Urges the Conference on Disarmament to carry out further expert work to 

elaborate on all relevant aspects of a treaty banning the production of fissile material 

for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, including how the various 

approaches to verification of a treaty would work in practice and to assess the resource 

implications associated with the use in a treaty of the various potential elements;  

 6. Calls upon future negotiators of a treaty to take into account the work of 

the high-level fissile material cut-off treaty expert preparatory group, in conjunction 

with the work of the Group of Governmental Experts, as appropriate in their 

deliberations;  

 7. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-fourth session, 

under the item entitled “General and complete disarmament”, the sub-item entitled 

“Treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other 

nuclear explosive devices”.
