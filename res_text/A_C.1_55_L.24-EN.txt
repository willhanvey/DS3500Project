A/C.1/55/L.24

Recognizing that the changes that have taken place in the world have created
new opportunities as well as posed new challenges for the pursuit of disarmament
and, in this regard, bearing in mind that the regional centres for peace and
disarmament can contribute substantially to understanding and cooperation among
the States in each particular region in the areas of peace, disarmament and
development,

Noting  that in paragraph 146 of the Final Document of the Twelfth Conference
of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Durban, South
Africa, from 29 August to 3 September 1998, the heads of State or Government
welcomed the decision adopted by the General Assembly on maintaining and
revitalizing the three regional centres for peace and disarmament in Nepal, Peru and
Togo,5

level to increase the stability and security of its Member States, which could be
promoted in a substantive manner by the maintenance and revitalization of the three
regional centres for peace and disarmament;

2. Reaffirms that, in order to achieve positive results, it is useful for the
three regional centres to carry out dissemination and educational programmes that

principles and purposes of the United Nations;

3. Appeals to Member States in each region and those that are able to do so,

foundations, to make voluntary contributions to the regional centres in their

existing resources, to the regional centres in carrying out their programmes of
activities;
