of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and the 

comprehensive implementation of and follow-up to the Durban Declaration and 

Programme of Action”, 

 Acknowledging other important initiatives of the General Assembly aimed at 

raising awareness about the suffering of victims of racism, racial discrimination, 

xenophobia and related intolerance and forms of discrimination, including in the 

historical perspective, in particular regarding commemoration of the victims of 

slavery and the transatlantic slave trade,  

 Recalling the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal, and the Judgment of the 

Tribunal which recognized as criminal, inter alia, the SS organization and its integral 

parts, including the Waffen SS, through its officially accepted members implicated in 

or with knowledge of the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity 

connected with the Second World War, as well as other relevant provisions of the 

Charter and the Judgment, 

 Mindful of the horrors of the Second World War, and stressing in this regard that 

the victory over Nazism in the Second World War contributed to the establishment of 

the conditions for the creation of the United Nations, designed to prevent future wars 

and save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,  

 Recalling that, in 2020, the international community celebrates the seventy-fifth 

anniversary of victory over Nazism in the Second World War,  and looking forward in 

this regard to the holding of a special solemn meeting of the General Assembly,  

 Recalling also that the seventy-fifth session of the General Assembly coincides 

with the seventy-fifth anniversary of the establishment of the Nuremberg Tribunal 

and the adoption of its Charter,  

 Noting that neo-Nazism is more than just the glorification of a past movement, 

it is a contemporary phenomenon with strong vested interests in racial inequality and 

an investment in gaining broad support for its false claims of racial superiority,  

 Recalling the relevant provisions of the Durban Declaration and Programme of 

Action adopted by the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, 

Xenophobia and Related Intolerance on 8 September 2001, 9 in particular paragraph 2 

of the Declaration and paragraphs 84 to 86 of the Programme of Action, as well as 

the relevant provisions of the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference 

of 24 April 2009,10 in particular paragraphs 11, 13 and 54,  

 Alarmed at the spread in many parts of the world of various extremist political 

parties, movements, ideologies and groups of a racist or xenophobic character, 

including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and at the fact that this trend has resulted

3/11 20-14699 

 

in the implementation of discriminatory measures and policies at the local or national 

level, 

 Noting with concern that, even where neo-Nazis or extremists do not formally 

participate in government, the presence therein of extreme right-wing ideologues can 

have the effect of injecting into governance and political discourse the same 

ideologies that make neo-Nazism and extremism so dangerous,  

 Alarmed at music lyrics and video games that advocate racial hatred and incite 

discrimination, hostility or violence,  

 Concerned by the use of Internet platforms by groups that advocate hatred to 

plan, fundraise and circulate information about public events aimed at promoting 

racism, xenophobia and related intolerance, such as rallies, demonstrations and acts 

of violence, 

 Mindful of the role that the Internet can play in promoting equality, inclusion 

and non-discrimination, 

 Seriously concerned that neo-Nazi groups, as well as other groups and 

individuals espousing ideologies of hatred, have increasingly targeted susceptible 

individuals, mainly children and youth, by means of specifically tailored websites 

with the aim of their indoctrination and recruitment, 

 Deeply concerned by all recent manifestations of violence and terrorism incited 

by violent nationalism, racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia, Christianophobia, 

Afrophobia, xenophobia and related intolerance, including during sports events,  

 Recognizing with deep concern the continued alarming increase in instances of 

discrimination, intolerance and extremist violence motivated by antisemitism, 

Islamophobia and Christianophobia and prejudices against persons of other ethnic 

origins, religions and beliefs, 

 Underlining the existing lack of uniformity of norms regarding protected speech 

and expression and prohibited racial discrimination and advocacy of national, racial 

or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility o r violence, 

 Noting with concern, in this regard, that the variation in national standards 

prohibiting hate speech may provide safe havens for neo-Nazi, extremist, violent 

nationalist, xenophobic or racist speech owing to the fact that many neo -Nazi and 

relevant extremist groups of a racist or xenophobic character operate transnationally 

by relying on Internet service providers or social media platforms,  

 Stressing that the purpose of addressing hate speech is not to limit or prohibit 

freedom of speech, but to prevent incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, 

which shall be prohibited by law,  

 Expressing its concern about the use of digital technologies by neo-Nazis and 

other extremist and hate groups to disseminate their ideology, while recognizing that 

digital technologies are of great importance for the enjoyment of human rights and 

for combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related in tolerance, 

 1. Reaffirms the relevant provisions of the Durban Declaration and of the 

outcome document of the Durban Review Conference, in which States condemned 

the persistence and resurgence of neo-Nazism, neo-Fascism and violent nationalist 

ideologies based on racial and national prejudice and stated that those phenomena 

could never be justified in any instance or in any circumstances;  

 2. Recalls the provisions of the Durban Declaration and of the outcome 

document of the Durban Review Conference, in which States recognized the positive 

contribution that the exercise of the right to freedom of expression, in particular by 



A/C.3/75/L.49 
 

 

20-14699 4/11 

 

the media and new technologies, including the Internet, and full respect for the 

freedom to seek, receive and impart information can make to the fight against racism, 

racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance;  

 3. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Special Rapporteur of the 

Human Rights Council on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 

xenophobia and related intolerance, prepared in accordance with the request 

contained in its resolution 74/136;11 

 4. Expresses its appreciation to the United Nations High Commissioner for 

Human Rights and her Office for their efforts to fight racism, racial discrimination, 

xenophobia and related intolerance, including the maintenance by the Office of the 

United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights of the database on practical 

means to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance;  

 5. Expresses deep concern about the glorification, in any form, of the Nazi 

movement, neo-Nazism and former members of the Waffen SS organization, 

including by erecting monuments and memorials, holding public demonstrations in 

the name of the glorification of the Nazi past, the Nazi movement and neo -Nazism, 

declaring or attempting to declare such members and those who fought against the 

anti-Hitler coalition, collaborated with the Nazi movement and committed war crimes 

and crimes against humanity participants in national liberation movements, as well as 

by the renaming of streets glorifying them;  

 6. Calls for the universal ratification and effective implementation of the 

International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, 

and urges those States parties that have not yet done so to consider making the 

declaration under its article 14, thus providing the Committee on the Elimination of 

Racial Discrimination with the competence to receive and consider communications 

from individuals or groups of individuals within their jurisdiction claiming to be 

victims of a violation by a State party of any of the rights set forth in the Convention;  

 7. Urges States to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination by all 

appropriate means, including legislation as required by circumstances, while ensuring 

that the definition of racial discrimination set out therein complies with article 1 of 

the Convention; 

 8. Encourages those States that have made reservations to article 4 of the 

Convention to give serious consideration to withdrawing such reservations as a matter 

of priority, as stressed by the Special Rapporteur;  

 9. Acknowledges that discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity or religion 

in all its forms and manifestations, including neo-Nazism, Islamophobia, 

Christianophobia and antisemitism, is a threat to social cohesion, not just to those 

racial and ethnic groups that are their direct target;  

 10. Recalls that any legislative or constitutional measures adopted with a view 

to countering extremist political parties, movements, ideologies and groups of a racist 

or xenophobic character, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups and similar 

extremist ideological movements, should be in conformity with the relevant 

international human rights obligations, in particular articles 4 and 5 of the Convention 

and articles 19 to 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;  

 11. Encourages States parties to the Convention to take appropriate measures 

to ensure that their legislation is in accordance with their obligations under the 

Convention, including those under article 4;

5/11 20-14699 

 

 12. Stresses that the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and 

association are important in supporting the fight against racism, racial discrimination, 

xenophobia and related intolerance worldwide;  

 13. Emphasizes once more the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur that 

“any commemorative celebration of the Nazi regime, its allies and related 

organizations, whether official or unofficial, should be prohibited” by States, 12 also 

emphasizes that such manifestations do injustice to the memory of the countless 

victims of the Second World War and negatively influence children and young people, 

and stresses in this regard that it is important that States take measures, in accordance 

with international human rights law, to counteract any celebration of the Nazi SS 

organization and all its integral parts, including the Waffen SS, and that failure by 

States to effectively address such practices is incompatible with the obligations of 

States Members of the United Nations under its Charter;  

 14. Expresses deep concern about increased frequency of attempts and 

activities intended to desecrate or demolish monuments erected in remembrance of 

those who fought against Nazism during the Second World War, as well as to 

unlawfully exhume or remove the remains of such persons, and in this regard urges 

States to fully comply with their relevant obligations, inter alia, un der article 34 of 

Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1949; 13 

 15. Firmly condemns incidents that glorify and promote Nazism, such as acts 

involving pro-Nazi graffiti and paintings, including on monuments dedicated to 

victims of the Second World War; 

 16. Expresses alarm over the use by neo-Nazi groups, as well as other 

extremist groups and individuals espousing ideologies of hatred, of information 

technologies, the Internet and social media to recruit new members, especially 

targeting children and young people, and to disseminate and to amplify their hate-

filled messages, while recognizing that the Internet can also be used to counteract 

these groups and their activities; 

 17. Notes with concern the significant number of racist incidents worldwide, 

including the rise of skinhead groups, which have been responsible for many of these 

incidents, as well as the resurgence of racist and xenophobic violence targeting, inter 

alia, persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, or on 

any other grounds, including arson attacks on houses and vandalization of and 

violence in schools and places of worship and cemeteries;  

 18. Reaffirms that such acts may, in certain circumstances, be qualified as 

falling within the scope of the Convention, that they may not be justifiable as 

exercises of freedom of peaceful assembly, freedom of association and freedom of 

expression and that they will often fall within the scope of article 20 of the 

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and may be subject to certain 

restrictions, as set out in articles 19, 21 and 22 of the Covenant;  

 19. Encourages States to take appropriate concrete measures, including 

legislative and educational ones, in accordance with their international human  rights 

obligations, in order to prevent revisionism in respect of the Second World War and 

the denial of the crimes against humanity and war crimes committed during the 

Second World War;

 20. Calls upon States to take active measures to ensure that education systems 

develop the necessary content to provide accurate accounts of history, as well as 

promote tolerance and other international human rights principles;  

 21. Takes note of the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur that education 

that seeks to undercut the racist effects of nationalist populism should include 

accurate and representative accounts of national history that give voice to racial and 

ethnic diversity and that expose the untruths of those who attempt to write ethnic 

groups out of national histories and identities in order to sustain ethnonationalist 

myths of racially or ethnically “pure” nations;14 

 22. Condemns without reservation any denial of or attempt to deny the 

Holocaust, as well as any manifestation of religious intolerance, incit ement, 

harassment or violence against persons or communities, on the basis of ethnic origin 

or religious belief; 

 23. Affirms its deep commitment to the duty of remembrance, and welcomes 

the call of the Special Rapporteur for the active preservation of those Holocaust sites 

that served as Nazi death camps, concentration and forced labour camps and prisons, 

as well as his encouragement to States to take measures, including legislative, law 

enforcement and educational measures, to put an end to all forms of Holocaust 

denial;15 

 24. Takes note of the conclusions of the Special Rapporteur that revisionism 

and attempts to falsify history may, in certain circumstances, fall under the prohibition 

of hate speech under article 4 (a) of the Convention, which States are required to 

declare as offences punishable by law,16 and that neo-Nazi recruitment attempting to 

mainstream extreme ideologies or racial, ethnic or religious hatred and intolerance 

may fall under article 4 (b) of the Convention;  

 25. Calls upon States to continue to take all appropriate measures aimed at 

preventing and countering hate speech, including on the Internet, and incitement to 

violence against persons in vulnerable situations, including the organization of 

meetings and violent protests, fundraising and engagement in other activi ties; 

 26. Expresses serious concern regarding attempts to prohibit, at the legislative 

level, symbols associated in States with the victory over Nazism; 

 27. Expresses deep concern about attempts at commercial advertising aimed 

at exploiting the sufferings of the victims of war crimes and crimes against humanity 

committed during the Second World War by the Nazi regime;  

 28. Stresses the need to respect the memory and that the practices described 

above do injustice to the memory of the countless victims of crimes against humanity 

committed in the Second World War, in particular those committed by the SS 

organization and by those who fought against the anti-Hitler coalition and 

collaborated with the Nazi movement, and may negatively influence children and 

young people, and that failure by States to effectively address such practices is 

incompatible with the obligations of States Members of the United Nations under its 

Charter, including those related to the purposes and principles of the Organization;  

 29. Also stresses that all such practices may fuel contemporary forms of 

racism, racial discrimination, antisemitism, Islamophobia, Christianophobia, 

xenophobia and related intolerance and contribute to the spread and multiplication of 

various extremist political parties, movements and groups of a racist or xenophobic

character, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and in this regard calls for 

increased vigilance; 

 30. Expresses concern that the human rights and democratic challenges posed 

by extremist political parties, movements and groups are universal and no country is 

immune to them; 

 31. Emphasizes the need to take appropriate measures necessary to counter the 

practices described above, and calls upon States and all other stakeholders to take 

more effective measures in accordance with international human rights law to 

prevent, counter and combat those phenomena and extremist movements of a racist 

or xenophobic character, which pose a real threat to democratic values, and to increase 

their vigilance and be proactive in strengthening their efforts to recognize and 

effectively address those challenges;  

 32. Underlines the importance of data and statistics on racist and xenophobic 

crimes for identifying the types of offences committed, the profiles of victims and of 

perpetrators and whether the latter are affiliated with extremist movements or groups, 

thus enhancing better understanding of the phenomenon and identifying effective 

measures to address such racist and xenophobic crimes, and recalls in this regard the 

commitments made in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 17 on data, 

monitoring and accountability, including collecting data disaggregated by 

characteristics relevant in national contexts;  

 33. Encourages States to adopt further measures to support training for the 

police and other law enforcement bodies on the ideologies of extremist political 

parties, movements and groups whose advocacy constitutes incitement to racist and 

xenophobic violence, to strengthen their capacity to address racist and xenophobic 

crimes, to fulfil their responsibility for bringing to justice the perpetrators of such 

crimes and to combat impunity; 

 34. Expresses deep concern about the increased number of seats occupied by 

representatives of extremist parties of a racist or xenophobic character in a number of 

national and local parliaments, and emphasizes in this regard the need for all 

democratic political parties to base their programmes and activities on respect for 

human rights and freedoms, democracy, the rule of law and good governance and to 

condemn all messages disseminating ideas that are based on racial superiority or 

hatred and that have the objective of fuelling contemporary forms of racism, racial 

discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance;  

 35. Takes note of the concern of the Special Rapporteur regarding the 

resurgence of neo-Nazism in contemporary times and growing support for and 

acceptance of neo-Nazism and related ideology in an increasing number of 

countries;18

forming coalitions with extremist parties of a racist or xenophobic character;19 

 37. Welcomes the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur to continue to 

take steps through national legislation, in accordance with international human rights

organizations where such hate speech aims, or can reasonably be expected, to  incite 

violence;20 

 38. Encourages States to improve diversity within law enforcement agencies, 

and urges them to take all appropriate measures to facilitate the filing of complaints 

about and to impose appropriate sanctions against those within the publi c service 

found to have committed racially motivated violence or to have used hate speech;  

 39. Expresses deep concern about the increase in reported cases of racist, 

antisemitic, Islamophobic, Arabophobic, Afrophobic and xenophobic manifestations 

during sports events, including those committed by extremist groups of a racist or 

xenophobic character, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and calls upon 

States, international organizations, sports federations and other relevant stakeholders 

to strengthen measures to address such incidents, while also welcoming the steps that 

many States, sports federations and clubs have taken to eliminate racism at sporting 

events, including through sport practised without discrimination of any kind and in 

the Olympic spirit, which require human understanding, tolerance, inclusion, fair play 

and solidarity; 

 40. Recalls the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur to introduce into 

national criminal law a provision according to which committing an offence with 

racist or xenophobic motivations or aims constitutes an aggravating circumstance, 

allowing for enhanced penalties,21 and encourages those States whose legislation does 

not contain such provisions to consider that recommendation;  

 41. Notes measures taken by States to prevent discrimination against, in 

particular but not limited to, persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and 

linguistic minorities, people of African descent, Roma, migrants, refugees and asylum 

seekers, and to ensure their integration into society, urges States to ensure the full and 

effective implementation of legal, policy and institutional measures protecting these 

individuals and groups, including women and girls, and recommends that States 

effectively guarantee to everyone, without discrimination of any kind, their human 

rights, including those related to safety and security, access to justice, adequate 

reparation and appropriate information about their rights, and pursue prosecution and 

adequate punishment, as appropriate, of those responsible for racist and xenophobic 

crimes against them, including the possibility of seeking reparation or satisfaction for 

damages suffered as a result of such crimes;  

 42. Underlines that the roots of extremism are multifaceted and must be 

addressed through adequate measures such as education, awareness-raising and the 

promotion of dialogue, and in this regard recommends the increase of measures to 

raise awareness among young people of the dangers of the ideologies and activities 

of extremist political parties, movements and groups; 

 43. Reaffirms, in this regard, the particular importance of all forms of 

education, including human rights education, as a complement to legislative 

measures, and calls upon States to continue to invest in education, in both 

conventional and non-conventional curricula, inter alia, in order to transform attitudes 

and counteract ideas of racial hierarchies and superiority, and counter their negative 

influence, and to promote the values of non-discrimination, equality and respect for 

all, as outlined by the Special Rapporteur;  

 44. Recognizes the paramount role of education in promoting human rights 

and fundamental freedoms and combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 

and related intolerance, especially in promoting the principles of tolerance,

on the basis of ethnic origin, nationality, religion or belief;

the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly, in which he emphasized the 

importance of history classes in teaching the dramatic events and human suffering

 47. Stresses the importance of other positive measures and initiatives aimed at 

bringing communities together and providing them with space for genuine dialogue, 

such as round tables, working groups and seminars, including training seminars for 

State agents and media professionals, as well as awareness-raising activities, 

especially those initiated by civil society representatives, which require continued 

State support; 

 48. Underlines the positive role that relevant United Nations entities and 

programmes, in particular the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 

Organization, can play in the aforementioned areas; 

 49. Reaffirms article 4 of the Convention, according to which States parties 

condemn all propaganda and all organizations which are based on ideas or theories of 

superiority of one race or group of persons of one colour or ethnic origin, or which 

attempt to justify or promote racial hatred and discrimination in any form, and 

undertake to adopt immediate and positive measures designed to eradicate all 

incitement to, or acts of, such discrimination and, to this end, with due regard to the 

principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights 

expressly set forth in article 5 of the Convention, inter alia:  

 (a) Shall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based

activities, including the financing thereof;

other propaganda activities, which promote and incite racial discrimination, and shall 

recognize participation in such organizations or activities as an offence punishable by

to promote or incite racial discrimination;  

 50. Also reaffirms that, as underlined in paragraph 13 of the outcome 

document of the Durban Review Conference, any advocacy of national, racial or 

religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence 

should be prohibited by law, that all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority 

or hatred, or incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts of violence or 

incitement to such acts, shall be declared offences punishable by law, in accordance 

with the international obligations of States, and that these prohibitions are consistent 

with freedom of opinion and expression; 

 51. Notes the launch by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Strategy 

and Plan of Action on Hate Speech, which can play its part in addressing hate speech
