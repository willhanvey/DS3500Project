 Noting that, as a small island Territory, Tokelau exemplifies the situation of

2006 and the October 2007 referendums, monitored by the United Nations;

future act of self-determination by Tokelau will be deferred and that New Zealand 
and Tokelau will devote renewed effort and attention to ensuring that essential 
services and infrastructure on the atolls of Tokelau are enhanced and strengthened, 
thereby ensuring an enhanced quality of life for the people of Tokelau; 

 9. Also acknowledges Tokelau’s initiative in devising a strategic economic

Territories affecting the internal structure of governance about which the Special 
Committee has received information,

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 
important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people, 

 Convinced also that any negotiations to determine the status of a Territory 
must take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of that 
Territory, under the aegis of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that 
the views of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories in respect of their 
right to self-determination should be ascertained, 

 Noting that a number of Non-Self-Governing Territories have expressed 
concern at the procedure followed by some administering Powers, contrary to the

sending further visiting missions to the Territories at an appropriate time, in 
consultation with the relevant administering Powers and in accordance with the 
relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations on decolonization, 

 Mindful also that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its 
understanding of the political status of the peoples of the Territories and to fulfil its

administering Powers and to receive information from other appropriate sources, 
including the representatives of the Territories, concerning the wishes and 
aspirations of the peoples of the Territories, 

 Acknowledging the regular transmission by the administering Powers to the

bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at 
assisting the peoples of the Territories in gaining a better understanding of the 
options for self-determination, 

 Mindful, in this connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the 
Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 
representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 
the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate, and that the regional nature of the 
seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial 
element in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political 
status of the Territories,

Territories before the Special Committee and at its regional seminars, 

 Mindful that the 2009 Caribbean regional seminar was held in Frigate Bay,

and environmental degradation, and, in this connection, bearing in mind the 
applicability to the Territories of the programmes of action or outcome documents 
of all United Nations world conferences and special sessions of the General 
Assembly in the economic and social spheres, 

 Noting with appreciation the contribution to the development of some 
Territories by the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations 
system, in particular the United Nations Development Programme, the Economic 
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and the Economic and Social 
Commission for Asia and the Pacific, as well as regional institutions such as the 
Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean Community, the Organization of 
Eastern Caribbean States, the Pacific Islands Forum and the agencies of the Council 
of Regional Organizations in the Pacific, 

 Aware that the Human Rights Committee, as part of its mandate under the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,4 reviews the status of the self-
determination process, including in small island Territories under examination by 
the Special Committee, 

 Recalling the ongoing efforts of the Special Committee in carrying out a 
critical review of its work with the aim of making appropriate and constructive 
recommendations and decisions to attain its objectives in accordance with its 
mandate, 

 Recognizing that the annual working papers prepared by the Secretariat on
