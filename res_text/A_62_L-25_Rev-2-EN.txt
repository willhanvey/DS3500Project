  Global Forum on Migration and Development 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling that the 2005 World Summit Outcome acknowledged the important 
nexus between international migration and development and the need to deal with 
the challenges and opportunities that migration presents and reaffirmed the resolve 
to take measures to ensure the respect for and protection of the human rights of 
migrants, migrant workers and members of their families,1 

 Considering that the summary of the High-level Dialogue on International 
Migration and Development held in New York on 14 and 15 September 2006, as 
contained in a note by the President of the General Assembly,2 underlined the close 
link among migration, development and human rights, as well as that respect for the 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of all migrants was essential for taking 
advantage of the positive aspects of international migration, 

 Recalling its resolutions 61/208 of 20 December 2006 on international 
migration and development and 62/156 of 18 December 2007 on the protection of 
migrant workers, 

 Stressing the need to promote a comprehensive and coherent discussion on all 
aspects of the phenomenon of migration, taking into account its importance on the 
global agenda,  

 Recognizing the need for Member States to consider the multidimensional 
aspects of international migration and development, in order to identify appropriate 
ways and means of dealing with the challenges and opportunities that international 
migration presents,

 Recalling the important contribution provided by migrants and migration to 
development, as well as the interrelationship between migration and development, 
and the importance of including the perspective of the human rights of migrants as a 
priority matter in relevant debates and discussions that are held in the United 
Nations system, 

 Considering that the report of the Secretary-General of 18 May 2006 on 
international migration and development,3 prepared pursuant to General Assembly 
resolutions 59/241 of 22 December 2004 and 60/227 of 23 December 2005, 
highlighted the fact that, within the United Nations system, there is no entity 
mandated to systematically address all matters related to international migration, 

 Recalling that Member States participating in the High-level Dialogue on 
International Migration and Development expressed interest in continuing the 
dialogue on migration and development, and that there was widespread support for 
the proposal of the Secretary-General to create a global forum to address, in depth 
and in a systematic manner, all topics related to international migration and 
development, 

 Taking note of the summary report of the first meeting of the Global Forum on 
Migration and Development,4 held in Brussels in July 2007 under the auspices of 
the Government of Belgium, and the generous offer of the Government of the 
Philippines to host the second meeting in Manila in October 2008,  

 Noting with appreciation that the convening of the first meeting of the Global 
Forum on Migration and Development has already resulted in the establishment of 
an official focal point on migration and development at the national level,  

 Recognizing that the Global Forum on Migration and Development currently 
functions under the Guiding Principles of the Global Forum on Migration and 
Development of 2007 and as a State-led initiative, and that it should be strengthened 
with the aim of addressing the multidimensional aspects of international migration 
and development with a comprehensive approach,  

 1. Recognizes that exchanges of information and expertise, consultation and 
closer cooperation between the Global Forum on Migration and Development and 
the United Nations could have a positive impact, and in this regard: 

 (a) Welcomes the transmission by the Government of Belgium of the 
Summary report of the first meeting of the Global Forum on Migration and 
Development to the Secretary-General, circulated as a document of the General 
Assembly,4 and invites organizers of subsequent meetings of the Forum to continue 
this practice; 

 (b) Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report called for in its 
resolution 61/208 of 20 December 2006 an evaluation of the existing cooperation 
mechanisms on migration and development and to make it available to the second 
meeting of the Global Forum on Migration and Development, in 2008; 

 (c) Encourages Member States to participate actively in, and the 
organizations that are members of the Global Migration Group, within their

respective areas of expertise, to contribute and to provide technical support to the 
Global Forum on Migration and Development;  

 (d) Notes that the Forum, through its Steering Group, maintains links with 
the Secretary-General, notably through his Special Representative on International 
Migration and Development; 

 2. Takes note with interest of the agenda prepared for the discussions of the 
Global Forum on Migration and Development, and the title of the second meeting of 
the Global Forum, “Protecting and empowering migrants for development”, and 
particularly welcomes the inclusion of the topic of the human rights of migrants; 

 3. Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report on the implementation 
of the present resolution to the General Assembly at its sixty-third session.
