agreements reached between the parties,

Taking into consideration the detrimental impact of Israeli settlement policies,
decisions and activities on the Middle East peace process,

Gravely concerned in particular about the dangerous situation resulting from

Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General,3

1. Reaffirms that Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territory, including
Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan are illegal and an obstacle to peace and
economic and social development;

Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12
August 1949,1 to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including Jerusalem, and to the
occupied Syrian Golan and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the
Convention, in particular article 49;

3. Demands complete cessation of the construction of the settlement in

Territory, including Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan;

4. Stresses the need for full implementation of Security Council resolution
904 (1994) of 18 March 1994, in which, among other things, the Council called
upon Israel, the occupying Power, to continue to take and implement measures,
including confiscation of arms, with the aim of preventing illegal acts of violence by
Israeli settlers, and called for measures to be taken to guarantee the safety and
protection of the Palestinian civilians in the occupied territory;

5. Reiterates its call for the prevention of illegal acts of violence by Israeli
settlers, particularly in the light of recent developments;

6. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its
fifty-seventh session on the implementation of the present resolution.
