 in achieving nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation,

Treaty, agreed to at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the 

Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and reaffirmed by the 2010 Review 

Conference, 

 Bearing in mind the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on 

the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons, issued on 8 July 1996,

zones and Mongolia to reject nuclear weapons,

at all times to comply with applicable international law, including international 

humanitarian law. 

 7. We reiterate our concern at the human and economic resources that 

continue to be dedicated to the development, maintenance and modernization of 

nuclear weapons, and stress the need to invest those resources in strengthening 

peace and security and sustainable development and lifting the lives of millions of 

people out of poverty. 

 8. We reaffirm the central role of the United Nations in the field of 

disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control processes.  

 9. We reaffirm multilateralism as the core principle in negotiations in the 

area of disarmament and non-proliferation and recognize the urgent need to achieve 

progress towards multilateral negotiations on nuclear disarmament, in particular to 

enable the Conference on Disarmament to perform its mandate as set out in the Final 

Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly of 30 June 1978.
5
 

 10. We reaffirm that nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are 

mutually reinforcing processes.  

 11. We stress the need for effective measures of nuclear disarmament, which 

have the highest priority, and call upon all nuclear -weapon-possessing States to 

eliminate all types of their nuclear weapons and in the meantime diminish the role 

of nuclear weapons in security policies and avoid activities that hamper the 

achievement of a world free of nuclear weapons.  

 12. We reiterate that each article of the Treaty on the Non -Proliferation of 

Nuclear Weapons is binding on its States parties at all times and in all circumstances 

and call upon the nuclear-weapon States to implement their obligations under the 

Treaty and commitments made at the 1995, 2000 and 2010 Review Conferences.  

 13. We reaffirm our determination to implement nuclear disarmament 

commitments and obligations and to advance additional measures to strengthen the 

rule of law in disarmament, including the negotiation and adoption of a global,  

non-discriminatory, multilateral, legally binding instrument for the total elimination 

of nuclear weapons.  

 14. We recognize that achieving a nuclear-weapon-free world will be 

realized through a phased process that should have an agreed timeline. 

 15. We call upon all States to take further practical  steps leading to nuclear 

disarmament in accordance with the principles contained in the Final Document of 

the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly of 30 June 1978.  

 16. We reaffirm that disarmament measures concerning nuclear weapons 

should satisfy multilaterally agreed criteria of strict verification, irreversibility, 

transparency and be undertaken through legally binding commitments to achieve the 

total elimination of all nuclear weapons.  

 17. We encourage all States concerned to establish further nuclear-weapon-

free zones in accordance with Disarmament Commission guidelines of 1999,
