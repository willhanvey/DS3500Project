ELIMINATION OF COERCIVE ECONOMIC MEASURES AS
A MEANS OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC COMPULSION

Libyan Arab Jamahiriya: draft resolution

The General Assembly,

Guided by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, particularly
those which call for the development of friendly relations among nations, and
the achievement of cooperation in solving problems of an economic and social
character,

Recalling its numerous resolutions in which it called upon the
international community to take urgent and effective steps to end coercive
economic measures,

Gravely concerned over the recent enactment of extraterritorial coercive
economic laws in contravention of the norms of international law and the aims
and purposes of the United Nations,

Believing that the prompt elimination of such measures is consistent with
the aims and purposes of the United Nations and the relevant provisions of the
World Trade Organization,

1. Reaffirms the inalienable right of every State to economic and social
development and to choose the political, economic and social system which it
deems most appropriate for the welfare of its people, in accordance with its
national plans and policies;

2. Calls for the immediate repeal of unilateral extraterritorial laws
that impose sanctions on companies and nationals of other States;

3. Calls upon all States not to recognize unilateral extraterritorial
coercive economic measures or legislative acts imposed by any State;

its fifty-second session a report on the implementation of this resolution;

5. Decides to include in the agenda of its fifty-second session an item
entitled "Elimination of coercive economic measures as a means of political and
economic compulsion".
