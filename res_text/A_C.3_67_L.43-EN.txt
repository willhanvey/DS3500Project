 Reaffirming that everyone is entitled to a social and international order in 
which the rights and freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights2 can be fully realized,  

 Reaffirming also the determination expressed in the Preamble to the Charter to 
save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, to establish conditions under 
which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources 
of international law can be maintained, to promote social progress and better 
standards of life in larger freedom, to practise tolerance and good-neighbourliness, 
and to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social 
advancement of all peoples,  

 Stressing that the responsibility for managing worldwide economic and social 
issues, as well as threats to international peace and security, must be shared among 
the nations of the world and should be exercised multilaterally, and that in this 
regard the central role must be played by the United Nations, as the most universal 
and representative organization in the world,  

 Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the 
aspirations of all peoples for an international order based on the principles enshrined 
in the Charter, including promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all and respect for the principle of equal rights and self-
determination of peoples, peace, democracy, justice, equality, the rule of law, 
pluralism, development, better standards of living and solidarity,  

 Recognizing that the enhancement of international cooperation in the field of 
human rights is essential for the full achievement of the purposes of the United 
Nations, including the effective promotion and protection of all human rights,  

 Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that all 
human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is 
entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein, without distinction of any 
kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
national or social origin, property, birth or other status,  

 Reaffirming that democracy, development and respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing, and that 
democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their 
own political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in 
all aspects of their lives,  

 Recognizing that the promotion and protection of human rights should be 
based on the principle of cooperation and genuine dialogue and aimed at 
strengthening the capacity of Member States to comply with their human rights 
obligations for the benefit of all human beings,  

 Emphasizing that democracy is not only a political concept, but that it also has 
economic and social dimensions,  

 Recognizing that democracy, respect for all human rights, including the right 
to development, transparent and accountable governance and administration in all 
sectors of society, and effective participation by civil society are an essential part of

the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred 
sustainable development,  

 Noting with concern that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance may be aggravated by, inter alia, inequitable distribution of wealth, 
marginalization and social exclusion,  

 Reaffirming that dialogue among religions, cultures and civilizations could 
contribute greatly to the enhancement of international cooperation at all levels,  

 Underlining the fact that it is imperative for the international community to 
ensure that globalization becomes a positive force for all the world’s people, and 
that only through broad and sustained efforts, based on our common humanity in all 
its diversity, can globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable,  

 Deeply concerned that the current global economic, financial, energy and food 
crises, resulting from a combination of several major factors, including 
macroeconomic and other factors, such as environmental degradation, 
desertification and global climate change, natural disasters and the lack of financial 
resources and the technology necessary to confront their negative impact in 
developing countries, particularly in the least developed countries and small island 
developing States, represent a global scenario that is threatening the adequate 
enjoyment of all human rights and widening the gap between developed and 
developing countries,  

 Stressing that efforts to make globalization fully inclusive and equitable must 
include policies and measures, at the global level, that correspond to the needs of 
developing countries and countries with economies in transition and are formulated 
and implemented with their effective participation,  

 Stressing also the need for adequate financing of and technology transfer to 
developing countries, in particular the landlocked developing countries and small 
island developing States, including to support their efforts to adapt to climate 
change,  

 Having listened to the peoples of the world, and recognizing their aspirations 
to justice, to equality of opportunity for all, to the enjoyment of their human rights, 
including the right to development, to live in peace and freedom and to equal 
participation without discrimination in economic, social, cultural, civil and political 
life,  

 Recalling Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the 
Council and 5/2 on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate Holders of 
the Council, both of 18 June 2007,3 and stressing that all mandate holders shall
