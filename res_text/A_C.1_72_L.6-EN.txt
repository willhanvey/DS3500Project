17-17642 2/4 

 

 Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration,
3
 in which it is stated, 

inter alia, that responsibility for managing worldwide economic and social 

development, as well as threats to international peace and security, must be shared 

among the nations of the world and should be exercised multilaterally and that, as 

the most universal and most representative organization in the world, the United 

Nations must play the central role,  

 Welcoming the efforts by Member States to secure progress in multilateral 

disarmament and the support of the Secretary-General for such efforts, and recalling 

in this regard the Secretary-General’s five-point proposal on nuclear disarmament,  

 Recalling that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,
4
 which 

serves as the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime, 

was negotiated considering the devastation that would be visited upon all mankind 

by a nuclear war and the consequent need to make every effort to avert the danger 

of such a war and to take measures to safeguard the security of peoples,  

 Stressing that the only way to guarantee that nuclear weapons are never used 

again is through their complete elimination and that a legally binding  prohibition of 

nuclear weapons constitutes an essential contribution towards that end, as well as 

towards the implementation of article VI of the Treaty on the Non -Proliferation of 

Nuclear Weapons, 

 Recalling the obligations of States parties to the Treaty on the 

Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and their commitments as reflected in the 

outcome documents of the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to 

the Treaty,
5
 and of the 2000

6
 and the 2010

7
 Review Conferences of the Parties to the 

Treaty, 

 Stressing the importance of the full and effective implementation by the States 

parties to the Treaty of the various commitments made at the review conferences,  

 Reaffirming the absolute validity of multilateral diplomacy in the field of 

disarmament and non-proliferation, and determined to promote multilateralism as an 

essential way to develop arms regulation and disarmament negotiations,  

 Mindful of the obligation of States to engage in negotiations in good faith on 

effective measures towards nuclear disarmament,  

 Recognizing that the current international climate makes increased political 

attention to disarmament and non-proliferation issues, the promotion of multilateral 

disarmament and the achievement of a world without nuclear weapons all the more 

urgent, 

 Welcoming the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on nuclear 

disarmament, held on 26 September 2013 pursuant to its resolution 67/39 of 

3 December 2012, which highlighted the wish of the international community for 

progress in this field, and noting its resolution 68/32 of 5 December 2013 as a 

follow-up to this meeting, 

 Welcoming also the report on the work of the Open-ended Working Group to 

develop proposals to take forward multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations for

 Stressing the importance of inclusiveness, and encouraging the participation of
