The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolution 54/151 of 17 December 1999, and taking note of
Commission on Human Rights resolution 2000/3 of 7 April 2000,1

Recalling also all of its relevant resolutions, in which, inter alia, it condemned

interference, their political status and to pursue their economic, social and cultural
development and every State has the duty to respect this right in accordance with the
provisions of the Charter,

Recognizing that mercenary activities continue to increase in many parts of the
world and take on new forms, permitting mercenaries to operate in a better
organized way, with increased pay, and that their numbers have grown and more
persons are prepared to become mercenaries,

Alarmed and concerned about the danger that the activities of mercenaries
constitute to peace and security in developing countries, in particular in Africa and
in small States, and also elsewhere,

Deeply concerned about the loss of life, the substantial damage to property and
the negative effects on the policy and economies of affected countries resulting from
mercenary aggression and criminal activities,

Convinced that it is necessary for Member States to ratify the International
Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries,
adopted by the General Assembly on 4 December 1989,3 and to develop and
maintain international cooperation among States for the prevention, prosecution and
punishment of mercenary activities,

Convinced also that, notwithstanding the way in which mercenaries or
mercenary-related activities are used or the form they take to acquire some
semblance of legitimacy, they are a threat to peace, security and the self-
determination of peoples and an obstacle to the enjoyment of human rights by
peoples,

1. Welcomes the report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on
Human Rights on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and
impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination;4

2. Reaffirms that the recruitment, use, financing and training of mercenaries
are causes for grave concern to all States and violate the purposes and principles
enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations;

3. Recognizes that armed conflict, terrorism, arms trafficking and covert
operations by third Powers, inter alia, encourage the demand for mercenaries on the
global market;

4. Urges all States to take the necessary steps and to exercise the utmost
vigilance against the menace posed by the activities of mercenaries and to take the
necessary legislative measures to ensure that their territories and other territories
under their control, as well as their nationals, are not used for the recruitment,
assembly, financing, training and transit of mercenaries for the planning of activities
designed to destabilize or overthrow the Government of any State or threaten the
territorial integrity and political unity of sovereign States, or to promote secession or
to fight the national liberation movements struggling against colonial or other forms
of alien domination or occupation;

visits from the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the use
of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of
the right of peoples to self-determination;

7. Also welcomes the adoption by some States of national legislation that
restricts the recruitment, assembly, financing, training and transit of mercenaries;

8. Invites States to investigate the possibility of mercenary involvement
whenever criminal acts of a terrorist nature occur;

9. Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with
all the necessary assistance, both professional and financial;

10. Recommends that the Commission on Human Rights renew the mandate
of the Special Rapporteur for a period of three years;

11. Urges all States to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur in the
fulfilment of his mandate;

12. Requests the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights, as a matter of priority, to be programmed in its immediate activities,
to publicize the adverse effects of mercenary activities on the right to self-
determination and, when requested and where necessary, to render advisory services
to States that are affected by the activities of mercenaries;

13. Requests the Secretary-General to invite Governments to make proposals
towards a clearer legal definition of mercenaries, and, in this regard, strongly urges
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to convene a workshop
on the traditional and new forms of mercenary activities as a means of violating
human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination
before the fifty-seventh session of the Commission on Human Rights, so that a
report on the outcome of the workshop may be presented to the Commission at its
fifty-seventh session;

14. Requests the Special Rapporteur to report his findings on the use of
mercenaries to undermine the right of peoples to self-determination, with specific
recommendations, to the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session;

15. Decides to consider at its fifty-sixth session the question of the use of
mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the
right of peoples to self-determination under the item entitled “Right of peoples to
self-determination”.
