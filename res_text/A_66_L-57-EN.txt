 Expressing grave concern at the escalation of violence in the Syrian Arab

against the Syrian population, and the failure of the Government of the Syrian Arab 
Republic to protect its population,

 Taking note of the report of the independent international commission of 
inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic,1 which notes that the human rights situation in 
the Syrian Arab Republic has deteriorated significantly since November 2011, 
causing more suffering to the Syrian people, and that widespread violence and 
increasingly precarious socioeconomic conditions have left many communities in a 
perilous situation, 

 Recalling that the High Commissioner for Human Rights, in her statement on 
27 May 2012, stated that acts of violence in the Syrian Arab Republic may amount 
to crimes against humanity or other forms of international crime and may be 
indicative of a pattern of widespread or systematic attacks against civilian 
populations that have been perpetrated with impunity, 

 Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on children and armed 
conflict,2 which indicates the occurrence of grave violations against children in the 
Syrian Arab Republic, that children were among the victims of military operations 
carried out by Government forces, including the armed forces, Syrian intelligence 
forces and “Shabbiha” militias, and that children as young as 9 years of age were 
victims of killing and maiming, arbitrary arrest, detention, torture and ill-treatment, 
including sexual violence, and used as human shields, 

 Expressing concern at the vulnerable situation of women in this context, 
including being subjected to discrimination, sexual and physical abuse, violation of 
their privacy, arbitrary arrest and detention in raids, including to force their male 
relatives to surrender, and underlining the importance of preventing all sexual 
violence and violence based on gender, 

 Concerned about the humanitarian impact of violence, including as a result of 
oppression and violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular 
the use by the Syrian authorities of excessive force, heavy weapons, armour and the 
air force against populated areas, 

 Concerned also that the escalating violence caused an influx of Syrian 
refugees into neighbouring countries, and condemning the attacks by the Syrian 
authorities on people trying to exit Syrian territory to escape the violence, 

 Echoing the extreme concern expressed by the Under-Secretary-General for 
Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator on 29 July 2012 at the 
impact of shelling and the use of tanks and other heavy weapons on people in 
Aleppo, as well as in the capital Damascus and surrounding towns, 

 Expressing its profound regret at the death of many thousands of people in 
Syria and extending condolences to their families, 

 Expressing its determination to seek ways and means to provide protection to 
the Syrian civil population, 

 Reaffirming its support for the Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and 
the League of Arab States and his work, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 
66/253 and relevant resolutions of the League of Arab States, aimed at promoting a 
peaceful solution to the Syrian crisis, including by securing full implementation of 
the six-point plan annexed to Security Council resolution 2042 (2012),

 Expressing its deep concern at the lack of progress towards implementation of 
the six-point plan, and deploring the failure of the Security Council to agree on 
measures to ensure the compliance of Syrian authorities with its decisions, 

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 
territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic and to the principles of the Charter, 

 Recalling that all Members of the United Nations shall refrain in their 
international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity 
or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the 
purposes of the United Nations, 

 Reaffirming the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and relevant international human rights 
treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and 
recalling the obligation of the Syrian Arab Republic to promote and protect human 
rights and fundamental freedoms, 

 Stressing that rapid progress on a political transition represents the best 
opportunity to resolve the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic peacefully, 
welcoming, in this regard, the final communiqué issued by the Action Group on 
30 June 2012, and noting that progress towards an atmosphere free from violence, 
fear and intimidation is key to enabling a credible transition that meets the 
aspirations of the Syrian people, 

 Reaffirming its support for the engagement of the Secretary-General and all 
diplomatic efforts aimed at reaching a political solution to the crisis, reaffirming 
also the role of regional and subregional organizations in the maintenance of 
international peace and security as set out in Chapter VIII of the Charter of the 
United Nations, and welcoming the relevant decisions of the League of Arab States, 
including its resolution of 22 July 2012, 

 1. Condemns the increasing use by the Syrian authorities of heavy weapons, 
including indiscriminate shelling from tanks and helicopters, in population centres 
and the failure to withdraw its troops and the heavy weapons to their barracks, 
contrary to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 2042 (2012) and paragraph 2 
of Council resolution 2043 (2012); 

 2. Strongly condemns the continued widespread and systematic gross 
violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by the Syrian authorities and 
pro-government militias, such as the use of force against civilians, massacres, 
arbitrary executions, the killing and persecution of protestors, human rights 
defenders and journalists, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, interference 
with access to medical treatment, torture, sexual violence, and ill-treatment, 
including against children, as well as any human rights abuses by armed opposition 
groups; 

 3. Condemns all violence, irrespective of where it comes from, including 
terrorist acts; 

 4. Demands that all parties immediately and visibly implement Security 
Council resolutions 2042 (2012) and 2043 (2012) in order to achieve a cessation of 
armed violence in all its forms by all parties, thereby creating an atmosphere 
conducive to a sustained cessation of violence and a Syrian-led political transition 
that meets the aspirations of the Syrian people;  



A/66/L.57  
 

12-44737 4 
 

 5. Fully supports the demand of the Joint Special Envoy of the United 
Nations and the League of Arab States that the first step in the cessation of violence 
must be made by the Syrian authorities, and therefore calls upon the Syrian 
authorities to fulfil immediately their commitment to cease the use of heavy 
weapons and complete the withdrawal of their troops and heavy weapons to their 
barracks; 

 6. Calls upon the Syrian authorities to immediately put an end to all human 
rights violations and attacks against civilians, protect its population, fully comply 
with its obligations under applicable international law and fully implement all 
relevant Human Rights Council resolutions as well as General Assembly resolutions 
66/176 and 66/253; 

 7. Demands that the Syrian authorities strictly observe their obligations 
under international law with respect to chemical and biological weapons, including 
Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) of 28 April 2004 and the Protocol for the 
Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of 
Bacteriological Methods of Warfare, signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925,3 and further 
demands that the Syrian authorities refrain from using, or transferring to non-State 
actors, any chemical or biological weapons, or any related material, and that the 
Syrian authorities meet their obligations to account for and to secure all chemical 
and biological weapons and any related material; 
 
 

  Accountability 
 
 

 8. Stresses again the importance of ensuring accountability and the need to 
end impunity and hold to account those responsible for human rights violations, 
including those violations that may amount to crimes against humanity;  

 9. Encourages the Security Council to consider appropriate measures in this 
regard; 

 10. Demands that the Syrian authorities provide the independent 
international commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic and individuals 
working on its behalf immediate entry and access to all areas of the Syrian Arab 
Republic, and demands also that all parties cooperate fully with the commission of 
inquiry in the performance of its mandate; 
 
 

  Humanitarian situation 
 
 

 11. Deplores the deteriorating humanitarian situation and the failure to 
ensure safe and timely provision of humanitarian assistance to all areas affected by 
the fighting, in violation of point 3 of the six-point plan, which, therefore, is 
contrary to Security Council resolutions; 

 12. Calls upon the Syrian authorities to immediately and fully implement the 
agreed humanitarian response plan, including by granting immediate, safe, full and 
unimpeded access of humanitarian personnel to all populations in need of 
assistance, in particular to civilian populations in need of evacuation, as well as 
safe, full and unimpeded access for affected civilians to humanitarian assistance and

internally displaced persons as a result of the ongoing violence, and reiterates its 
appreciation of the significant efforts that have been made by the States bordering 
Syria to assist those who have fled across Syria’s borders as a consequence of the 
violence, and requests the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees to provide assistance as requested by Member States receiving these 
displaced persons; 

 15. Invites Member States to provide all support to the Syrian people, and 
encourages Member States to contribute to the United Nations humanitarian 
response efforts; 
 
 

  Political transition

democratic, pluralistic political system, in which citizens are equal regardless of 
their affiliations or ethnicities or beliefs, including through the commencement of a 
serious political dialogue between the Syrian authorities and the whole spectrum of 
the Syrian opposition; 

 17. Demands, in this regard, that all Syrian parties work with the Office of 
the Joint Special Envoy to implement rapidly the transition plan set forth in the final 
communiqué issued by the Action Group on 30 June, in a way that assures the safety 
of all in an atmosphere of stability and calm, notably through the establishment of a 
consensus transitional governing body, the review of the Constitution on the basis of 
an inclusive national dialogue, and free and fair multiparty elections held in the 
framework of this new constitutional order; 

 18. Welcomes, in this regard, the Syrian Opposition Conference held under 
the auspices of the League of Arab States in Cairo on 3 July 2012, as part of the 
efforts of the League of Arab States to engage the whole spectrum of the Syrian 
opposition, and encourages greater cohesion among the opposition;

mechanism for the implementation of the transition to a pluralistic, democratic civil 
State with equality in citizenship and freedoms;
