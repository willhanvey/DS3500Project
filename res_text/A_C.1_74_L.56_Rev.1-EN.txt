 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its previous relevant resolutions,  

 Recognizing the common interest of all humankind in strengthening and 

developing the system of arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation treaties 

and agreements, 

 Stressing the vital importance of efforts in arms control, disarmament and 

non-proliferation for providing international peace and strengthening global security, 

 Stressing also the paramount importance of full and strict implementation, 

strengthening and development of arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation 

treaties and agreements providing enhanced security to individual nations and the 

international community, 

 Underlining that any weakening of confidence in and compliance with such 

treaties and agreements diminishes their contribution to global or regional stability 

and undermines the credibility and effectiveness of the international legal system and 

regime applicable to arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation, 

 Recognizing in this context that full implementation by Member States of 

existing treaties and agreements to which they are parties and resolving 

implementation concerns effectively by means consistent with such treaties and 

agreements and international law facilitate the conclusion of additional arms control, 

disarmament and non-proliferation treaties and agreements, and thereby contribute to 

better relations among States and the strengthening of the existing system of such 

treaties and agreements, as well as international peace and security, 

 Believing that supporting and developing the system of arms control, 

disarmament and non-proliferation through the strengthening of appropriate treaties 



A/C.1/74/L.56/Rev.1 
 

 

19-18902 2/3 

 

and agreements and their regimes is a matter of interest and concern to all members 

of the international community, and noting the role that the United Nations has played 

and should continue to play in that regard,  

 Stressing the importance of appropriate and sustainable financial support for the 

effectiveness and efficiency of the relevant international arms control, disarmament 

and non-proliferation instruments and proper functioning of their regimes,  

 Emphasizing the importance of appropriate technical assistance and capacity-

building efforts for the implementation of arms control, disarmament and 

non-proliferation treaties and agreements by Member States,  

 Concerned that any actions that undermine the existing system of arms control, 

disarmament and non-proliferation treaties and agreements affect the interests of the 

international community, 

 Mindful that it is the responsibility and obligation of all Member States to 

contribute to the process of easing international tension and to strengthening 

international peace and security and, in this connection, to refrain from steps that 

negatively affect the security environment and to make efforts to advance along the 

path of nuclear disarmament, as well as general and complete disarmament under 

strict and effective international control,  

 1. Urges all States parties to arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation 

treaties and agreements to implement all provisions of such treaties and agreements 

in their entirety; 

 2. Calls for continued efforts to strengthen the system of arms control, 

disarmament and non-proliferation treaties and agreements and to preserve its 

integrity and validity for maintaining global stability and international peace and 

security; 

 3. Calls upon all Member States to give serious consideration to the negative 

implications of undermining arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation treaties 

and agreements and their regimes for international security and stability, as well as 

for progress in the field of disarmament; 

 4. Urges all Member States to support efforts aimed at the resolution of 

implementation issues by means consistent with arms control, disarmament and 

non-proliferation treaties and agreements and international law, with a view to 

encouraging strict observance by all States parties of the provisions of such treaties 

and agreements, maintaining or restoring the integrity of such treaties and agreements 

and strengthening and developing their regimes;  

 5. Considers that any actions that undermine the system of arms control, 

disarmament and non-proliferation treaties and agreements also undermine global 

stability and international peace and security;  

 6. Supports efforts by the international community, in the light of emerging 

developments, towards safeguarding the integrity of the existing arms control, 

disarmament and non-proliferation treaties and agreements, which is in the strongest 

interest of humankind; 

 7. Welcomes the role that the United Nations has played and continues to play 

in fostering negotiations on arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation treaties 

and agreements; 

 8. Expresses the need to maintain the effectiveness and efficiency as well as 

the consensus-based nature of the relevant multilateral instruments in the field of 

disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control; 



 
A/C.1/74/L.56/Rev.1 

 

3/3 19-18902 

 

 9. Requests the Secretary-General to continue to provide assistance that may 

be necessary in protecting the integrity of arms control, disarmament and 

non-proliferation treaties and agreements, and in strengthening the system of such 

treaties and agreements;

assistance and capacity-building in support of national implementation of arms 

control, disarmament and non-proliferation treaties and agreements by Member 

States; 

 11. Encourages efforts by all States parties to elaborate additional cooperative 

measures, as appropriate, that can increase confidence in existing arms control, 

disarmament and non-proliferation treaties and agreements and facilitate the 

conclusion of additional treaties and agreements of that kind;  

 12. Notes the importance of effective verification provisions for arms control , 

disarmament and non-proliferation treaties and agreements;  

 13. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-fifth session, 

under the item entitled “General and complete disarmament”, a sub-item entitled 

“Strengthening and developing the system of arms control, disarmament and 

non-proliferation treaties and agreements”.
