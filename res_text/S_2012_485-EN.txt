  France, Germany and United States of America: draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions and the statements of its President 
concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 

 Reaffirming its commitment to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and 
political independence of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 

 Stressing the primary responsibility of the Government of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo for ensuring security in its territory and protecting its 
civilians with respect for the rule of law, human rights and international 
humanitarian law, 

 Acknowledging that there have been positive developments relative to the 
consolidation of peace and stability across the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
but stressing that serious challenges remain, particularly in the eastern provinces, 
including the continued presence of armed groups in the Kivus and Oriental 
Province, serious abuses and violations of human rights and acts of violence against 
civilians, limited progress in building professional and accountable national security 
and rule of law institutions, and illegal exploitation of natural resources,  

 Expressing deep concern at the deteriorating security situation in the eastern 
provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including attacks by armed 
groups, attacks on peacekeepers and humanitarian personnel, which have restricted 
humanitarian access to conflict areas where vulnerable civilian populations reside, 
and the displacement of tens of thousands of civilians, and calling on all armed 
groups to cease hostilities, including all acts of violence committed against 
civilians, and urgently facilitate unhindered humanitarian access, 

 Stressing the need for the Congolese authorities to address the irregularities 
and challenges identified by national and international observers during the 
presidential and general elections on 28 November 2011 as well as the need to hold 
provincial and local elections in a timely, inclusive, peaceful, credible and 
transparent manner, 

 Encouraging the enhanced regional cooperation in the Great Lakes region and

importance of economic development to ensure long-term stabilization and peace 
consolidation, and stressing the need for sustained international support to ensure 
early recovery activities and lay the foundations for sustainable development, 

 Emphasizing that the linkage between the illicit exploitation and trade of 
natural resources and the proliferation and trafficking of arms is among the major 
factors fuelling and exacerbating conflicts in the Great Lakes region, urging all 
States, particularly those in the region, to implement fully the measures set out by 
its resolution 1896 (2009), reiterating its determination to continue to closely 
monitor the implementation and compliance with the measures set out by the

against the Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda (FDLR) leaders residing 
in their countries, 

 Remaining greatly concerned by the humanitarian situation and the persistent 
high levels of violence and human rights abuses and violations against civilians, 
condemning in particular the targeted attacks against civilians, widespread sexual 
and gender-based violence, recruitment and use of children by parties to the conflict, 
in particular the mutineers of ex-Congrès National pour la Défense du Peuple 
(ex-CNDP) and the 23 March Movement (M23), the displacement of significant 
numbers of civilians, extrajudicial executions and arbitrary arrests and their 
deleterious effect on the stabilization, reconstruction and development efforts in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, reiterating the urgent need for the swift 
prosecution of all perpetrators of human rights abuses and international 
humanitarian law violations, urging the Government of the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo, in cooperation with the United Nations, the International Criminal Court 
and other relevant actors, to implement the appropriate responses to address these 
challenges and to provide security, medical, legal, humanitarian and other assistance 
to victims,

Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict pertaining to parties in the 
armed conflict of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, especially in relation to 
the adoption of an action plan to put an end to the recruitment and use of children,  

 Welcoming the efforts of MONUSCO and international partners in delivering 
training in human rights, child protection and protection from sexual and gender-
based violence for Congolese security forces and underlining its importance, 

 Condemning all attacks against United Nations peacekeepers and humanitarian

bears primary responsibility for security, national reconciliation, peacebuilding and 
development in the country, and encourages the Government of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo to remain fully committed to protecting the civilian 
population through the establishment of professional, accountable and sustainable 
security forces, the deployment of Congolese civil administration, in particular the 
police, judicial personnel and territorial administration and the establishment of rule 
of law and respect for human rights, and encourages the Government to promote

S/2012/485  
 

12-39325 4

Orientale Province, resulting in reducing to a minimum the threat from armed 
groups and restoring stability in sensitive areas;

Congo, to engage in a new strategic partnership with MONUSCO in the area of SSR
