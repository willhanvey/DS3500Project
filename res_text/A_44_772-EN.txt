United Nations in the sphere of disarmament, to the attainment of which it has
repeatedly assigned the highest priority,

S.tr.a&n.g  that on eight different occasions it has condemned such tests
in the strongest terms and that, since 1974, it has stated its conviction that
the continuance of nuclear-weapon testing will intensify the arms race,  thus
increasing the danger of nuclear war,

Re.call_ing that the Secretary-General, addressing a plenary meeting of the
General Assembly on 12 December 1984, after appealing for a renewed effort
towards a comprehensive test-ban treaty, emphasised that no single
multilateral agreement could have a greater effect on limiting the further
refinement of nuclear weapons and that a comprehensive test-ban treaty is the
litmus test of the real willingness to pursue nuclear disarmament, 21

Taking...iatae. .a.c~j,~nL that the three nuclear-weapon States that act as
depositaries of the 1963 Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the
Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water 91 undertook in article I of that
Treaty to conclude A treaty resulting in the permanent banning of all
nuclear-test explosions, including all those explosions underground, and that
such an undertaking was reiterated in 1968 in the preamble to the Treaty on
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, 41 art ic le  VI of  which further
embodies their solemn and legally binding commitment to take effective
mnaaures  relating to cessation of the nuclear-arms race at an early date and
to nuclear disarmament,

Ncting that the Third Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, in its Final Declaration 51 adopted
on 21 September 1485, called upon the nuclear-weapon States parties to the
Treaty to resume trilateral negotiations in 1985 and upon all the
nuclear-weapon States to participate in the urgent negotiation and conclusion
of a comprohcnsive nuclear-test-ban treaty, as a matter of the highest
priority, in the Conference on Disarmament,
