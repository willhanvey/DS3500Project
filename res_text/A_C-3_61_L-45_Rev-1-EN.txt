 Mindful of all its resolutions on the subject of extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions and the resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights on the 
subject, 

 Noting with deep concern that impunity continues to be a major cause of the 
perpetuation of violations of human rights, including extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions, 

 Acknowledging that international human rights law and international 
humanitarian law are complementary and not mutually exclusive, 

 Noting with deep concern the growing number of civilians and persons hors de 
combat killed in situations of armed conflict and internal strife, 

 Acknowledging that extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions may under 
certain circumstances amount to genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes, 
as defined in international law, including in the Rome Statute of the International 
Criminal Court,4 

 Affirming the obligation of States to prevent the abuse of persons deprived of 
their liberty and to investigate and respond to deaths in custody, 

 Convinced of the need for effective action to prevent, combat and eliminate the 
abhorrent practice of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, which 
represent a flagrant violation of the right to life, 

 1. Strongly condemns once again all the extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions that continue to occur throughout the world; 

 2. Demands that all States ensure that the practice of extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions is brought to an end and that they take effective action to 
prevent, combat and eliminate the phenomenon in all its forms; 

 3. Reiterates the obligation of all States to conduct exhaustive and impartial 
investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions, to identify and bring to justice those responsible, while ensuring the 
right of every person to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and 
impartial tribunal established by law, to grant adequate compensation within a 
reasonable time to the victims or their families, and to adopt all necessary measures, 
including legal and judicial measures, to put an end to impunity and to prevent the 
further occurrence of such executions, as recommended in the Principles on the 
Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extralegal, Arbitrary and Summary 
Executions;5 

 4. Calls upon all States in which the death penalty has not been abolished to 
comply with their obligations under relevant provisions of international human 
rights instruments, including in particular articles 6, 7 and 14 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights2 and articles 37 and 40 of the Convention on

 5. Urges all States: 

 (a) To take all necessary and possible measures, in conformity with 
international human rights law and international humanitarian law, to prevent loss of 
life, in particular that of children, during public demonstrations, internal and 
communal violence, civil unrest, public emergencies or armed conflicts, and to 
ensure that the police, law enforcement agents, armed forces and other agents acting 
on behalf of or with the consent or acquiescence of the State, act with restraint and 
in conformity with international humanitarian law and international human rights 
law, including the principles of proportionality and necessity, and in this regard to 
ensure that police and law enforcement officials are guided by the Code of Conduct 
for Law Enforcement Officials7 and the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and 
Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials;8 

 (b) To ensure the effective protection of the right to life of all persons under 
their jurisdiction and to investigate promptly and thoroughly all killings, including 
those targeted at specific groups of persons, such as racially motivated violence 
leading to the death of the victim, killings of members of national, ethnic, religious 
or linguistic minorities, of refugees, internally displaced persons, migrants, street 
children or members of indigenous communities, killings of persons for reasons 
related to their activities as human rights defenders, lawyers, journalists or 
demonstrators, killings committed in the name of passion or in the name of honour, 
all killings committed for any discriminatory reason, including sexual orientation, as 
well as all other cases where a person’s right to life has been violated, and to bring 
those responsible to justice before a competent, independent and impartial judiciary 
at the national, or where appropriate, international level, and to ensure that such 
killings, including those committed by security forces, police and law enforcement 
agents, paramilitary groups or private forces, are neither condoned nor sanctioned 
by State officials or personnel; 

 6. Also urges all States to ensure that persons deprived of their liberty are 
treated humanely and with full respect for their human rights and to ensure that their 
treatment, including judicial guarantees, and conditions conform to the Standard 
Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners,9 and where applicable, to the 
Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949,3 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 
8 June 197710 in relation to all persons detained in armed conflict, as well as to 
other pertinent international instruments; 

 7. Welcomes the International Criminal Court as an important contribution 
to ending impunity concerning extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and 
the fact that one hundred and two States have already ratified or acceded to and a 
further thirty-seven have signed the Rome Statute of the Court4 and calls upon all

those States that have not ratified or acceded to the Rome Statute to consider doing 
so; 

 8. Encourages Governments and intergovernmental and non-governmental 
organizations to organize training programmes and to support projects with a view 
to training or educating military forces, law enforcement officers and government 
officials in human rights and humanitarian law issues connected with their work and 
to include a gender and child rights perspective in such training, and appeals to the 
international community and requests the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to support endeavours to that end; 

 9. Takes note of the interim report of the Special Rapporteur to the General 
Assembly;11 

 10. Commends the important role that the Special Rapporteur plays towards 
the elimination of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, and encourages 
the Special Rapporteur to continue, within his mandate, to collect information from 
all concerned, to respond effectively to reliable information that comes before him, 
to follow up on communications and country visits and to seek the views and 
comments of Governments and to reflect them, as appropriate, in his reports; 

 11. Acknowledges the important role of the Special Rapporteur in identifying 
cases where extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions could amount to 
genocide and crimes against humanity or war crimes, and urges him to collaborate 
with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and, as appropriate, 
the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide, in 
addressing situations of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions that are of 
particularly serious concern or in which early action might prevent further 
deterioration; 

 12. Welcomes the cooperation established between the Special Rapporteur 
and other United Nations mechanisms and procedures in the field of human rights, 
and encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue efforts in that regard; 

 13. Urges all States, in particular those that have not done so, to cooperate 
with the Special Rapporteur so that his mandate can be carried out effectively, 
including by favourably and rapidly responding to requests for visits, mindful that 
on-site country visits are an indispensable component of the mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur, and by responding in a timely manner to communications and other 
requests transmitted to them by the Special Rapporteur; 

 14. Expresses its appreciation to those States that have received the Special 
Rapporteur, and asks them to examine carefully the recommendations made by the 
Special Rapporteur, invites them to inform him of the actions taken on those 
recommendations and requests other States to cooperate in a similar way; 

 15. Again requests the Secretary-General to continue to use his best 
endeavours in cases where the minimum standards of legal safeguards provided for 
in articles 6, 9, 14 and 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
appear not to have been respected;
