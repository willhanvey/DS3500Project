 The Security Council,  

 Reaffirming its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international 

peace and security,  

 Reaffirming that terrorism in all forms and manifestations constitutes one of 

the most serious threats to international peace and security and that any acts of 

terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivations, whenever 

and by whomsoever committed,  

 Reaffirming further that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with 

any religion, nationality, or civilization,  

 Stressing that terrorism can only be defeated by a sustained and 

comprehensive approach involving the active participation and collaboration of all 

States and international and regional organizations to impede, impair, isolate and 

incapacitate the terrorist threat,  

 Gravely concerned by the financing of, and financial and other resources 

obtained by terrorists, and underscoring that these resources will support their future 

terrorist activities,  

 Reaffirming the need to prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts,  

 Expressing concern that terrorists benefit from transnational organized crime 

in some regions, including from the trafficking of arms, persons, drugs, and 

artefacts and from the illicit trade in natural resources including gold and other 

precious metals and stones, minerals, wildlife, charcoal and oil, as well as from 

kidnapping for ransom and other crimes including extortion and bank robbery,  

 Stressing that the development and maintenance of fair and effective criminal

mandates, and Member States to provide assistance and capacity-building towards 

Africa’s efforts to counter violent extremism and terrorism,  

 Gravely concerned that in some cases individuals, groups, undertakings and
