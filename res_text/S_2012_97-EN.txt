  United States of America: draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions and statements of its President concerning 
Sudan, 

 Reaffirming its commitment to the cause of peace throughout Sudan, to the 
sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Sudan, to the full and 
timely resolution of outstanding Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) issues, 
welcoming the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur, and recalling the importance of 
the principles of good neighbourliness, non-interference and cooperation in the 
relations among States in the region,  

 Recognizing that the Darfur conflict cannot be resolved militarily and a 
durable solution can only be obtained through an inclusive political process, 

 Reiterating its full support for efforts to reach a comprehensive and inclusive 
solution to the conflict in Darfur, and welcoming the Doha Document for Peace in 
Darfur as a basis for these efforts, the need for the completion of the political 
process, and an end to the violence and abuses in Darfur, 

 Urging the Government of Sudan and the Liberation and Justice Movement 
(LJM) to deliver on the commitments made in the Doha Document for Peace in 
Darfur, and urging all parties, in particular other armed movements who have not 
signed the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur, to indicate a willingness to 
negotiate without preconditions or further delays on the basis of the Doha Document 
for Peace in Darfur and fully participate in the Joint African Union/United Nations 
Mediation, 

 Welcoming the inauguration of the Darfur Regional Authority as an important 
step in the implementation of the Doha Document for Peace,  

 Demanding that the parties to the conflict exercise restraint and cease military 
action of all kind, including aerial bombardments,  

 Demanding an immediate and complete cessation by all parties to armed 
conflict of all acts of sexual violence against civilians in line with resolutions 1325 
(2000), 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009), and 1889 (2009); recruitment and use of children 
in line with resolutions 1998 (2011), 1612 (2005), and 1882 (2009); and 
indiscriminate attacks on civilians in line with resolution 1894 (2009), 



S/2012/97  
 

12-23581 2 
 

 Commending the efforts of, and reiterating its full support for, the United 
Nations/African Union Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID), the Joint African 
Union/United Nations Mediation, the United Nations Secretary-General, the African 
Union High Level Implementation Panel on Sudan, and the leaders of the region to 
promote peace and stability in Darfur, and expressing strong support for the political 
process under the African Union/United Nations-led mediation, 

 Urging enhanced cooperation and information sharing between UNAMID and 
the Panel of Experts, called for by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations’ 
guidelines and with the assistance of the UNAMID focal point,  

 Recalling the 28 June 2011 midterm report by the Panel of Experts appointed 
by the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 3 (b) of resolution 1591 (2005) and 
extended by subsequent resolutions, taking note of the Panel of Expert’s final report, 
and expressing its intent to study, through the Committee, the Panel’s 
recommendations and to consider appropriate next steps,  

 Expressing concern over the obstacles that have been imposed on the work of 
the Panel of Experts during the course of its last mandate, including delays in the 
issuance of visas and travel permits, and restrictions to the freedom of movement of 
the Panel of Experts and UNAMID,  

 Emphasizing the need to respect the provisions of the Charter concerning 
privileges and immunities, and the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of 
the United Nations, as applicable to United Nations operations and persons engaged 
in such operations, 

 Reminding all States, particularly States in the region, of the obligations 
contained in resolutions 1556 (2004), 1591 (2005), and 1945 (2010) in particular 
those obligations relating to arms and related materiel, 

 Stressing the necessity articulated in the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur 
that all Parties to the armed conflict in Darfur shall fully and unconditionally accept 
their obligations under international humanitarian law, international human rights 
law, and relevant Security Council resolutions, 

 Calling on the Government of Sudan to fulfil all its commitments, including 
lifting the state of emergency in Darfur, allowing free expression and undertaking 
effective efforts to ensure accountability for serious violations of international 
human rights and humanitarian law, by whomsoever perpetrated, 

 Emphasizing the imperative, highlighted in the Doha Document for Peace in 
Darfur, to refrain from all acts of violence against civilians, in particular vulnerable 
groups such as women and children, and from violations of human rights and 
international humanitarian law and the need to address the urgent humanitarian 
crisis faced by the people of Darfur, including the guarantee of unrestricted 
humanitarian access to all areas, 

 Noting that acts of hostility, violence or intimidation against the civilian 
population, including IDPs, in Darfur and other activities that could endanger or 
undermine the Parties’ commitment to a complete and durable cessation of 
hostilities would be inconsistent with the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur, 

 Determining that the situation in Sudan continues to constitute a threat to 
international peace and security in the region,
