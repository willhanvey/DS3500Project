sustainable development, and reaffirming that gender equality and the

energy,

challenging phase, with many downside risks, including net negative capital flows 

from some emerging and developing economies, continued low commodity prices, 

high unemployment, particularly among young people, and rising private and public 

indebtedness in many developing countries, and stressing the need for continuing 

efforts to address systemic fragilities and imbalances and to reform and strengthen 

the international financial system while implementing the reforms agreed upon to 

date in order to attend to those challenges and make progress towards sustaining 

global demand,
