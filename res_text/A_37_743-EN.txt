Noting rriti concern that the provisions of the Declaration on the
strengthening of International Securlty !i/ bave not been fully inplemented,

Profoundly disturbed by the continued escalation of tension in the uorld, the
ever nore frequent recourse to the threat or use of force, interventlon,
interference, aggression and foreign occulEtion, the continued staLemate in the
solution of crises in different regions and their aggravation, the continuous
escalation of the arrns race and nilltary build-up by najor powers, the trrrrsuance of
the Policy of rivalryl confrontation and contlnued atterryts to divide the world
into sPheres of influence and ddrination, the persistence of cotonialisn, racislr
and apartheid, the attenpts to distort the nature of national liberatlon struggles
and the lack of solution of the economic problens of developing countries, all of
which endanger international peace and security,

Deeplv concerned that the exacerbation of international tension has reached a
Point of deep crisis owing to the lack of progresa in the settlement of
international problems and conflicts and to the lack of progress in disarnanent,

AlarIIEd by the intensi fication, expansion of the scope and frequency of
nanoeuvres and otber rnilitary activities, which are assuning dangerous proportlons,
which are conceived within the context of big-Power confrontaticin and nrh ich are
used as an instrument of pressure against and threat to the independence of States
and liberation of Peoples struggling agalnst alien and colonial dominationr leading
to destabilization of international relations,

Noting with concern that the United Nations systen of collective securiCy ha6
nor b;;;-G?-;ET;ETI;all"

Avrare that international peace and security can be maintdined and strengthened
only on the basis of freedon, independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and
equality of states, as well as serf-detern ination of peopres under colonial and
foreign donination, respect for fundanental hurlEn rights and the development of
friendly relations anong States,

stressing the need for the main organs of the United l{atibns responsible for
the maintenance of peace and security, particuLarly the Security Councilr to
contribute nore effeceively to the promotion of j.nternational peace and security by
seeking solutions to the unresolved problens and crises in the 'world,

Enphasizing that the l,bvenent of NoFAligned countries hds sigmificantty
contributed to the struggle for national Liberation and to the efforta of the
Unit€d Nations towards the promotion of international peace and security, the
denccratization of international relations, the developrnent of international
co-operation and the establ-ishnent of a system of internatlonal relations based on
justice' sovereign equality and security of aII States and peobles r in accordance
with Che Purpose and principtes of the Charter of the Unlted Nations and the
principles and policy of non-alignrnent,
