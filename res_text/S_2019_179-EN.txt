 Reaffirming its primary responsibility under the Charter of the United Nations

States, and further recalling their responsibility to protect civilians and to respect 

human rights, as provided for by relevant international law, and further reaffirming

continuation of such conflicts and further noting the resolutions adopted and sanctions 

measures taken on this issue to support the prevention of illegal exploitation of natural 

resources, particularly timber, so-called “conflict minerals” like tin, tantalum, 

tungsten and gold, as well as diamonds, cobalt, charcoal and wildlife from fueling 

armed conflicts, and encouraging the AU member states to promote the transparent 

and lawful management of natural resources, including the adoption of government

of illegally owned weapons and arms,  

 Noting that achieving the goal of Silencing the Guns in Africa will contribute 

significantly to saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war, and further
