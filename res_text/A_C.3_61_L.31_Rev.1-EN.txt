  Belarus and Uzbekistan: draft resolution 
 
 

  Promotion of equitable and mutually respectful dialogue on 
human rights 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 the Vienna Declaration and 
Programme of Action,2 the International Covenants on Human Rights3 and other 
relevant human rights instruments, 

 Reaffirming that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in 
a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, and that 
the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical, 
cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind, 

 Stressing the importance of developing friendly relations among nations based 
on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and 
achieving international cooperation in promoting and encouraging respect for 
human rights and fundamental freedoms for all through international cooperation, 

 Emphasizing the responsibilities of all States, in conformity with the Charter, 
to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any 
kind of race, colour, sex, language or religion, political or other opinion, national or 
social origin, property, birth or other status, 

 Bearing in mind General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006 
entitled “Human Rights Council”, in particular the decision of the Assembly that the 
Human Rights Council should undertake a universal periodic review, in a manner 

__________________ 

 1  Resolution 217 A (III). 
 2  A/CONF.157/24 (Part I), chap. III.

A/C.3/61/L.31/Rev.1

that ensures universality of coverage and equal treatment with respect to all States, 
and the decision of the Human Rights Council4 on the establishment of an 
intersessional open-ended intergovernmental working group to develop the 
modalities of the universal periodic review mechanism, based on an interactive 
dialogue as well as on objective and reliable information, 

 Recalling that the General Assembly shall make recommendations for the 
purpose of promoting international cooperation in the economic, social, cultural, 
educational and health fields, and of assisting in the realization of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or 
religion, 

 Recognizing that politically motivated and biased country-specific resolutions 
on the situation of human rights severely undermine the principles of objectivity and 
non-selectivity in the consideration of human rights issues and are 
counterproductive to the cause of promoting human rights, 

 1. Urges Member States to further strengthen international cooperation in 
promoting and encouraging respect for human rights in order to enhance dialogue 
and broaden understanding among civilizations, cultures and religions; 

 2. Calls upon Member States to base their approaches towards development 
of international dialogue on human rights on the Charter of the United Nations, the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 Vienna Declaration and Programme of 
Action2 and other relevant international human rights instruments and to refrain 
from approaches that are inconsistent with that international framework; 

 3. Reaffirms that the promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, as a legitimate concern of the world community, and the 
development of international dialogue on human rights should be guided by the 
principles of universality, non-selectivity, impartiality and objectivity and should 
not be used for political purposes; 

 4. Stresses the need to avoid politically motivated and biased country-
specific resolutions on the situation of human rights, confrontational approaches, 
exploitation of human rights for political purposes, selective targeting of individual 
countries for extraneous considerations and double standards in the work of the 
United Nations on human rights issues; 

 5. Affirms that respect for political, economic and cultural diversity for all 
contributes to the development of stable and friendly relations among countries and 
equitable and mutually respectful international dialogue on human rights; 

 6. Stresses the continuing need for unbiased and objective information on 
the situation of human rights in all countries and the need to present this information 
in an impartial manner, including through the reports of the special rapporteurs and 
representatives, independent experts and working groups; 

 7. Decides to consider this matter at its sixty-second session under the item 
entitled “Human rights questions”.
