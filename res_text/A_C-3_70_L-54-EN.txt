will of the people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural 

systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives,  

 Reaffirming also that, while democracies share common features, there is no 

single model of democracy and that democracy does not belong to any country or

right to self-determination, 

 Stressing that democracy, development and respect for all human rights and

institutions and processes, including sending preliminary missions for that purpose,

in new democracies and countries undergoing democratization, in order to empower

promotion of democratization are provided only at the specific request of the 

Member State concerned, 

 Noting with satisfaction that increasing numbers of Member States are using 

elections as a peaceful means of discerning the will of the people, which builds 

confidence in representational governance and contributes to greater national peace 

and stability, and which may contribute to regional peace and stability,  

 Recalling the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted on 

10 December 1948,
4
 in particular the principle that the will of the people, as 

expressed through periodic and genuine elections, shall be the basis of government

representatives, and to vote and to be elected in genuine periodic elections, which 

shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, 

guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors,
