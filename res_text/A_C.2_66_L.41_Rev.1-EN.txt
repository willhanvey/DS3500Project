 Recalling further the 2005 World Summit Outcome,6 

 Recalling its resolution 65/178 of 20 December 2010 on agriculture 
development and food security, 

 Noting the previous work done by the Commission on Sustainable 
Development, in particular at its sixteenth and seventeenth sessions, highlighting the 
thematic focus on agriculture, 

 Acknowledging the work performed by the High-level Task Force on the 
Global Food Security Crisis, established by the Secretary-General in 2008, and 
specifically its call for increased investment, as appropriate, in the development of 
agricultural technology as well as for the transfer and use of existing technologies, 
on mutually agreed terms, especially for smallholder farmers, in particular rural 
women, and recalling the World Summit on Food Security, convened by the Food

 Recalling the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the 
Millennium Development Goals, held from 20 to 22 September 2010, and its 
outcome document,8 reaffirming its commitment to achieve the Millennium 
Development Goals, and recognizing the beneficial impact that the adoption of 
agricultural technologies can have for the achievement of many of those goals, 
including for eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, empowering women and 
ensuring environmental sustainability, while remaining concerned about the pace of 
progress to date in achieving those goals, particularly in the least developed 
countries and in Africa, 

 Taking note of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for 
the Decade 2011-20209 adopted at the Fourth United Nations Conference on the 
Least Developed Countries, held in Istanbul, Turkey, from 9 to 13 May 2011, and

in the Programme of Action, 

 Acknowledging the importance of the upcoming United Nations Conference on 
Sustainable Development, 

 Stressing the critical role of women in the agricultural sector and their 
contribution to enhancing agricultural and rural development, improving food 
security and nutrition and eradicating rural poverty, and underlining the fact that 
meaningful progress in agricultural development necessitates, inter alia, closing the 
gender gap and ensuring that women have equal access to agricultural technologies, 
related services and inputs and all the necessary productive resources, as well as to

 Acknowledging the role and work of civil society and the private sector in 
furthering progress in developing countries, in promoting the use of sustainable 
agricultural technology and the training of smallholder farmers, in particular rural 
women, 

 Considering the increasing need to innovate in agri-food chains in order to 
respond to the challenges posed by, inter alia, climate change, the depletion and 
scarcity of natural resources, urbanization and globalization, and recognizing that 
agricultural research and sustainable agricultural technologies can greatly contribute 
to agricultural, rural and economic development, the adaptation of agriculture and 
food security and nutrition and help to mitigate the negative impact of climate 
change, land degradation and desertification, 

 1. Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on agricultural technology 
for development;10 

 2. Urges Member States, relevant United Nations organizations and other 
stakeholders to strengthen efforts to improve the development of appropriate 
sustainable agricultural technologies and their transfer and dissemination under fair, 
transparent and mutually agreed terms to developing countries, especially least 
developed countries, in particular at the bilateral and regional levels, and to support 
national efforts to foster the utilization of local know-how and agricultural 
technologies, promote agricultural technology research and access to knowledge and 
information through suitable communication for development strategies and enable 
rural women, as well as men and youth, to increase sustainable agricultural 
productivity, reduce post-harvest losses and enhance food and nutritional security; 

 3. Encourages international, regional and national efforts to strengthen the 
capacity of developing countries, especially their smallholder farmers, in particular 
rural women, in order to enhance the productivity and nutritional quality of food 
crops, to promote sustainable practices in pre-harvest and post-harvest agricultural 
activities and to enhance food security and nutrition-related programmes and 
policies that take into consideration the specific needs of women and youth; 

 4. Calls upon Member States and relevant United Nations organizations and 
other stakeholders to mainstream gender into agricultural policies and projects and 
to focus on closing the gender gap to achieve equal access for women to labour-
saving technologies, agricultural technology information and know-how, equipment, 
decision-making forums and associated agricultural resources to ensure that 
agriculture, food security and nutrition-related programmes and policies take into 
consideration the specific needs of women and youth; 

 5. Underlines the importance of supporting and advancing research in 
improving and diversifying crop varieties and seed systems as well as supporting the 
establishment of sustainable agricultural systems and management practices, such as 
conservation agriculture and integrated pest management, in order to make 
agriculture more resilient and, in particular, to make crops and farm animals, 
including livestock, more tolerant to diseases, pests and environmental stresses,

 8. Calls upon Member States to include sustainable agricultural 
development as an integral part of their national policies and strategies, notes the 
positive impact that North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation can have 
in this regard, and urges the relevant bodies of the United Nations system to include 
elements of agricultural technology, research and development in efforts to achieve 
the Millennium Development Goals, with a focus on the research and development 
of technology that is affordable, durable and sustainable and that can be easily used 
by and disseminated to smallholder farmers, in particular rural women; 

 9. Requests relevant United Nations organizations, including the Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the International Fund for 
Agricultural Development, to promote, support and facilitate the exchange of 
experience among Member States on ways to augment sustainable agriculture and 
management practices, such as conservation agriculture, and increase the use of 
agricultural technologies that have a positive impact on the entire value chain, 
including technology for post-harvest crop storage and transportation, especially in 
pressing environmental circumstances; 

 10. Underlines the instrumental role of agricultural technology, agricultural 
research and technology transfer on mutually agreed terms, as well as the sharing of 
knowledge and practices, in furthering sustainable development and in achieving the 
Millennium Development Goals, calls, therefore, upon Member States and
