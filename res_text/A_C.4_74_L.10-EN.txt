Arrangements on 13 September 1993 by the Government of Israel and the Palestine

 1. Notes with regret that repatriation or compensation of the refugees, as 

provided for in paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), has not yet

be a matter of grave concern and the Palestine refugees continue to require assistance 

to meet basic health, education and living needs;

for Palestine has been unable to find a means of achieving progress in the 

implementation of paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), and 

reaffirms its request to the Conciliation Commission to continue exerting efforts 

towards the implementation of that paragraph and to report to the Assembly on the 

efforts being exerted in this regard as appropriate, but no later than 1 September 2020;  

 3. Affirms the necessity for the continuation of the work of the United 

Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and the 

importance of its unimpeded operation and its provision of services, including 

emergency assistance, for the well-being, protection and human development of the 

Palestine refugees and for the stability of the region, pending the just resolution of 

the question of the Palestine refugees;  

 4. Calls upon all donors to continue to strengthen their efforts to meet the 

anticipated needs of the Agency, including with regard to increased expenditures and 

needs arising from conflicts and instability in the region and the serious 

socioeconomic and humanitarian situation, particularly in the Occupied Palestinian 

Territory, and those needs mentioned in recent emergency, recovery and 

reconstruction appeals and plans for the Gaza Strip and in the regional crisis response 

plans to address the situation of Palestine refugees in the Syrian Arab Republic and 

those Palestine refugees who have fled to countries in the region;  

 5. Commends the Agency for its provision of vital assistance to the Palestine 

refugees and its role as a stabilizing factor in the region and the tireless efforts of the 

staff of the Agency in carrying out its mandate;
