 The General Assembly, 

 Bearing in mind its relevant resolutions, 

 Taking note of the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Conference of 

the International Atomic Energy Agency, the latest of which is resolution 

GC(58)/RES/16, adopted on 25 September 2014, 

 Cognizant that the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the region of the Middle 

East would pose a serious threat to international peace and security, 

 Mindful of the immediate need for placing all nuclear facilities in the region of 

the Middle East under full-scope safeguards of the Agency, 

 Recalling the decision on principles and objectives for nuclear 

non-proliferation and disarmament adopted by the 1995 Review and Extension 

Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 

Weapons on 11 May 1995,1 in which the Conference urged universal adherence to 

the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons2 as an urgent priority and 

called upon all States not yet parties to the Treaty to accede to it at the earliest date, 

particularly those States that operate unsafeguarded nuclear facilities,  

 Recognizing with satisfaction that, in the Final Document of the 2000 Review

Weapons,3 the Conference undertook to make determined efforts towards the 

achievement of the goal of universality of the Treaty, called upon those r emaining 

States not parties to the Treaty to accede to it, thereby accepting an international 

legally binding commitment not to acquire nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive 

devices and to accept Agency safeguards on all their nuclear activities, and 

underlined the necessity of universal adherence to the Treaty and of strict 

compliance by all parties with their obligations under the Treaty,  

 Recalling the resolution on the Middle East adopted by the 1995 Review and 

Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on 11 May 1995,
1
 in which the 

Conference noted with concern the continued existence in the Middle East of 

unsafeguarded nuclear facilities, reaffirmed the importance of the early realization 

of universal adherence to the Treaty and called upon all States in the Middle East 

that had not yet done so, without exception, to accede to the Treaty as soon as 

possible and to place all their nuclear facilities under full -scope Agency safeguards, 

 Noting with satisfaction that, in the Final Document of the 2010 Review 

Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 

Weapons,4 the Conference emphasized the importance of a process leading to full 

implementation of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East and decided, inter alia, 

that the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the co-sponsors of the 1995 

resolution, in consultation with the States of the region, would convene a conference 

in 2012, to be attended by all States of the Middle East, on the establishment of a 

Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass 

destruction, on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at by the States of the region 

and with the full support and engagement of the nuclear-weapon States, 

 Expressing regret that the conference was not convened in 2012 as mandated 

and that little progress has been achieved towards the implementation of the 

resolution on the Middle East adopted by the 1995 Review and Extension 

Conference of the Parties to the Treaty, 

 Taking note with appreciation of the note by the Secretary-General on the 

letters received from Member States confirming support for declaring the Middle 

East a region free from weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical 

and biological weapons, as contained in document A/68/781, 

 Recalling that Israel remains the only State in the Middle East that has not yet 

become a party to the Treaty,  

 Concerned about the threats posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons to 

the security and stability of the Middle East region,  

 Stressing the importance of taking confidence-building measures, in particular 

the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, in order to 

enhance peace and security in the region and to consol idate the global 

non-proliferation regime,  

 Emphasizing the need for all parties directly concerned to seriously consider 

taking the practical and urgent steps required for the implementation of the proposal

develop, produce, test or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons, to renounce possession
