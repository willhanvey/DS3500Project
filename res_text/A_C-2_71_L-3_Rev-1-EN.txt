Sustainable Development Goals and targets, its commitment to working tirelessly 

for the full implementation of the Agenda by 2030, its recognition that eradicating 

poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest 

global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, its 

commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions — 

economic, social and environmental — in a balanced and integrated manner, and to 

building upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seeking 

to address their unfinished business,  

 Reaffirming also its resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015 on the Addis Ababa 

Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for 

Development, which is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

Development, supports and complements it, helps to contextualize its means of  

implementation targets with concrete policies and actions, and reaffirms the strong 

political commitment to address the challenge of financing and creating an enabling 

environment at all levels for sustainable development in the spirit of global 

partnership and solidarity,  

 Recalling the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits 

in the economic, social and related fields, including the development goals and 

objectives contained therein, and recognizing the vital role played by those 

conferences and summits in shaping a broad development vision and in identifying 

commonly agreed objectives, 

 Stressing the need to fulfil all financing for development commitments, 

including those contained in the Monterrey Consensus of the International 

Conference on Financing for Development,
4
 the Doha Declaration on Financing for 

Development: outcome document of the Follow-up International Conference on 

Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey 

Consensus,
5
 the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and other relevant outcomes of major 

United Nations conferences and summits,  

 Noting that there have been systemic challenges to the global economic 

architecture demanding a review of global economic governance,  

 Concerned about the multiple interrelated and mutually exacerbating current 

global crises, in particular the world financial and economic crisis, volatile energy 

and commodity prices, the food crisis and the challenges posed by climate change, 

which have a negative impact on the development prospects of developing countries 

and threaten to further widen the gap between developed and developing countries, 

including the technological and income gap, and which could further undermine the 

achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the 

Sustainable Development Goals, 

 Also concerned, in this regard, that, although certain regions have made some 

progress, more than half of the workers in the developing world, about 1.5 billion 

people, live in vulnerable employment situations, and approximately one in five 

people in the developing regions live on less than 1.25 United States dollars a day,

 Further concerned about recent economic developments in the context of the 

continued challenges to achieving sustained economic growth, during which global 

exchange rate volatility intensified and global inflationary trends diverged, and that 

the weak prospects for the global economy put at risk vital public investment in 

education, health and action on climate change, as well as progress in poverty 

eradication, especially in developing countries,  

 Concerned that billions of the world’s citizens continue to live in poverty and 

are denied a life of dignity and that there are rising inequalities within and among 

countries and enormous disparities of opportunity, wealth and power,  

 Stressing the lack of strong coordinated international response in dealing with 

the challenges referred to above, illustrating that the calls made in the Declaration 

on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and the Programme of 

Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order are still highly 

relevant, 

 Underlining the need for a more sustainable economic growth and recovery, 

and recognizing that this goal can be achieved through inclusive multilateralism and 

the equal participation of all countries, as envisioned, inter alia, in the Declaration 

and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International 

Economic Order, 

 Recognizing that innovative and enhanced approaches to financing for 

development are needed to address the challenges posed by the current global 

economic situation, poverty and the achievement of the internationally agreed 

development goals, including the Sustainable Development Goals, and stressing that 

these approaches should neither be a substitute for nor negatively affect the level of 

traditional sources of development financing, including official development 

assistance, and that they need to be developed in a spirit of partnership, cooperation 

and solidarity, bearing in mind the common interests and national priorities of each 

country, 

 Recognizing also that many relevant aspects of the Programme of Action on 

the Establishment of a New International Economic Order have not been 

implemented and that, consequently, many developing countries continue to face 

significant challenges to their development prospects, including vulnerability to 

external shocks and lack of adequate representation in global economic governance,  

 Recognizing further the role played by regional, subregional and interregional 

cooperation as well as regional economic integration, based on equality of 

partnership, in strengthening international cooperation with the objective of 

facilitating economic coordination and cooperation for development, the 

achievement of development goals and the sharing of best practices and knowledge,  

 Recognizing that widespread financial deregulation has contributed to larger 

net capital outflows from developing countries to developed countries, 

 Concerned that excessively expansionary monetary policies and the ensuing 

competitive currency devaluations pursued by developed countries have an effect 

equivalent to an across-the-board export subsidy and a generalized increase in 

import tariffs, which thus nullify or impair existing World Trade Organization 

market access commitments and further hinder the capacity of developing countries

16-19230 4/5 

 

to fulfil their commitments to implement all the internationally agreed development 

goals, including the Sustainable Development Goals, 

 Stressing the need for policy space to allow for the formulation of national 

development strategies by developing countries, aimed at bringing prosperity for all,  

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General entitled “Updated 

overview of the major international economic and policy challenges for equitable 

and inclusive sustained economic growth and sustainable development, and of the 

role of the United Nations in addressing these issues in the light of the New 

International Economic Order”;
6
  

 2. Notes that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,
7
 the Addis 

Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for 

Development
8
 and the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations 

Framework Convention on Climate Change
9
 carry forward many of the ideas and 

recommendations of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International 

Economic Order
10

 and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New 

International Economic Order;
11

  

 3. Reaffirms the need to continue working towards a new international 

economic order based on the principles of equity, sovereign equality, 

interdependence, common interest, cooperation and solidarity among all States;  

 4. Reiterates that States are strongly urged to refrain from promulgating 

and applying any unilateral economic, financial or trade measures not in accordance 

with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that impede the full 

achievement of economic and social development, particularly in developing 

countries; 

 5.  Reaffirms that national development efforts need to be supported by an 

enabling international economic environment, including coherent and mutually 

supporting world trade, monetary and financial systems and strengthened and 

enhanced global economic governance, as well as by respect for each country’s 

policy space; 

 6. Also reaffirms the need to step up coordination of macroeconomic 

policies among countries to avoid negative spillover effects, especially in 

developing countries;  

 7. Calls for the fulfilment of the commitment to pursue policy coherence 

and an enabling environment for sustainable development at all levels and by all 

actors and to reinvigorate the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development;  

 8. Reaffirms the recommitment to broadening and strengthening the voice 

and participation of developing countries, including African countries, the least 

developed countries, landlocked developing countries, small island developing

States and middle-income countries, as well as countries and peoples under foreign 

occupation, in international economic decision-making, norm-setting and global 

economic governance; 

 9. Also reaffirms that international trade is an engine for development and 

sustained economic growth, and further reaffirms the critical role that a universal, 

rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system can 

play in stimulating economic growth and development worldwide, thereby 

benefiting all countries at all stages of development;  

 10. Decides to continue considering the international economic situation and 

its impact on development at its seventy-third session, and in that regard requests 

the Secretary-General to include in his report to the General Assembly, under the 

item entitled “Globalization and interdependence”, an updated overview of the 

major international economic and policy challenges for equitable and inclusive 

sustained economic growth and sustainable development and of the role of the 

United Nations in addressing those issues, as well as possible ways and means to 

overcome those challenges, bearing in mind the outcomes of the major United 

Nations conferences and summits in the economic, social and related fields and the 

principles contained therein, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in 

the light of the relevant principles contained in the Declaration on the Establishment 

of a New International Economic Order and the Programme of Action on the 

Establishment of a New International Economic Order.
