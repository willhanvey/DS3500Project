urge other States to do likewise, as called for by the General Assembly and other 

organs of the United Nations, and request States applying those measures or laws to 

revoke them fully and immediately,  

 Recalling also that, at the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna 

from 14 to 25 June 1993, States were called upon to refrain from any unilateral 

measure not in accordance with international law and the Charter that creates 

obstacles to trade relations among States and impedes the full realization of all 

human rights

States are strongly urged to refrain from promulgating and applying any unilateral 

economic, financial or trade measures not in accordance with international law and 

the Charter of the United Nations that impede the full achievement of economic and 

social development, particularly in developing countries,   

 Expressing concern about the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures 

on international relations, trade, investment and cooperation,  

 Expressing grave concern that, in some countries, the situation of children is 

adversely affected by unilateral coercive measures not in accordance with 

international law and the Charter that create obstacles to trade relations  among 

States, impede the full realization of social and economic development and hinder 

the well-being of the population in the affected countries, with particular 

consequences for women, children, including adolescents, the elderly and persons 

with disabilities,  

 Deeply concerned that, despite the recommendations adopted on this question 

by the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council, the Commission on Human 

Rights and recent major United Nations conferences, and contrary to general 

international law and the Charter, unilateral coercive measures continue to be 

promulgated and implemented, with all their negative implications for the social 

humanitarian activities and economic and social development of developing 

countries, including their extraterritorial effects, thereby creating additional 

obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals under 

the jurisdiction of other States,  

 Bearing in mind all the extraterritorial effects of any unilateral legislative, 

administrative and economic measures, policies and practices of a coercive nature 

against the development process and the enhancement of human rights in 

developing countries, which create obstacles to the full realization of all human 

rights,  

 Reaffirming that unilateral coercive measures are a major obstacle to the 

implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development,
14

  

 Recalling article 1, paragraph 2, common to the International Covenant on 

Civil and Political Rights
15

 and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 

Cultural Rights,
14

 which provides, inter alia, that in no case may a people be 

deprived of its own means of subsistence,  

 Noting the continuing efforts of the open-ended Working Group on the Right 

to Development of the Human Rights Council, and reaffirming in particular its 

criteria, according to which unilateral coercive measures are one of the obstacles to 

the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development,   

 1. Urges all States to cease adopting or implementing any unilateral 

measures not in accordance with international law, international humanitarian law, 

the Charter of the United Nations and the norms and principles governing peaceful 

relations among States, in particular those of a coercive nature, with all their 

extraterritorial effects, which create obstacles to trade relations among States, thus

impeding the full realization of the rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of 

Human Rights
16

 and other international human rights instruments, in particular the 

right of individuals and peoples to development;  

 2. Strongly urges States to refrain from promulgating and applying any 

unilateral economic, financial or trade measures not in accordance with 

international law and the Charter that impede the full achievement of  sustainable 

economic and social development, particularly in developing countries;   

 3. Condemns the inclusion of Member States in unilateral lists under false 

pretexts, which are contrary to international law and the Charter, including false 

allegations of terrorism sponsorship, considering such lists as instruments for 

political or economic pressure against Member States, particularly developing 

countries;  

 4. Urges all States not to adopt any unilateral measures not in accordance 

with international law and the Charter that impede the full achievement of economic 

and social development by the population of the affected countries, in particular 

children and women, that hinder their well-being and that create obstacles to the full 

enjoyment of their human rights, including the right of everyone to a standard of 

living adequate for his or her health and well-being and his or her right to food, 

medical care and education and the necessary social services, as well as to ensure 

that food and medicine are not used as tools for political pressure;  

 5. Strongly objects to the extraterritorial nature of those measures which, in 

addition, threaten the sovereignty of States, and in this context calls upon all 

Member States neither to recognize those measures nor to apply them, as well as to 

take administrative or legislative measures, as appropriate, to counteract the 

extraterritorial applications or effects of unilateral coercive measures;   

 6. Condemns the continuing unilateral application and enforcement by 

certain Powers of unilateral coercive measures, and rejects those measures, with all 

their extraterritorial effects, as being tools for political or economic pressure against 

any country, in particular against developing countries, adopted with a view to 

preventing those countries from exercising their right to decide,  of their own free 

will, their own political, economic and social systems, and because of the negative 

effects of those measures on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of 

their populations, in particular children, women, the elderly and  persons with 

disabilities;  

 7. Expresses grave concern that, in some countries, the situation of children 

is adversely affected by unilateral coercive measures not in accordance with 

international law and the Charter that create obstacles to trade relations among 

States, impede the full realization of social and economic development and hinder 

the well-being of the population in the affected countries, with particular 

consequences for women, children, including adolescents, the elderly and persons 

with disabilities;  

 8. Reaffirms that essential goods such as food and medicines should not be 

used as tools for political coercion and that under no circumstances should people 

be deprived of their own means of subsistence and development;

 9. Calls upon Member States that have initiated such measures to abide by 

the principles of international law, the Charter, the declarations of the United 

Nations and world conferences and relevant resolutions and to commit themselves 

to their obligations and responsibilities arising from the international human rights 

instruments to which they are parties by revoking such measures at the earliest 

possible time;  

 10. Reaffirms, in this context, the right of all peoples to self-determination, 

by virtue of which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their 

economic, social and cultural development;  

 11. Recalls that, according to the Declaration on Principles of International 

Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance 

with the Charter of the United Nations, contained in the annex to General Assembly 

resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970, and the relevant principles and 

provisions contained in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, 

proclaimed by the Assembly in its resolution 3281 (XXIX), in particular article 32 

thereof, no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other 

type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination 

of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind;  

 12. Rejects all attempts to introduce unilateral coercive measures, and urges 

the Human Rights Council to take fully into account the negative impact of those 

measures, including through the enactment and extraterritorial application of 

national laws that are not in conformity with international law, in its task concerning 

the implementation of the right to development;  

 13. Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in 

discharging his functions relating to the promotion, realization and protection of the 

right to development and bearing in mind the continuing impact of unilateral 

coercive measures on the population of developing countries, to give priority to the 

present resolution in his annual report to the General Assembly;  

 14. Underlines the fact that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major 

obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development,
13

 

and in this regard calls upon all States to avoid the unilateral imposition of 

economic coercive measures and the extraterritorial application of national laws that 

run counter to the principles of free trade and hamper the development of 

developing countries, as recognized by the open-ended Working Group on the Right 

to Development of the Human Rights Council;   

 15. Recognizes that, in the Declaration of Principles adopted at the first 

phase of the World Summit on the Information Society, held in Geneva from 10 to 

12 December 2003,
17

 States were strongly urged to avoid and refrain from any 

unilateral measure not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the 

United Nations in building the information society;  

 16. Reaffirms paragraph 30 of the outcome document of the United Nations 

summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, entitled 

“Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”,
12

protection of human rights, to pay due attention and to give urgent consideration to 

the present resolution;  

 19. Recalls that the Human Rights Council took note of the research-based 

progress report of its Advisory Committee containing recommendations on 

mechanisms to assess the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the 

enjoyment of human rights and to promote accountability;
18

  

 20. Takes note of the contribution of the first biennial panel discussion on the 

issue of unilateral coercive measures and human rights organized by the Human 

Rights Council in 2015 to increase awareness of the negative impact that unilateral 

coercive measures have on the enjoyment of human rights in the targeted and 

non-targeted countries, and invites the Council to follow up on the discussion at the 

upcoming second biennial panel in 2017;  

 21. Invites the Human Rights Council and the Office of the United Nations 

High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue paying attention and explore 

ways to address the negative impact of the application of unilateral coercive 

measures;  

 22. Reiterates its support for the invitation of the Human Rights Council to 

all special rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the Council in the field 

of economic, social and cultural rights to pay due attention, within the scope of their 

respective mandates, to the negative impact and consequences of unilateral coercive 

measures;  

 23. Takes note with interest of the proposals contained in the report of the 

Special Rapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the

impact of the application of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of

on women and children, in the States targeted;
