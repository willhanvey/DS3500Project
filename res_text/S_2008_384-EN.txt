  Draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 2 June 2008 (S/2008/353) on 
the United Nations operation in Cyprus, 

 Noting that the Government of Cyprus is agreed that in view of the prevailing 
conditions on the island it is necessary to keep UNFICYP beyond 15 June 2008, 

 Echoing the Secretary-General’s firm belief that the responsibility of finding a 
solution lies first and foremost with the Cypriots themselves, that there now exists 
an important window of opportunity to make decisive progress which must be fully 
utilized by all parties in the search for a comprehensive solution, and noting the 
primary role of the United Nations in assisting the parties to bring the Cyprus 
conflict and division of the island to a comprehensive and durable settlement, 

 Welcoming the agreement of 21 March and the Joint Statement of 23 May 2008 
which, inter alia, have demonstrated a renewed political willingness to support and 
engage fully and in good faith with the United Nations efforts, reaffirmed the 
commitment of the leaders to a bicommunal, bizonal federation with political 
equality, as set out in the relevant Security Council resolutions, and to consider 
further civilian and military confidence-building measures, 

 Welcoming the opening of the Ledra Street crossing which has helped foster 
greater trust and interaction between the two communities; reaffirming the 
importance of continued crossings of the Green Line by Cypriots, and encouraging 
the opening of other crossing points, 

 Welcoming the intention of the Secretary-General to appoint a Special Adviser 
at the appropriate time and to keep the Council informed of further developments 
and progress, 

 Taking note of the assessment of the Secretary-General that the security 
situation on the island and along the Green Line remains generally stable, 
welcoming the decrease in the overall number of incidents involving the two sides, 
and urging both sides to avoid any action, including restrictions on UNFICYP’s 
movements, which could lead to an increase in tension, 

 Welcoming the coordination arrangements agreed with the United Nations to 
address unauthorized construction within the buffer zone, including large-scale 
commercial projects, and echoing the Secretary-General’s firm belief that the

situation in the buffer zone would be improved if both sides accepted the 1989 aide-
memoire used by the United Nations, 

 Welcoming the agreement with the Turkish forces to proceed with demining 
activities, but urging that further guidelines be agreed to permit such activities to 
take place in all outstanding minefields; noting with concern that funding for the 
Mine Action Centre beyond 2008 has not yet been secured but that this work will 
need to continue beyond that period,  

 Welcoming the progress and continuation of the important activities of the 
Committee on Missing Persons; expressing the hope that this process will promote 
reconciliation between the communities, 

 Agreeing that an active and flourishing civil society is essential to the political 
process and welcoming all efforts to promote bicommunal contacts and events, 
including, inter alia, on the part of all United Nations bodies on the island, and 
urging the two sides to promote the active engagement of civil society and the 
encouragement of cooperation between economic and commercial bodies and to 
remove all obstacles to such contacts, 

 Reaffirming the importance of the Secretary-General continuing to keep the 
operations of UNFICYP under close review while continuing to take into account 
developments on the ground and the views of the parties, and reverting to the 
Council with recommendations as appropriate for further adjustments to 
UNFICYP’s mandate, force levels and concept of operation as soon as warranted,

General’s new Special Representative to Cyprus, and echoing the Secretary-
General’s appreciation for the work of the previous Special Representative, Michael 
Moller,

and the Government of Greece for their voluntary contributions to the funding of 
UNFICYP, and his request for further voluntary contributions from other countries 
and organizations, 

 Welcoming and encouraging efforts by the United Nations to sensitize 
peacekeeping personnel in the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS and other 
communicable diseases in all its peacekeeping operations,

months in the Secretary-General’s report;  

 2. Urges the parties to build on the present momentum and continue their 
efforts to identify to the greatest possible extent areas of convergence and

a view to reaching early agreement on outstanding issues; 

 6. Calls on the Turkish Cypriot side and Turkish forces to restore in 
Strovilia the military status quo which existed there prior to 30 June 2000; 

 7. Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report on implementation of

events as necessary;

ensure full compliance of its personnel with the United Nations code of conduct, 
requests the Secretary-General to continue to take all necessary action in this regard 
and to keep the Security Council informed, and urges troop-contributing countries to 
take appropriate preventive action including the conduct of predeployment
