  Draft resolution II  

  Question of American Samoa  
 

 

 The General Assembly,  

 Having considered the question of American Samoa and examined the relevant 

chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the 

Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial 

Countries and Peoples for 2018,1  

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on American 

Samoa2 and other relevant information,  

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are 

valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people  

of American Samoa and in conformity with the clearly defined principles contained 

in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV)of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of 

15 December 1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,  

 Expressing concern that 58 years after the adoption of the Declaration on the 

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, 3  there still remain 

17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including American Samoa,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2020 and the plans of action for the Second 4 and Third International 

Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism,  

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of 

American Samoa require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the options 

for self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical location, 

size of population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  

 Recalling the outcome of the referendum held on 4 November 2014, in which 

the proposal to give the Fono, the Territory’s legislature, the authority to override the 

Governor’s veto was rejected, and welcoming the discussion opened in the Territory 

as to the way forward,  

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-

Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the 

Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world economy 

and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that 

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views

of the people of American Samoa in respect of their right to self-determination should 

be ascertained,  

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the 

local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional 

organizations,  

 Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding 

of the political status of the people of American Samoa and to fulfil its mandate 

effectively, it is important for it to be apprised by the United States of  America as the 

administering Power and to receive information from other appropriate sources, 

including the representatives of the Territory, concerning the wishes and aspirations 

of the people of the Territory,  

 Aware of the importance both to American Samoa and to the Special Committee 

of the participation of elected and appointed representatives of American Samoa in 

the work of the Committee,  

 Recognizing the need for the Special Committee to ensure that the appropriate 

bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at 

assisting the people of American Samoa with their inalienable right to self -

determination and in gaining a better understanding of the options for self -

determination, on a case-by-case basis,  

 Mindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the 

Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 

representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 

the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the 

seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial element 

in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of 

the Territories,  

 Welcoming the Pacific regional seminar on the theme “Implementation of the 

Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism: towards the 

achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in the Non-Self-Governing 

Territories — social, economic and environmental challenges”, held by the Special 

Committee in Saint George’s and hosted by the Government of Grenada from 9 to 

11 May 2018, as a significant and forward-looking event, which enabled the 

participants to assess progress made and address challenges faced in the 

decolonization process, review the existing working methods of the Committee and 

renew its commitment to implementing its historic task,  

 Recognizing the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted 

by the seminar, which are annexed to the report of the Special Committee5 and which 

outline the findings of the seminar, including, especially, the way forward for the 

decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General 

Assembly of the period 2011–2020 as the Third International Decade for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,6  

 Noting with appreciation the contribution to the development of some 

Territories by the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations 

system, in particular the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, 

the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the United Nations 

Development Programme and the World Food Programme, as well as regional 

institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean Community, the

Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, the Pacific Islands Forum and the agencies 

of the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific,  

 Noting the statement made by a representative of the Governor of American 

Samoa at the 2018 Pacific regional seminar,7  

 Noting also the statement made by a representative of the Governor of American 

Samoa at the 2018 Pacific regional seminar, in which he expressed his view that the 

people of American Samoa were happy with the relationship with the administering 

Power, which could be described as strong and healthy as well as beneficial to the 

people and the Government of the Territory, and that the most important benefit to 

American Samoa had been the protection of its indigenous rights to the  land as 

provided for in the Deeds of Cession,  

 Noting further the statement made by a representative of the Governor of 

American Samoa at the 2018 Pacific regional seminar that the political status of 

American Samoa as an unincorporated and unorganized territory of the administering 

Power limited its ability to self-government and exposed it to decisions made by the 

administering Power,  

 Noting the statement by the representative that, while certain aspects of the form 

of government of the Territory and its relationship with the administering Power were 

challenging and in need of improvement, the solutions could be found within the 

confines of the political and judicial systems of the administering Power and that the 

territorial Government was pursuing legal actions to counteract the impact of 

unfavourable federal actions and sought the international community’s tacit support,  

 Noting also the information provided by the representative that the Government 

of American Samoa intended to pursue additional funding from the administering 

Power to maintain and expand the work of the Office of Political Status, 

Constitutional Review and Federal Relations,  

 Aware of the work of the Future Political Status Study Commission, completed 

in 2006, the release of its report, with recommendations, in January 2007 and the 

creation of the American Samoa Constitutional Review Committee, as well as the 

holding in June 2010 of the Territory’s fourth Constitutional Convention,  

 Recalling the decisions of the United States judiciary in which it dismissed a 

lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that would have asserted that the citizenship 

clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States extended 

to American Samoa, and taking note of the decision in which the petition for a writ 

of certiorari was denied,8  

 Recalling also the general election in the Territory which took place in 

November 2016,9  

 1. Reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of American Samoa to self -

determination, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and with General 

Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), containing the Declaration on the Granting of 

Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples;  

 2. Also reaffirms that, in the process of the decolonization of American 

Samoa, there is no alternative to the principle of self-determination, which is also a 

fundamental human right, as recognized under the relevant human rights conventions;

 3. Further reaffirms that it is ultimately for the people of American Samoa to 

determine freely their future political status in accordance with the relevant 

provisions of the Charter, the Declaration and the relevant resolutions of the General 

Assembly, and in that connection calls upon the administering Power, in cooperation 

with the territorial Government and appropriate bodies of the United Nations system, 

to develop political education programmes for the Territory in order to foster an 

awareness among the people of their right to self-determination in conformity with 

the legitimate political status options, based on the principles clearly defined in 

Assembly resolution 1541 (XV) and other relevant resolutions and decisions;  

 4. Takes note of the work of the territorial Government with respect to 

moving forward on political status, local autonomy and self-governance issues with 

a view to making political and economic progress, and recalls the establishment in 

April 2016 of the Office of Political Status, Constitutional Review and Federal 

Relations;  

 5. Recalls the indication by the territorial Government that American Samoa 

should remain on the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories, under the purview of the 

Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the 

Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, until 

such time as its people have exercised their right to self-determination;  

 6. Also recalls the invitation extended in 2015 by the Governor of American 

Samoa to the Special Committee to send a visiting mission to the Territory, calls upon 

the administering Power to facilitate such a mission if the territorial Government so 

desires, and requests the Chair of the Special Committee to take all the steps necessary 

to that end;  

 7. Requests the administering Power to assist the Territory by facilitating its 

work concerning a public awareness programme, consistent with Article 73 b of the 

Charter, and in that regard calls upon the relevant United Nations organizations to 

provide assistance to the Territory, if requested;  

 8. Stresses the importance of the Special Committee being apprised of the 

views and wishes of the people of American Samoa and enhancing its understanding 

of their conditions, including the nature and scope of the existing political and 

constitutional arrangements between American Samoa and the administering Power;  

 9. Calls upon the administering Power to participate in and cooperate fully 

with the work of the Special Committee in order to implement the provisions of 

Article 73 e of the Charter and the Declaration and in order to advise the Committee 

on the implementation of the provisions under Article 73 b of the Charter on efforts 

to promote self-government in American Samoa, and encourages the administering 

Power to facilitate visiting and special missions to the Territory;  

 10. Reaffirms the responsibility of the administering Power under the Charter 

to promote the economic and social development and to preserve the cultural identity 

of the Territory, and requests the administering Power to take steps to enlist and make 

effective use of all possible assistance, on both a bilateral and a multilateral basis, in 

the strengthening of the economy of the Territory;

of natural resources and ecosystems that supports, inter alia, economic, social and 

human development, while facilitating ecosystem conservation, regeneration, 

restoration and resilience in the face of new and emerging challenges, and strongly

 Having considered the question of the British Virgin Islands and examined the 

relevant chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the Situation wi th regard 

to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial 

Countries and Peoples for 2018,1  

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on the British 

Virgin Islands2 and other relevant information,  

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are 

valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people 

of the British Virgin Islands and in conformity with the clearly defined principles 

contained in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 

(XV) of 15 December 1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,  

 Expressing concern that 58 years after the adoption of the Declaration on the 

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, 3 there still remain 17 

Non-Self-Governing Territories, including the British Virgin Islands,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2020 and the plans of action for the Second 4 and Third International 

Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism,  

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of 

the British Virgin Islands require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the 

options for self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical  

location, size of population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-

Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the 

Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world economy 

and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that 

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories,  as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of the British Virgin Islands in respect of their right to self-determination 

should be ascertained,

Question of Guam 
 

 

 The General Assembly,  

 Having considered the question of Guam and examined the relevant chapter of 

the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the 

Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial 

Countries and Peoples for 2018,1  

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on Guam,2 which 

contained the information requested by the General Assembly in resolution 72/102 of 

7 December 2017, and other relevant information,  

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are 

valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people 

of Guam and in conformity with the clearly defined principles contained in General 

Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of 15 December 

1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,  

 Expressing concern that 58 years after the adoption of the Declaration on the 

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, 3 there still remain 17 

Non-Self-Governing Territories, including Guam,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2020 and the plans of action for the Second 4 and Third International 

Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism,  

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of 

Guam require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the options for self -

determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical location, size of 

population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,

Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the 

Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world economy 

and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that 

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of Guam in respect of their right to self-determination should be 

ascertained,

local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional 

organizations,  

 Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding 

of the political status of the people of Guam and to fulfil its mandate effectively, it is 

important for it to be apprised by the United States of America as the administering 

Power and to receive information from other appropriate sources, including the 

representatives of the Territory, concerning the wishes and aspirations of the people 

of the Territory,  

 Aware of the importance both to Guam and to the Special Committee of the 

participation of elected and appointed representatives of Guam in the work of the

assisting the people of Guam with their inalienable right to self-determination and in 

gaining a better understanding of the options for self-determination, on a case-by-

case basis,  

 Mindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the 

Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 

representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 

the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the 

seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial element 

in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of 

the Territories,  

 Welcoming the Pacific regional seminar on the theme “Implementation of the 

Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism: towards the

recalling that more than 11,000 native inhabitants have been registered in the Guam 

decolonization registry to vote in the plebiscite,  

 Noting, in this regard, the statement by a representative of the Governor of 

Guam at the 2018 Pacific regional seminar that, while the case on the plebiscite had 

put a strain on native rights and the ability to choose the political future of the people 

of Guam, Guam would continue to move forward in pursuing self-determination,  

 Recalling that the administering Power approved a grant to support the self-

determination education campaign in the Territory in March 2016,  

 Recalling also that, in a referendum held in 1987, the registered and eligible 

voters of Guam endorsed a draft Guam Commonwealth Act that would establish a 

new framework for relations between the Territory and the administering Power, 

providing for a greater measure of internal self-government for Guam and recognition 

of the right of the Chamorro people of Guam to self-determination for the Territory,  

 Aware that negotiations between the administering Power and the territorial 

Government on the draft Guam Commonwealth Act ended in 1997 and that Guam has 

subsequently established a non-binding plebiscite process for a self-determination 

vote by the eligible Chamorro voters,

 Noting the expressed desire of the territorial Government for a visiting mission 

by the Special Committee, as communicated to the Special Committee in August

 Recalling also the statement made by the Speaker of the thirty-third Guam 

legislature before the Fourth Committee at the seventieth session of the General 

Assembly that the most acute threat to the legitimate exercise of the decolonization

and noting the concern expressed regarding the effect of the escalating military 

activities and installations of the administering Power on Guam,  

 Recalling further its resolution 57/140 of 11 December 2002, in which it 

reiterated that military activities and arrangements by administering Powers in the 

Non-Self-Governing Territories under their administration should not run counter to 

the rights and interests of the peoples of the Territories concerned, especially their 

right to self-determination, including independence, and called upon the 

administering Powers concerned to terminate such activities and to eliminate the 

remaining military bases in compliance with the relevant resolutions of the General 

Assembly,  

 Recalling its resolution 35/118 of 11 December 1980 and the territorial

Chamorros becoming a minority in their homeland,  

 Noting the legislative elections in the Territory which took place in November 

2016,8  

 1. Reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of Guam to self-

  Question of Montserrat 
 

 

 The General Assembly,  

 Having considered the question of Montserrat and examined the relevant 

chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the 

Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial 

Countries and Peoples for 2018,1   

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on Montserrat 2 and 

other relevant information,  

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are 

valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people 

of Montserrat and in conformity with the clearly defined principles contained in 

General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of 

15 December 1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,  

 Expressing concern that 58 years after the adoption of the Declaration on the 

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, 3  there still remain 

17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including Montserrat,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2020 and the plans of action for the Second 4 and Third International 

Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism,  

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of 

Montserrat require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the options for 

self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical location, 

size of population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an  

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-

Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the 

Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world economy 

and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that 

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of Montserrat in respect of their right to self -determination should be 

ascertained,

enduring consequences for the economy of the island,

  Question of Tokelau 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Having considered the question of Tokelau, 

 Taking note of the chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the 

Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of 

Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for 2018 relating to Tokelau, 1  

 Recalling its resolution 1514 (XV)of 14 December 1960, containing the 

Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, and 

all resolutions and decisions of the United Nations relating to Non-Self-Governing 

Territories, in particular General Assembly resolution 72/107 of 7 December 2017, 

 Noting with appreciation the continuing exemplary cooperation of New Zealand 

as the administering Power with regard to the work of the Special Committee relating 

to Tokelau and its readiness to permit access by United Nations visiting missions to 

the Territory, 

 Noting with appreciation also the collaborative contribution to the development 

of Tokelau by New Zealand and the specialized agencies and other organizations of 

the United Nations system, in particular the United Nations Development Programme 

and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,  

 Bearing in mind that, as a small island Territory, Tokelau exemplifies the 

situation of most remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories and that, as a case study 

pointing to successful cooperation for decolonization, Tokelau has wider significance 

for the United Nations as it seeks to complete its work in decolonization,  

 Recalling the status of Tokelau as an associate member of the Food and 

Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,  

 Acknowledging the World No Tobacco Day Award for the western Pacific region

“Tobacco-Free Tokelau by 2020”, and expressing hope that this could contribute to 

the well-being of the Territory and its peoples,  

 Cognizant that New Zealand and Tokelau signed, on 21 November 2003, a 

document entitled “Joint statement of the principles of partnership”, which sets out 

the rights and responsibilities of the two partners,  

 Bearing in mind the decision of the General Fono at its meeting in November 

2003, following extensive consultations undertaken in all three villages, to explore 

formally with New Zealand the option of self-government in free association, its 

decision in August 2005 to hold in February 2006 a referendum on self -determination 

on the basis of a draft constitution for Tokelau and a draft treaty of free association 

with New Zealand, and its subsequent decision to hold a further referendum in 

October 2007, and bearing in mind also that the two referendums did not produce the 

two-thirds majority of valid votes cast required by the General Fono to change the 

status of Tokelau from that of a Non-Self-Governing Territory under the 

administration of New Zealand, 

 Recalling the holding of free and fair elections in the Territory in January 2017,

statement for the Pacific regional seminar held in Saint George’s from 9 to 11 May 

2018 that the self-determination process of the Territory could not be addressed in 

isolation from the threat of climate change, the rise in sea level and the challenges to 

the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,2 and bearing in mind the intention of 

Tokelau to articulate its development and other priorities in the National Strategic 

Plan for 2016–2020, including consideration of the issue of self-determination and 

how it would prepare for a possible referendum on self-determination in cooperation

medical evacuations and general transport between the atolls,  

 1. Acknowledges the decision of the General Fono in 2008 that consideration 

of any future act of self-determination by Tokelau will be deferred and that New 

Zealand and Tokelau will devote renewed effort and attention to ensuring that 

essential services and infrastructure on the atolls of Tokelau are enhanced and 

strengthened, thereby ensuring an enhanced quality of life and opportunities for the 

people of Tokelau; 

 2. Welcomes the progress made towards the devolution of power to the three

  Draft resolution XIV  

  Question of the Turks and Caicos Islands 
 

 

 The General Assembly,  

 Having considered the question of the Turks and Caicos Islands and examined 

the relevant chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with 

regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independ ence to 

Colonial Countries and Peoples for 2018,1  

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on the Turks and 

Caicos Islands2 and other relevant information,  

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are 

valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people 

of the Turks and Caicos Islands and in conformity with the clearly defined principles 

contained in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV)of 14 December 1960, 1541 

(XV) of 15 December 1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,  

 Expressing concern that 58 years after the adoption of the Declaration on the 

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, 3  there still remain 

17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including the Turks and Caicos Islands,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2020 and the plans of action for the Second4 and Third International 

Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism,  

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of 

the Turks and Caicos Islands require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to 

the options for self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, 

geographical location, size of population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-

Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the 

Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world economy 

and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that 

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of the Turks and Caicos Islands in respect of their right to self -

determination should be ascertained,

organizations, 

 Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding 

of the political status of the people of the Turks and Caicos Islands and to fulfil its 

mandate effectively, it is important for it to be apprised by the United Kingdom of 

Great Britain and Northern Ireland as the administering Power and to receive 

information from other appropriate sources, including the representatives of the 

Territory, concerning the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory,  

 Aware of the importance both to the Turks and Caicos Islands and to the Special 

Committee of the participation of elected and appointed representatives of the Turks 

and Caicos Islands in the work of the Committee,  

 Recognizing the need for the Special Committee to ensure that the appropriate 

bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at 

assisting the people of the Turks and Caicos Islands with their inalienable right to 

self-determination and in gaining a better understanding of the options for self -

determination, on a case-by-case basis,  

 Mindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the 

Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 

representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 

the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional  nature of the 

seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial element 

in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of 

the Territories,  

 Welcoming the Pacific regional seminar on the theme “Implementation of the 

Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism: towards the

renew its commitment to implementing its historic task,

by the seminar, which are annexed to the report of the Special Committee 5 and which 

outline the findings of the seminar, including, especially, the way forward for the 

decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General 

Assembly of the period 2011–2020 as the Third International Decade for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,6

system, in particular the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, 

the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the United Nations 

Development Programme and the World Food Programme, as well as regional

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of the United States Virgin Islands in respect of their  right to self-
