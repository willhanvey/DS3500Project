The General Assembly, 

Deeply concerned at the persistence of inflation and monetary 
instability in the developed countries in which the United Nations incurs 
expenditure, 

Considering the responsibility borne by the developed countries in which 
the United Nations has headquarters for the generation of their own internal 
inflation and for readjustments and fluctuations in the exchange rates of 
their currencies, 

Considering further the economic advantages which those developed 
countries derive from the presence of the headquarters of United Nations 
bodies in their territory, 

Reco[';nizing that countries which are not responsible for inflation in, 
and readjustments and fluctuations in the exchange rates of, developed 
countries in which United Nations bodies have headquarters should not defray 
the cost of the losses occasioned thereby, 

Taking into account the fact that the losses sustained by the United 
Nations as a result of internal inflation in, and readjustments and 
fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies of, developing countries 
in which it has headquarters are relatively small, 

Taking into account also that the provisions of this resolution shall

the requirements rnentioned in operative paragraph 3 of this resolution, 

Mindful of the provisions of Article 17 of the Charter of the United

Nations, 

1. Decides that the losses sustained by the United Nations as a result 
of inflation and monetary instability in the developed countries in which it 
has headquarters shall be covered in the followine:; way: 

(a) Eighty per cent of such losses shall be borne by the developed 
countries in which the United Nations has headquarters, in proportion to the 
expenditures incurred in those countries; 

(b) The remaining 20 per cent shall be borne by the other countries, 
pro~rated in shares determined by the scale of assessments approved by the 
General Assembly for the corresponding period~ 

2. Decides also that the losses sustained by the United Nations as a 
result of internal inflation in, and readjustments and fluctuations in the 
exchane:;e rates of the currencies of, the developing countries in which it has 
headquarters shall be absorbed by the regular budget of the United Nations· 

• 
3. Decides further that the provisions of this resolution shall not 

apply to developed countries in wp.ich the United rrations has headquarters and 
which make voluntary contributions in order to offset the losses sustained by 
the United Nations as a result of inflation and monetary instability, 
provided that those contributions are in an amount at least equivalent to the 
amount \vhich would be payable by them as a result of their mm internal 
inflation and readjustments and fluctuations in the exchan~e rates of their 
currencies.
