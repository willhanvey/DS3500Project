 The Security Council, 

 Taking note of the letters to the President of the Council from the Secretary-
General dated 13 October 2010 (S/2010/513) and 23 November 2010 (S/2010/598), 
attaching letters from the President of the International Criminal Tribunal for 
Rwanda (“the International Tribunal”) dated 20 and 23 September 2010, and 
12 November 2010, respectively, 

 Recalling its resolutions 955 (1994) of 8 November 1994, 1165 (1998) of 
30 April 1998, 1329 (2000) of 30 November 2000, 1411 (2002) of 17 May 2002, 
1431 (2002) of 14 August 2002, 1717 (2006) of 13 October 2006, 1824 (2008) of

(2009) of 16 December 2009, and 1932 (2010) of 29 June 2010, 

 Recalling in particular its resolutions 1503 (2003) of 28 August 2003 and 1534 
(2004) of 26 March 2004, in which the Security Council called on the International 
Tribunal to take all possible measures to complete investigations by the end of 2004, 
to complete all trial activities at first instance by the end of 2008, and to complete 
all work in 2010, 

 Taking note of the assessment by the International Tribunal in its Completion 
Strategy Report (S/2010/574) that the Tribunal will not be in a position to complete 
all its work in 2010, 

 Noting that four permanent judges will be redeployed to the Appeals Chamber 
and that one permanent judge will leave the International Tribunal upon the 
completion of the cases to which they are assigned, 

 Convinced of the advisability of extending the authorization granted to the 
Secretary-General in resolution 1901 (2009) to appoint additional ad litem judges to 
the nine ad litem judges authorized by the Statute of the International Tribunal, as a 
temporary measure to enable the International Tribunal to complete trials and 
conduct additional trials as soon as possible in order to meet the goals of the 
Completion Strategy, 

 Urging the International Tribunal to take all possible measures to complete its 
work expeditiously, 

 Noting the concerns expressed by the President of the International Tribunal 
about the loss of experienced staff, and reaffirming that staff retention is essential 
for the timely completion of the International Tribunal’s work, 



S/2010/628

by 31 December 2011; 

 4. Reiterates the importance of the International Tribunal being adequately

time calls upon the International Tribunal to renew its efforts to focus on its core 
functions;
