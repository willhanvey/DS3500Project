 Reiterating its continuing support for the New Partnership for Africa’s 
Development9 as a development framework for Africa,  

 Recognizing that poverty is an affront to human dignity,  

 Recognizing also that extreme poverty and hunger are the greatest global threat 
that requires the collective commitment of the international community for its 
eradication, pursuant to Millennium Development Goal 1, and therefore calling 
upon the international community, including the Human Rights Council, to 
contribute towards achieving that goal,  

 Recognizing further that historical injustices have undeniably contributed to 
the poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion, economic 
disparity, instability and insecurity that affect many people in different parts of the 
world, in particular in developing countries,  

 Stressing that poverty eradication is one of the critical elements in the 
promotion and realization of the right to development and that poverty is a 
multifaceted problem that requires a multifaceted and integrated approach in 
addressing economic, political, social, environmental and institutional dimensions at 
all levels, especially in the context of the Millennium Development Goal of halving, 
by 2015, the proportion of the world’s people whose income is less than one dollar a 
day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger,  

 1. Endorses the conclusions and recommendations adopted by consensus by 
the Working Group on the Right to Development of the Human Rights Council at its 
eighth session,8 and calls for their immediate, full and effective implementation by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and other 
relevant actors;  

 2. Supports the realization of the mandate of the Working Group on the 
Right to Development as renewed for a period of two years by the Human Rights 
Council in its resolution 4/4, with the recognition that the Working Group shall 
convene annual sessions of five working days and present its reports to the Council;  

 3. Also supports the realization of the mandate of the high-level task force 
on the implementation of the right to development, established within the 
framework of the Working Group on the Right to Development, as renewed for a 
period of two years by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 4/4, with the 
further recognition that the task force will convene annual sessions of seven 
working days and present its reports to the Working Group on the Right to 
Development;  

 4. Emphasizes the relevant provisions of General Assembly resolution 
60/251 of 15 March 2006 establishing the Human Rights Council, and, in this 
regard, calls upon the Council:  

 (a) To promote and advance sustainable development and the achievement of 
the Millennium Development Goals;  

 (b) To agree on a programme of work that will lead to raising the right to 
development, as set out in paragraphs 5 and 10 of the Vienna Declaration and

Programme of Action,3 to the same level and on a par with all other human rights 
and fundamental freedoms;  

 5. Notes with appreciation that the high-level task force, at its second 
meeting, examined Millennium Development Goal 8, on developing a global 
partnership for development, and suggested criteria for its periodic evaluation with 
the aim of improving the effectiveness of global partnership with regard to the 
realization of the right to development;10 

 6. Stresses the importance of endorsement of the road map outlined in 
paragraphs 52 to 54 of the report of the Working Group on the Right to 
Development on its eighth session,8 which would ensure that the criteria for the 
periodic evaluation of global partnerships, as identified in Millennium Development 
Goal 8, prepared by the high-level task force and being progressively developed and 
refined by the Working Group, are extended to other components of Millennium 
Development Goal 8 by no later than 2009; 

 7. Also stresses that the above criteria, as endorsed by the Working Group, 
should be used, as appropriate, in the elaboration of a comprehensive and coherent 
set of standards for the implementation of the right to development;  

 8. Emphasizes the importance that, upon completion of the above phases, 
the Working Group take appropriate steps for ensuring respect for and practical 
application of these standards, which could take various forms, including guidelines 
on the implementation of the right to development, and evolve into a basis for 
consideration of an international legal standard of a binding nature, through a 
collaborative process of engagement;  

 9. Stresses the importance of the core principles contained in the 
conclusions of the Working Group at its third session,11 congruent with the purpose 
of international human rights instruments, such as equality, non-discrimination, 
accountability, participation and international cooperation, as critical to 
mainstreaming the right to development at the national and international levels, and 
underlines the importance of the principles of equity and transparency;  

 10. Also stresses that it is important that the high-level task force and the 
Working Group, in the discharge of their mandates, take into account the need:  

 (a) To promote the democratization of the system of international 
governance in order to increase the effective participation of developing countries in 
international decision-making; 

 (b) To also promote effective partnerships such as the New Partnership for 
Africa’s Development9 and other similar initiatives with the developing countries, 
particularly the least developed countries, for the purpose of the realization of their 
right to development, including the achievement of the Millennium Development 
Goals;  

 (c) To strive for greater acceptance, operationalization and realization of the 
right to development at the international level, while urging all States to undertake 
at the national level the necessary policy formulation and to institute the measures 
required for the implementation of the right to development as a fundamental human

right, and also urging all States to expand and deepen mutually beneficial 
cooperation in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development in 
the context of promoting effective international cooperation for the realization of the 
right to development, bearing in mind that lasting progress towards the 
implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies 
at the national level as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable 
economic environment at the international level;  

 (d) To consider ways and means to continue to ensure the operationalization 
of the right to development as a priority, including through further consideration of 
the elaboration of a convention on the right to development;  

 (e) To mainstream the right to development in the policies and operational 
activities of the United Nations and the specialized agencies, programmes and 
funds, as well as in policies and strategies of the international financial and 
multilateral trading system, taking into account in this regard that the core principles 
of the international economic, commercial and financial spheres, such as equity, 
non-discrimination, transparency, accountability, participation and international 
cooperation, including effective partnerships for development, are indispensable in 
achieving the right to development and preventing discriminatory treatment arising 
out of political or other non-economic considerations, in addressing the issues of 
concern to the developing countries;  

 11. Requests the Human Rights Council to ensure that its Advisory 
Committee pursues the ongoing work done by the Subcommission on the Promotion 
and Protection of Human Rights on the right to development, in accordance with the 
relevant provisions of General Assembly and Commission on Human Rights 
resolutions, and in compliance with decisions to be taken by the Human Rights 
Council, and requests the Secretary-General to report on progress in this regard to 
the Assembly at its sixty-third session;  

 12. Invites Member States and all other stakeholders to participate actively in 
future sessions of the Social Forum, while recognizing the strong support extended 
to the Forum at its previous four sessions by the Subcommission on the Promotion 
and Protection of Human Rights;  

 13. Reaffirms the commitment to implement the goals and targets set out in 
all the outcome documents of the major United Nations conferences and summits 
and their review processes, in particular those relating to the realization of the right 
to development, recognizing that the realization of the right to development is 
critical to achieving the objectives, goals and targets set in those outcome 
documents;  

 14. Also reaffirms that the realization of the right to development is essential 
to the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action,3 which 
regards all human rights as universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, 
places the human person at the centre of development and recognizes that, while 
development facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights, the lack of development 
may not be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally recognized human 
rights;  

 15. Stresses that the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection 
of all human rights lies with the State, and reaffirms that States have the primary 



A/C.3/62/L.49  
 

07-58094 6 
 

responsibility for their own economic and social development and that the role of 
national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized;  

 16. Reaffirms the primary responsibility of States to create national and 
international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to development, as 
well as their commitment to cooperate with each other to that end;  

 17. Also reaffirms the need for an international environment that is 
conducive to the realization of the right to development;  

 18. Stresses the need to strive for greater acceptance, operationalization and 
realization of the right to development at the international and national levels, and 
calls upon States to institute the measures required for the implementation of the 
right to development as a fundamental human right;  

 19. Emphasizes the critical importance of identifying and analysing obstacles 
impeding the full realization of the right to development at both the national and the 
international levels;  

 20. Affirms that, while globalization offers both opportunities and challenges, 
the process of globalization remains deficient in achieving the objectives of 
integrating all countries into a globalized world, and stresses the need for policies 
and measures at the national and global levels to respond to the challenges and 
opportunities of globalization if this process is to be made fully inclusive and 
equitable;  

 21. Recognizes that, despite continuous efforts on the part of the 
international community, the gap between developed and developing countries 
remains unacceptably wide, that developing countries continue to face difficulties in 
participating in the globalization process and that many risk being marginalized and 
effectively excluded from its benefits;  

 22. Underlines the fact that the international community is far from meeting 
the target set in the United Nations Millennium Declaration4 of halving the number 
of people living in poverty by 2015, reaffirms the commitment made to meet that 
target, and emphasizes the principle of international cooperation, including 
partnership and commitment, between developed and developing countries towards 
achieving the goal;  

 23. Urges developed countries that have not yet done so to make concrete 
efforts towards meeting the targets of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for 
official development assistance to developing countries and 0.15 to 0.2 per cent of 
their gross national product to least developed countries, and encourages developing 
countries to build on the progress achieved in ensuring that official development 
assistance is used effectively to help to meet development goals and targets;  

 24. Recognizes the need to address market access for developing countries, 
including in agriculture, services and non-agricultural products, in particular those 
of interest to developing countries;  

 25. Calls for the implementation of a desirable pace of meaningful trade 
liberalization, including in areas under negotiation; implementation of commitments 
on implementation-related issues and concerns; review of special and differential-
treatment provisions, with a view to strengthening them and making them more 
precise, effective and operational; avoidance of new forms of protectionism; and 



 A/C.3/62/L.49
 

7 07-58094 
 

capacity-building and technical assistance for developing countries as important 
issues in making progress towards the effective implementation of the right to 
development;  

 26. Recognizes the important link between the international economic, 
commercial and financial spheres and the realization of the right to development, 
stresses, in this regard, the need for good governance and broadening the base of 
decision-making at the international level on issues of development concern and the 
need to fill organizational gaps, as well as strengthen the United Nations system and 
other multilateral institutions, and also stresses the need to broaden and strengthen 
the participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition 
in international economic decision-making and norm-setting;  

 27. Also recognizes that good governance and the rule of law at the national 
level assist all States in the promotion and protection of human rights, including the 
right to development, and agrees on the value of the ongoing efforts being made by 
States to identify and strengthen good governance practices, including transparent, 
responsible, accountable and participatory government, that are responsive and 
appropriate to their needs and aspirations, including in the context of agreed 
partnership approaches to development, capacity-building and technical assistance;  

 28. Further recognizes the important role and the rights of women and the 
application of a gender perspective as a cross-cutting issue in the process of 
realizing the right to development, and notes in particular the positive relationship 
between women’s education and their equal participation in the civil, cultural, 
economic, political and social activities of the community and the promotion of the 
right to development;  

 29. Stresses the need for the integration of the rights of children, girls and 
boys alike, in all policies and programmes, and for ensuring the promotion and 
protection of those rights, especially in areas relating to health, education and the 
full development of their capacities;  

 30. Welcomes the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS adopted at the High-
level Meeting of the General Assembly on 2 June 2006,12 stresses that further and 
additional measures must be taken at the national and international levels to fight 
HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases, taking into account ongoing efforts 
and programmes, and reiterates the need for international assistance in this regard;  

 31. Takes note with appreciation of the adoption of the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities13 on 13 December 2006 and notes that this 
Convention is open for signature;

realization of the right to development, in particular in ensuring their rights in areas 
of education, employment, vocational training and retraining, housing, sanitation, 
health and social security recognized in human rights obligations and highlighted in 
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as adopted by 
the General Assembly in its resolution 61/295 of 13 September 2007;

development, as well as for corporate social responsibility;  

 34. Emphasizes the urgent need for taking concrete and effective measures to

detect and deter in a more effective manner international transfers of illicitly 
acquired assets and to strengthen international cooperation in asset recovery 
consistent with the principles of the United Nations Convention against 
Corruption,14 particularly chapter V thereof, stresses the importance of a genuine 
political commitment on the part of all Governments through a firm legal 
framework, and in this context urges States to sign and ratify as soon as possible, 
and States parties to implement effectively, the Convention;  

 35. Also emphasizes the need to strengthen further the activities of the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the promotion and 
realization of the right to development, including ensuring effective use of the 
financial and human resources necessary to fulfil its mandate, and calls upon the 
Secretary-General to provide the Office of the High Commissioner with the 
necessary resources;  

 36. Reaffirms the request to the High Commissioner, in mainstreaming the 
right to development, to undertake effectively activities aimed at strengthening the
