order to ascertain whether the East Timorese people accept the proposed
constitutional framework providing for a special autonomy for East Timor within
the unitary Republic of Indonesia or reject the proposed special autonomy for

with the General Agreement and to enable the Secretary-General to discharge his
responsibility under paragraph 3 of the Security Agreement;

end to such acts and the laying down of arms by all armed groups in East Timor,

which is a prerequisite for the holding of a free and fair ballot in East Timor;
