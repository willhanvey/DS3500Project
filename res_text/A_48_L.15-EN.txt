Aware of the importance attached by the countries of origin to the return
of cultural property which is of fundamental spiritual and cultural value to
them, so that they may constitute collections representative of their cultural
heritage,

Reaffirming the importance of inventories as an essential tool for the
understanding and protection of cultural property and for the identification of
dispersed heritage and as a contribution to the advancement of scientific and
artistic knowledge and intercultural communication,

Deeply concerned at the clandestine excavations and the illicit traffic in
cultural property that continue to impoverish the cultural heritage of all
peoples,

Again supporting the solemn appeal made on 7 June 1978 by the
Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization for the return of irreplaceable cultural heritage to those who
created it,

1. Commends the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization and the Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of
Cultural Property to Its Countries of Origin or Its Restitution in Case of
Illicit Appropriation on the work they have accomplished, in particular through
the promotion of bilateral negotiations, for the return or restitution of
cultural property, the preparation of inventories of movable cultural property,
the reduction of illicit traffic in cultural property and the dissemination of
information to the public;

2. Reaffirms that the restitution to a country of its objets d’art,
monuments, museum pieces, archives, manuscripts, documents and any other
cultural or artistic treasures contributes to the strengthening of international
cooperation and to the preservation and flowering of universal cultural values
through fruitful cooperation between developed and developing countries;

3. Recommends that Member States adopt or strengthen the necessary
protective legislation with regard to their own heritage and that of other
peoples;

4. Requests Member States to study the possibility of including in
permits for excavations a clause requiring archaeologists and palaeontologists
to provide the national authorities with photographic documentation of each
object brought to light during the excavations immediately after its discovery;

5. Invites Member States to continue drawing up, in cooperation with the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, systematic
inventories of cultural property existing in their territory and of their
cultural property abroad;

6. Also recommends that Member States should ensure that inventories of
museum collections include not only the items on display but also those in
storage, and that they comprise all necessary documentation, particularly
photographs of each item;

7. Also invites Member States engaged in seeking the recovery of cultural
and artistic treasures from the seabed, in accordance with international law, to
facilitate by mutually acceptable conditions the participation of States having
a historical and cultural link with those treasures;

8. Appeals to Member States to cooperate closely with the
Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to Its
Countries of Origin or Its Restitution in Case of Illicit Appropriation and to
conclude bilateral agreements for this purpose;

9. Also appeals to Member States to encourage the mass information media
and educational and cultural institutions to strive to arouse a greater and more
general awareness with regard to the return or restitution of cultural property
to its country of origin;

10. Requests States parties to the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting
and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural
Property to keep the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the
Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization fully informed of the measures taken to ensure implementation of
the Convention at the national level;

11. Requests the Secretary-General, in collaboration with the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, to continue to
explore all possibilities in order to bring about the attainment of the
afore-mentioned objectives;

12. Welcomes the steady increase in the number of States parties to the
Convention;

13. Invites once again those Member States that have not yet done so to
sign and ratify the Convention;

14. Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in cooperation
with the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization, to submit to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth
session a report on the implementation of the present resolution;

15. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fiftieth session
the item entitled "Return or restitution of cultural property to the countries
of origin".
