of 16 December 1993 concerning the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone
in South Asia,

Reiterating its conviction that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free
zones in various regions of the world is one of the measures that can contribute
effectively to the objectives of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and
general and complete disarmament,

Believing that the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South
Asia, as in other regions, will assist in the strengthening of the security of
the States of the region against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons,

Taking note with appreciation of the declarations issued at the highest
level by the Governments of South Asian States that are developing their
peaceful nuclear programmes, reaffirming their undertaking not to acquire or
manufacture nuclear weapons and to devote their nuclear programmes exclusively
to the economic and social advancement of their peoples,

Welcoming the recent proposal for the conclusion of a bilateral or regional
nuclear-test-ban agreement in South Asia,

Taking note of the proposal to convene, under the auspices of the United
Nations, a conference on nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia as soon as
possible, with the participation of the regional and other concerned States,

Taking note also of the proposal to hold consultations among five nations
with a view to ensuring nuclear non-proliferation in the region,

Considering that the eventual participation of other States, as
appropriate, in this process could be useful,
