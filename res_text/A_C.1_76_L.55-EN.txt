 Recognizing the inalienable right of all States to participate in the fullest 

possible exchange of equipment, materials and scientific and technological information  

for peaceful purposes, in accordance with relevant international obligations,  

 Reaffirming that preventing the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological 

weapons should not hamper international cooperation on materials, equipment and 

technology for peaceful purposes, while the goals of peaceful utilization should not 

be misused for proliferation purposes, 

 Bearing in mind the significant role of international cooperation on materials, 

equipment and technology for peaceful purposes in facilitating the economic and 

social development of Member States, in particular the development of developing 

countries, 

 Acknowledging the need to continue the exchange of technologies for peaceful 

uses, including in accordance with relevant international obligations,  

 Acknowledging also the importance of technology as one of the key means of 

implementation in the pursuit of sustainable development, 

 Noting with concern that undue restrictions on exports to developing countries 

of materials, equipment and technology for peaceful purposes persist,  

 Emphasizing that proliferation concerns are best addressed through multilaterally  

negotiated, universal, comprehensive and non-discriminatory agreements, 

 Emphasizing also that non-proliferation control arrangements should be 

transparent and open to participation by all States and should ensure that no 

restrictions are imposed on access to materials, equipment and technology for 

peaceful purposes required by developing countries for their continued sustainable 

development, 

 Emphasizing further the importance of promoting international cooperation for 

peaceful purposes, 

 1. Urges all Member States, without prejudice to their non-proliferation 

obligations, to take concrete measures to promote international cooperation on 

materials, equipment and technology for peaceful purposes, in particular not to 

maintain any restrictions incompatible with the obligations undertaken;  

 2. Requests the Secretary-General to seek the views and recommendations of 

all Member States on all aspects of promoting international cooperation on peaceful 

uses in the context of international security, including identifying undue restrictions 

on exports to developing countries of materials, equipment and technology for 

peaceful purposes, possible measures to achieve a balance between non-proliferation 

and peaceful uses, and the way forward;  

 3. Also requests the Secretary-General to submit a report containing the 

views and recommendations to the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session,
