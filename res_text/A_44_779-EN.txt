demonstrate the political will necessary to reach agreement on a common
approach and, in particular, on a common formula that could be included in an
international instrument of a legally binding charactert

4. Recommen- that further intensive effcrts should be devoted to the
search for such a common approach or common formula and that the various
alternative approaches, including, in particular, those considered in the
Conference on Disarmament, should be further explored in order to overcome the
