  United States of America: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council,  

 Recalling the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and 

bearing in mind its primary responsibility under the Charter for the maintenance of 

international peace and security,  

 Recalling its previous relevant resolutions and presidential statements 

addressing issues of peacekeeping,  

 Underscoring the importance of peacekeeping as one of the most effective tools 

available to the United Nations in the promotion and maintenance of international 

peace and security,  

 Reaffirming the basic principles of peacekeeping, such as consent of the parties, 

impartiality, and non-use of force, except in self-defence and defence of the mandate, 

and recognizing that the mandate of each peacekeeping operation is specific to the 

needs of the situation concerned and underlining that the mandates that it authorizes 

are consistent with the basic principles, and reiterating that the Security Council 

expects full delivery of the mandates it authorizes,  

 Commending the commitment of troop- and police-contributing countries and 

the sacrifices of uniformed and civilian personnel in implementing United Nations 

peacekeeping mandates in challenging environments, and reaffirming that the 

sustained commitment to operating in challenging environments is crucial for a 

peacekeeping mission’s success and full implementation of all peacekeeping 

mandates, 

 Expressing grave concern about the security threats and targeted attacks against 

United Nations peacekeepers in many peacekeeping missions that constitute a major 

challenge to United Nations peacekeeping operations, and condemns in the strongest 

terms killing of and all acts of violence against United Nations personnel, which may 

constitute war crimes,  

 Honouring the heroic work of tens of thousands of United Nations uniformed 

and civilian peacekeeping personnel, underscoring that the United Nations should not 

let the performance failures of a few tarnish the achievements of the whole,  

 Welcoming efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General to mobilize all partners 

and stakeholders in support of more effective United Nations peacekeeping through 

his initiative “Action for Peacekeeping”, to include advancing political solutions, 

strengthening protection of civilians, improving the safety and security of 

peacekeepers, supporting effective performance and accountability, strengthening the

impact of peacekeeping on sustaining peace, improving peacekeeping partnerships, 

and strengthening the conduct of peacekeeping operations and personnel,  

 Recalling the report on “Improving Security of United Nations Peacekeepers”, 

which highlights the link between the safety and security of peacekeepers and 

performance, and its plan of action, and recognizing that deficiencies in training, 

equipment and performance can increase risks to the safety and security of 

peacekeepers, including leading to increased risk of fatalities,  

 Underscoring the need to enhance the overall effectiveness and efficiency of 

United Nations peacekeeping through improved integrated mission planning, 

including threat assessments of violence against civilians and United Nations 

personnel, increasing the numbers and fulfilment of pledges of capabilities and 

enablers, and increasing overall mission performance,  

 Recognizing that realistic mandates and adequately resourced missions, 

deployed uniformed and civilian peacekeeping personnel that are willing, capable and 

equipped to effectively and safely implement their mandate, and strong leadership at 

all levels, including mission leadership, are essential to peacekeeping performance,  

 Stressing the importance of identifying gaps that have an impact on mandate 

delivery, improving provision of support services to field personnel, addressing 

systemic issues, and making recommendations on incorporation of lessons learned 

and best practices, in close cooperation with troop- and police-contributing countries 

and senior leadership, both in the field and at Headquarters,  

 Underscoring the link between performance and safety and security of 

uniformed and civilian peacekeeping personnel and recognizing that institutionalizing 

a culture of performance in UN peacekeeping will contribute to better delivery of 

peacekeeping mandates, as well as lead to improvements in the safety and security of 

peacekeepers,  

 Acknowledging the importance of data to inform objective decision-making to 

improve the performance of UN peacekeeping, taking into account the unique 

conditions of individual missions, and recalling resolutions 2378 (2017) and 2382 

(2017) and their request of the Secretary-General to ensure that data related to the 

effectiveness of peacekeeping operations, including peacekeeping performance data, 

is used to improve analytics and the evaluation of mission operations, based on clear 

and well identified benchmarks for mandate implementation and emphasizing the 

need to regularly review all peacekeeping operations, and welcoming the work 

already initiated by the Secretariat in the setting up of a comprehensive and integrated 

performance policy framework measuring performance based on data collection and 

analysis,  

 Recalling the importance of the role of UN peacekeeping operations in 

protecting civilians, where mandated, and expressing strong concern regarding 

continued instances of underperformance, including, inter alia, inaction in the face 

of, in particular, imminent threats of physical violence against civilians, insufficient 

contingency planning to react to violence, conduct and discipline issues, risk averse 

leadership, lax force protection standards, inadequate operational readiness and 

preparedness, and inadequate integrated planning, and also noting with concern 

instances in which national caveats may have a detrimental effect on mandate 

implementation and performance,  

 Encouraging further coordination between the United Nations and regional and 

subregional organizations on strengthening peacekeeping performance,

 Welcoming the contribution of peacekeeping operations to a comprehensive 

strategy for sustaining peace, and noting with appreciation the contributions that 

peacekeepers and peacekeeping missions make to peacebuilding,  

 Expressing deep concern about the serious and continuous allegations and 

underreporting of sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations peacekeepers and 

non-United Nations forces authorized under a Security Council mandate, including 

military, civilian and police personnel, and underscoring that sexual exploit ation and 

abuse, among other crimes and forms of serious misconduct, by any such personnel 

is unacceptable, and commending the troop- and police-contributing countries that 

have taken steps to prevent, investigate and hold accountable their personnel for a cts 

of sexual exploitation and abuse,
