 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 49/75 K of 15 December 1994, 51/45 M of  
10 December 1996, 52/38 O of 9 December 1997, 53/77 W of 4 December 1998,

of 3 December 2004, 60/76 of 8 December 2005 and 61/83 of 6 December 2006, 

 Convinced that the continuing existence of nuclear weapons poses a threat to 
all humanity and that their use would have catastrophic consequences for all life on 
Earth, and recognizing that the only defence against a nuclear catastrophe is the 
total elimination of nuclear weapons and the certainty that they will never be 
produced again, 

 Reaffirming the commitment of the international community to the goal of the 
total elimination of nuclear weapons and the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free 
world, 

 Mindful of the solemn obligations of States parties, undertaken in article VI of 
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,1 particularly to pursue

negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear 
arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, 

 Recalling the principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and 
disarmament adopted at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to 
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,2 

 Emphasizing the unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon States to 
accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear 
disarmament, adopted at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on 
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,3 

 Recalling the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in its 
resolution 50/245 of 10 September 1996, and expressing its satisfaction at the 
increasing number of States that have signed and ratified the Treaty, 

 Recognizing with satisfaction that the Antarctic Treaty4 and the treaties of 
Tlatelolco,5 Rarotonga,6 Bangkok,7 Pelindaba8 and Semipalatinsk,9 as well as 
Mongolia’s nuclear-weapon-free status, are gradually freeing the entire southern 
hemisphere and adjacent areas covered by those treaties from nuclear weapons, 

 Stressing the importance of strengthening all existing nuclear-related 
disarmament and arms control and reduction measures, 

 Recognizing the need for a multilaterally negotiated and legally binding 
instrument to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the threat or use of nuclear 
weapons, 

 Reaffirming the central role of the Conference on Disarmament as the sole 
multilateral disarmament negotiating forum, and regretting the lack of progress in 
disarmament negotiations, particularly nuclear disarmament, in the Conference 
during its 2007 session, 

 Emphasizing the need for the Conference on Disarmament to commence 
negotiations on a phased programme for the complete elimination of nuclear 
weapons with a specified framework of time, 

 Expressing its regret over the failure of the 2005 Review Conference of the 
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to reach 
agreement on any substantive issues, 

 Expressing its deep concern at the lack of progress in the implementation of 
the thirteen steps to implement article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
