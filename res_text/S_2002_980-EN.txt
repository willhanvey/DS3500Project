Further reaffirming its unwavering support for the peace process and its

Ethiopia to follow through on its pledge relating to the release and repatriation of its
POWs and civilian internees, and calling upon both parties to continue to clarify the
cases of any remaining POWs and to resolve all other remaining issues in
accordance with the Geneva Conventions, in cooperation with the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC),

Expressing concern regarding reported incidents of cross border harassment
and abductions of civilians on both sides, referred to in the report of the Secretary-
