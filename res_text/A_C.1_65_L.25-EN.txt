Nuclear Weapons,1 and the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference of the 
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,2 

 Recalling in particular the unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon 
States to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals, leading to

 Recognizing the continued vital importance of the early entry into force of the 
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty4 to the advancement of nuclear 
disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation objectives, and welcoming the recent 
ratification of the Treaty by the Marshall Islands, the Central African Republic and 
Trinidad and Tobago, 

 Recalling that the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, in its final document,2 inter alia, reaffirmed 
the conviction that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones enhances global 
and regional peace and security, strengthens the nuclear non-proliferation regime 
and contributes towards realizing the objectives of nuclear disarmament, 

 Recognizing that the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on 
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, in its final document, encouraged the 
establishment of further nuclear-weapon-free zones, and expressing the hope that 
this encouragement will be followed by concerted international efforts to create 
nuclear-weapon-free zones in areas in the world where they do not currently exist, 
especially in the Middle East, 

 Noting with satisfaction the agreement at the 2010 Review Conference of the 
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons on practical steps 
to fully implement the 1995 resolution on the Middle East, 

 Welcoming the holding in New York on 30 April 2010 of the second 
Conference of States Parties and Signatories to Treaties that Establish Nuclear-
Weapon-Free Zones and Mongolia, and taking note of its Outcome Document,5 

 Welcoming also the conclusion and signature of the Treaty on Measures for the 
Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, and the commitment 
by its signatories, the Russian Federation and the United States of America, to seek 
its early entry into force and full implementation, while noting the encouragement 
of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons to both States to continue discussions on follow-on measures in 
order to achieve deeper reductions in their nuclear arsenals, and stressing the need 
for all nuclear-weapon States to take effective nuclear disarmament measures which 
comply with the fundamental principles of transparency, verification and irreversibility, 

 Welcoming further the agreement between the Russian Federation and the 
United States of America concerning the management and disposition of plutonium 
designated as no longer required for defence purposes and their commitment to 
conclude legally binding agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency 
to implement verification measures, 

 Recalling that the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons reaffirmed and recognized that the total 
elimination of nuclear weapons is the only absolute guarantee against the use or 
threat of use of nuclear weapons and the legitimate interest of non-nuclear-weapon 
States in receiving unequivocal and legally binding security assurances from 
nuclear-weapon States,
