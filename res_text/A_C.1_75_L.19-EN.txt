A/C.1/75/L.19 
 

 

20-13094 2/3 

 

among the nations of the world and should be exercised multilaterally and that, as the 

most universal and most representative organization in the world, the United Nations 

must play the central role, 

 Convinced that, in the globalization era and with the information revolution, 

arms regulation, non-proliferation and disarmament problems are more than ever the 

concern of all countries in the world, which are affected in one way or another by 

these problems and therefore should have the possibility to participate in the 

negotiations that arise to tackle them, 

 Bearing in mind the existence of a broad structure of disarmament and arms 

regulation agreements resulting from non-discriminatory and transparent multilateral 

negotiations with the participation of a large number of countries, regardless of their 

size and power, 

 Aware of the need to advance further in the field of arms regulation, 

non-proliferation and disarmament on the basis of universal, multilateral, 

non-discriminatory and transparent negotiations with the goal of reaching general and 

complete disarmament under strict international control,  

 Recognizing the complementarity of bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral 

negotiations on disarmament, 

 Recognizing also that the proliferation and development of weapons of mass 

destruction, including nuclear weapons, are among the most immediate threats to 

international peace and security which need to be dealt with, with the highest priority, 

 Considering that the multilateral disarmament agreements provide the 

mechanism for States parties to consult one another and to cooperate in solving any 

problems which may arise in relation to the objective of, or in the application of, the 

provisions of the agreements and that such consultations and cooperation may also be 

undertaken through appropriate international procedures within the framework of the 

United Nations and in accordance with the Charter,  

 Stressing that international cooperation, the peaceful settlement of disputes, 

dialogue and confidence-building measures would make an essential contribution to 

the creation of multilateral and bilateral friendly relations among peoples and nations,  

 Being gravely concerned at the continuous and progressive erosion of 

multilateralism in the field of arms regulation, non-proliferation and disarmament, 

and recognizing that the abrogation of major instruments of the arms control and 

non-proliferation architecture as a result of unilateral actions by Member States in 

resolving their security concerns would jeopardize international peace and security 

and undermine confidence in the international security system as well as the 

foundations of the United Nations itself, 

 Noting that the Eighteenth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the 

Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Baku on 25 and 26 October 2019, 

welcomed the adoption of resolution 73/41 on the promotion of multilateralism in the 

area of disarmament and non-proliferation and underlined the fact that multilateralism 

and multilaterally agreed solutions, in accordance with the Charter, provide the only 

sustainable method of addressing disarmament and international security issues, 

 Reaffirming the absolute validity of multilateral diplomacy in the field of 

disarmament and non-proliferation, and determined to promote multilateralism as an 

essential way to develop arms regulation and disarmament negotiations,  

 1. Reaffirms multilateralism as the core principle in negotiations in the area 

of disarmament and non-proliferation with a view to maintaining and strengthening 

universal norms and enlarging their scope; 

https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/73/41


 
A/C.1/75/L.19 

 

3/3 20-13094 

 

 2. Also reaffirms multilateralism as the core principle in resolving 

disarmament and non-proliferation concerns; 

 3. Urges the participation of all interested States in multilateral negotiations 

on arms regulation, non-proliferation and disarmament in a non-discriminatory and 

transparent manner; 

 4. Underlines the importance of preserving the existing agreements on arms 

regulation and disarmament and the multilateral disarmament forums, which 

constitute an expression of the results of international cooperation and multilateral 

negotiations in response to the challenges facing humankind;  

 5. Calls once again upon all Member States to renew and fulfil their 

individual and collective commitments to multilateral cooperation as an important 

means of pursuing and achieving their common objectives in the area of disarmament 

and non-proliferation; 

 6. Requests the States parties to the relevant instruments on weapons of mass 

destruction to consult and cooperate among themselves in resolving their concerns 

with regard to cases of non-compliance as well as on implementation, in accordance 

with the procedures defined in those instruments, and to refrain from resorting or 

threatening to resort to unilateral actions or directing unverified non-compliance 

accusations against one another to resolve their concerns;  

 7. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General containing the replies of 

Member States on the promotion of multilateralism in the area of disarmament and 

non-proliferation, submitted pursuant to resolution 74/55;2 

 8. Requests the Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States on the 

issue of the promotion of multilateralism in the area of disarmament and 

non-proliferation and to submit a report thereon to the General Assembly at its 

seventy-sixth session; 

 9. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-sixth session, 

under the item entitled “General and complete disarmament”, the sub-item entitled 

“Promotion of multilateralism in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation”.
