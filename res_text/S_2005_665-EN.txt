Noting that the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to
constitute a threat to international peace and security in the region,

Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,

1. Decides to extend the mandate of MONUC until 30 September 2006;

2. Having taken note of the recommendations described in paragraphs 27 to
29 of the report of the Secretary-General, authorizes an increase of 300 personnel in
the military strength of MONUC to allow for the deployment of an infantry
battalion in Katanga, with enabling assets including its own air mobility and
appropriate medical support, to provide additional security within its area of
operations during the electoral period;

3. Underlines the temporary character of the increase referred to in the
previous paragraph, and requests the Secretary-General to take the necessary steps

made for that purpose;

4. Calls on the Transitional institutions and on all Congolese parties to
ensure that free, fair and peaceful elections take place, and that the timetable for
polls developed by the Independent Electoral Commission is scrupulously respected,
and underlines in this regard that it is the responsibility of the Congolese authorities
to adopt the necessary legislation without further delay;

5. Calls on the Government of National Unity and Transition to carry out
reform of the security sector, through the expeditious integration of the Armed
Forces and of the National Police of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in
particular by ensuring adequate payment and logistical support for their personnel;

6. Calls on the donor community, as a matter of urgency, to continue to
engage firmly in the provision of assistance needed for the integration, training and
equipping of the Armed Forces and of the National Police of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, and urges the Government of National Unity and Transition
to promote all possible means to facilitate and expedite cooperation to this end;

7. Requests MONUC, within its capacity and mandate, and in consultation
with international financial institutions and donors, to continue to provide advice
and assistance as well as the necessary support, to the effective follow-up to the
meeting on 21 September 2005 between the Espace présidentiel and the
International Committee in Support of the Transition, to strengthen support for good
governance and transparent economic management;

instances of sexual exploitation and abuse and its efforts to put in place preventive
measures, requests the Secretary-General to continue to take the necessary measures
to achieve actual compliance in MONUC with the United Nations zero-tolerance
policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and to keep the Council informed, and urges

cases of such conduct involving their personnel;
