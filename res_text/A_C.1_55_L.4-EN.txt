Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: the need for a new agenda

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolutions 53/77 Y of 4 December 1998 and 54/54 G of 1
December 1999,

Expressing its deep concern at the continued risk for humanity represented by
the possibility that nuclear weapons could be used,

Concerned that negotiations on nuclear arms reductions are currently stalled,

Recalling the International Court of Justice advisory opinion entitled “Legality
of the threat or use of nuclear weapons”, issued at The Hague on 8 July 1996,1

Concerned at the continued retention of the nuclear weapons option by those
three States that operate unsafeguarded nuclear facilities and that have not acceded
to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and concerned at their
failure to renounce that option,

Declaring that nuclear test explosions carried out in 1998 by two of the States
that have not renounced the nuclear weapons option do not in any way confer a
nuclear-weapon State status or any special status whatsoever,

Noting that despite achievements in bilateral and unilateral arms reductions,
the total number of nuclear weapons deployed and in stockpile still amount to many
thousands,

Welcoming the significant progress achieved in nuclear weapons reductions
made unilaterally or bilaterally under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START)
process, as steps towards nuclear disarmament,

Welcoming the ratification of the Treaty on Further Reduction and Limitation
of Strategic Offensive Arms (START II)2 by the Russian Federation as an important
step in the efforts to reduce strategic offensive weapons, and stressing that
completion of ratification of START II by the United States of America remains a
priority,

Welcoming the significant unilateral reduction measures taken by other
nuclear-weapon States, including the close-down and dismantling of nuclear
weapon-related facilities,

Welcoming the efforts of several States to cooperate in making nuclear
disarmament measures irreversible, in particular, through initiatives on the
verification, management and disposition of fissile material declared excess to
military purposes,

Noting the nuclear-weapon States’ declaration that none of their nuclear
weapons are targeted at any State,

Underlining the necessity of strict compliance by all parties with their
obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,3

Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration,4 in which the heads of
State and Government resolved to strive for the elimination of weapons of mass
destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, and to keep all options open for achieving
this aim, including the possibility of convening an international conference to
identify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers,

Welcoming the Final Document of the Sixth Review Conference of the Parties
to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and underlining the need
for urgent action to achieve a world free from nuclear weapons,

Underlining the fundamental significance of the unequivocal undertaking by
the nuclear-weapon States to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear
arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament, to which all States parties to the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty are committed under article VI of the Treaty,

Determined to pursue practical steps for the systematic and progressive efforts
to implement article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
and paragraphs 3 and 4 (c) of the 1995 decision entitled “Principles and objectives
for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament”,

1. Agrees on the importance and urgency of signatures and ratifications,
without delay and without conditions and in accordance with constitutional

Ban Treaty;5

2. Calls for the upholding of a moratorium on nuclear-weapon-test
explosions or any other nuclear explosions pending entry into force of that Treaty;

3. Agrees on the necessity of negotiations in the Conference on
Disarmament on a non-discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and
effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear
weapons or other nuclear explosive devices in accordance with the statement of the
Special Coordinator in 1995 and the mandate contained therein, taking into
consideration both nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation objectives.
The Conference on Disarmament is urged to agree on a programme of work which
includes the immediate commencement of negotiations on such a treaty with a view
to their conclusion within five years;

4. Agrees on the necessity of establishing in the Conference on
Disarmament an appropriate subsidiary body with a mandate to deal with nuclear
disarmament. The Conference on Disarmament is urged to agree on a programme of
work which includes the immediate establishment of such a body;

5. Calls for the principle of irreversibility to apply to nuclear disarmament,
nuclear and other related arms control and reduction measures;

6. Calls for the early entry into force and full implementation of START II2

disarmament in a way that promotes international stability, and based on the
principle of undiminished security for all, for:

(a) Further efforts by the nuclear-weapon States to reduce their nuclear
arsenals unilaterally;

(b) Increased transparency by the nuclear-weapon States with regard to the
nuclear weapons capabilities and the implementation of agreements pursuant to
article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons3 and as a
voluntary confidence-building measure to support further progress on nuclear
disarmament;

(c) The further reduction of non-strategic nuclear weapons, based on
unilateral initiatives and as an integral part of the nuclear arms reduction and
disarmament process;

(e) A diminishing role for nuclear weapons in security policies to minimize
the risk that these weapons will ever be used and to facilitate the process of their
total elimination;

(f) The engagement as soon as appropriate of all the nuclear-weapon States
in the process leading to the total elimination of their nuclear weapons;

9. Calls for arrangements by all nuclear-weapon States to place, as soon as
practicable, fissile material designated by each of them as no longer required for
military purposes under the International Atomic Energy Agency or other relevant
international verification and arrangements for the disposition of such materials for
peaceful purposes, to ensure that such material remains permanently outside military
programmes;

10. Reaffirms that the ultimate objective of the efforts of States in the
disarmament process is general and complete disarmament under effective
international control;

11. Calls for regular reports, within the framework of the strengthened
review process for the Non-Proliferation Treaty, by all States parties on the
implementation of article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and paragraph 4 (c) of
the 1995 decision entitled “Principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation
and disarmament”, and recalling the advisory opinion of the International Court of
Justice of 8 July 1996;1

12. Agrees to pursue the further development of the verification capabilities
that will be required to provide assurance of compliance with nuclear disarmament
agreements for the achievement and maintenance of a nuclear-weapon-free world;

13. Calls on all States not yet party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons to accede to the Treaty as non-nuclear-weapon States, promptly
and without condition, particularly those States that operate unsafeguarded nuclear
facilities, and calls upon those States to bring into force the required comprehensive
safeguards agreements, together with additional protocols consistent with the Model
Protocol Additional to the Agreement(s) between State(s) and the International
Atomic Energy Agency for the Application of Safeguards7 for ensuring nuclear non-
proliferation, and to reverse clearly and urgently any policies to pursue any nuclear-
weapon development or deployment and to refrain from any action which could
undermine regional and international peace and security and the efforts of the
international community towards nuclear disarmament and the prevention of nuclear
weapons proliferation;

14. Calls upon those States that have not yet done so to conclude full-scope
safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency and to
conclude additional protocols to their safeguards agreement on the basis of the
Model Protocol approved by the Board of Governors of the Agency on 15 May
1997;

15. Notes the paramount importance of effective physical protection of all

16. Notes that the Sixth Review Conference of the States parties to the Non-
Proliferation Treaty called upon its Preparatory Committee to make
recommendations to the 2005 Review Conference on legally binding security
assurances by the five nuclear-weapon States to the non-nuclear-weapon States
parties to the Treaty;

17. Reaffirms the conviction that the establishment of internationally
recognized nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at
among the States of the region concerned enhances global and regional peace and
security, strengthens the nuclear non-proliferation regime and contributes towards
realizing the objective of nuclear disarmament, and supports proposals for the
establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones where they do not yet exist, such as in
the Middle East and South Asia;

18. Affirms that a nuclear-weapon-free world will ultimately require the
underpinnings of a universal and multilaterally negotiated legally binding
instrument or a framework encompassing a mutually reinforcing set of instruments;

19. Acknowledges the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation
of General Assembly resolution 54/54 G,8 and requests him, within existing
resources, to compile a report on the implementation of the present resolution;
