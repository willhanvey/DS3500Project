  Draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions and statements by its President on the 
situation in Liberia and West Africa, 

 Welcoming the sustained progress made by the Government of Liberia since 
January 2006, in rebuilding Liberia for the benefit of all Liberians, with the support 
of the international community, 

 Recalling its decision not to renew the measures in paragraph 10 of resolution 
1521 (2003) regarding round log and timber products originating in Liberia, and 
stressing that Liberia’s progress in the timber sector must continue with the effective 
implementation and enforcement of the National Forestry Reform Law signed into 
law on 5 October 2006, including the resolution of land and tenure rights, 

 Applauding the Government of Liberia’s recent admission as a participant in 
the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, 

 Anticipating the Kimberley Process report to the Council, through the 
Committee established pursuant to resolution 1521 (2003), as encouraged in 
paragraph 2 of resolution 1753 (2007), 

 Stressing the continuing importance of the United Nations Mission in Liberia 
(UNMIL) in improving security through Liberia and helping the new Government 
establish its authority throughout the country, particularly in the diamond and 
timber-producing regions, and border areas, 

 Taking note of the report of the United Nations Panel of Experts on Liberia 
dated 24 May 2007 (S/2007/340, annex), 

 Having reviewed the measures imposed by paragraphs 2 and 4 of resolution 
1521 (2003) and paragraph 1 of resolution 1532 (2004) and the progress towards 
meeting the conditions set out by paragraph 5 of resolution 1521 (2003), and 
concluding that insufficient progress has been made towards that end, 

 Underlining its determination to support the Government of Liberia in its 
efforts to meet those conditions, and encouraging donors to do likewise, 

 Determining that, despite significant progress having been made in Liberia, the 
situation there continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security in 
the region, 



S/2007/369

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 

 1. Requests the Secretary-General to establish, within one month from the 
date of adoption of this resolution, in consultation with the Committee, for a period 
of six months, a Panel of Experts consisting of up to three members, with the range 
of expertise necessary to fulfil the Panel’s mandate described in this paragraph, 
drawing as much as possible on the expertise of the members of the Panel of Experts 
reappointed pursuant to resolution 1731 (2006), to undertake the following tasks: 

 (a) To conduct a follow-up assessment mission to Liberia and neighbouring 
States, in order to investigate and compile a report on the implementation, and any 
violations, of the measures imposed by resolution 1521 (2003), including any 
information relevant to the designation by the Committee of the individuals 
described in paragraph 4 (a) of resolution 1521 (2003) and paragraph 1 of resolution 
1532 (2004), and including the various sources of financing, such as from natural 
resources, for the illicit trade of arms; 

 (b) To assess the impact of and effectiveness of the measures imposed by 
paragraph 1 of resolution 1532 (2004), including particularly with respect to the 
assets of former President Charles Taylor; 

 (c) To assess the implementation of forestry legislation passed by the 
Liberian Congress on 19 September 2006 and signed into law by President Johnson 
Sirleaf on 5 October 2006, recalling that resolution 1689 (2006) decided not to 
renew the measure in paragraph 10 of resolution 1521 (2003) that obligated Member 
States to prevent the import into their territories of all round log and timber products 
originating in Liberia; 

 (d) To assess the Government of Liberia’s compliance with the Kimberley 
Process Certification Scheme, recalling that resolution 1753 (2007) decided to 
terminate the measures on diamonds imposed by paragraph 6 of resolution 1521 
(2003) and renewed by paragraph 1 of resolution 1731 (2006); 

 (e) To report to the Council through the Committee by 6 December 2007 on 
all the issues listed in this paragraph, and to provide informal updates to the 
Committee as appropriate before that date; 

 (f) To cooperate with other relevant groups of experts, in particular that 
established on Côte d’Ivoire by resolution 1708 (2006) of 14 September 2006; 

 (g) To identify and make recommendations regarding areas where the 
capacity of States in the region can be strengthened to facilitate the implementation 
of the measures imposed by paragraph 4 of resolution 1521 (2003) and paragraph 1 
of resolution 1532 (2004); 

 2. Calls upon all States and the Government of Liberia to cooperate fully 
with the Panel of Experts in all the aspects of its mandate; 

 3. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
