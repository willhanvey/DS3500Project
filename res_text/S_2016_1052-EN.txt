draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming its resolutions 1540 (2004) of 28 April 2004, 1673 (2006) of 

27 April 2006, 1810 (2008) of 25 April 2008, 1977 (2011) of 20 April 2011, and 

2055 (2012) of 29 June 2012, 

 Reaffirming that the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, 

as well as their means of delivery, constitutes a threat to international peace and 

security, 

 Reaffirming its decision that none of the obligations in resolution 1540 (2004) 

shall be interpreted so as to conflict with or alter the rights and obligations of State 

Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Chemical 

Weapons Convention and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention or alter the 

responsibilities of the International Atomic Energy Agency or the Organization for 

the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, 

 Remaining gravely concerned by the threat of terrorism and the risk that 

non-State actors may acquire, develop, traffic in or use nuclear, chemical, and 

biological weapons and their means of delivery, including by using the rapid 

advances in science, technology and international commerce to that end,  

 Reaffirming that prevention of proliferation of nuclear, chemical and 

biological weapons should not hamper international cooperation in materials, 

equipment and technology for peaceful purposes while goals of peaceful utilization 

should not be misused for proliferation purposes,

 Stressing the need to strengthen national measures of export control of 

materials related to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their means of 

delivery, consistent with resolution 1540 (2004), 

 Further noting that the full implementation of resolution 1540 (2004) by all

delivery,  

 Stressing the importance of dialogue between the 1540 Committee and 

Member States, including visits to States at their invitation, and also recogni zing 

that such a dialogue has contributed to facilitating implementation of resolution 

1540 (2004), inter alia by raising awareness about the importance of presenting 

national reports and the utility of voluntary national implementation action plans 

and has helped to identify assistance needs of States, 

 Recognizing that many States continue to require assistance in implementing 

resolution 1540 (2004), and emphasizing the importance of providing States, in 

response to their requests, with effective assistance that meets their needs,  

 Stressing the need to reinforce the role of the 1540 Committee in providing 

and facilitating effective assistance, including, inter alia, in the field of State 

capacity-building, and collaboration among States, between the 1540 Committee 

and States, and between the 1540 Committee and relevant international, regional 

and subregional organizations in assisting States to implement resolution 1540
