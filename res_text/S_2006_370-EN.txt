  Draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions and statements by its president on the 
situation in Liberia and West Africa, 

 Welcoming the leadership of newly elected President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and 
her efforts to restore peace, security and harmony throughout Liberia, 

 Underscoring the continuing need for the United Nations Mission in Liberia 
(UNMIL) to support the Government of Liberia in building a stable environment 
that will allow democracy to flourish, 

 Recognizing the need for newly vetted and trained Liberian security forces to 
assume greater responsibility for national security, including policing, intelligence 
gathering, and executive protection, 

 Determining that, despite significant progress having been made in Liberia, the 
situation there continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security in 
the region, 

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 

 1. Decides that the measures imposed by paragraph 2 (a) and (b) of 
resolution 1521 (2003) shall not apply to the weapons and ammunition already 
provided to members of the Special Security Service (SSS) for training purposes 
pursuant to advance approval under paragraph 2 (e) by the Committee established 
by paragraph 21 of that resolution and that those weapons and ammunition may 
remain in the custody of the SSS for unencumbered operational use; 

 2. Further decides that the measures imposed by paragraph 2 (a) and (b) of 
resolution 1521 (2003) shall not apply to limited supplies of weapons and 
ammunition, as approved in advance on a case-by-case basis by the Committee, 
intended for use by members of the Government of Liberia police and security 
forces who have been vetted and trained since the inception of the United Nations 
Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) in October 2003; 

 3. Decides that a request made in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be 
submitted to the Committee by the Government of Liberia and the exporting State, 
and, in case of approval, the Government of Liberia shall subsequently mark the 
weapons and ammunition, maintain a registry of them, and formally notify the 
Committee that these steps have been taken; 



S/2006/370  
 

2 06-38510 
 

 4. Reiterates the importance of UNMIL’s continuing assistance to the 
Government of Liberia, the Committee established by paragraph 21 of resolution 
1521 (2003) and the Panel of Experts, within its capabilities and areas of 
deployment, and without prejudice to its mandate, including in monitoring the 
implementation of the measures in paragraphs 2, 4, 6 and 10 of resolution 1521 
(2003), and in this regard requests UNMIL to inspect inventories of weapons and 
ammunition obtained in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 above to ensure all 
such weapons and ammunition are accounted for, and to make periodic reports to 
the Committee established by paragraph 21 of resolution 1521 (2003) on its 
findings; 

 5. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
