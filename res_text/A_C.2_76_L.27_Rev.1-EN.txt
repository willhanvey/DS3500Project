 Recognizing the need to ensure that the benefits of trade are more widely shared,  

 Reaffirming World Trade Organization decision WT/MIN(15)/48-WT/L/982 of 

19 December 2015 on the implementation of preferential treatment in favour of 

services and service suppliers of the least developed countries and increasing their 

participation in services trade and decision WT/L/508/Add.1 of 25 July 2012 on 

accession by the least developed countries, encouraging progress on the 

implementation of the World Trade Organization work programme on small 

economies, which supports their efforts towards sustainable development, as also 

reflected in the outcome document of the third International Conference on Small 

Island Developing States, the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) 

Pathway, 1  and stressing that Aid for Trade and targeted trade-related capacity-

building are essential to integrating developing countries, in particular the least 

developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing 

States, into the international trading system,  

 Recognizing the critical role of women as producers and traders and the need to 

address their specific challenges in order to facilitate their equal and active 

participation in domestic, regional and international trade,  

 Recognizing also that multilateral rules and disciplines are the best guarantee 

against protectionism and are fundamental to the transparency, predictability and 

stability of international trade,  

 Noting the commitments to working to ensure that bilateral, regional and 

plurilateral trade agreements complement the multilateral trading system, recognizing 

that they can play an important role in complementing global liberalization initiatives, 

and in this regard recalling the entry into force of the Agreement Establishing the 

African Continental Free Trade Area, on 30 May 2019,  

 Noting with great concern the severe negative impact on human health, safety 

and well-being caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as 

the severe disruption to societies and economies and the devastating impact on lives 

and livelihoods, and that the poorest and most vulnerable are the hardest hit by the 

pandemic, reaffirming the ambition to get back on track to achieve the Sus tainable 

Development Goals by designing and implementing sustainable and inclusive 

recovery strategies to accelerate progress towards the full implementation of the 2030 

Agenda for Sustainable Development and to help to reduce the risk of and build 

resilience to future shocks, crises and pandemics, including by strengthening health 

systems and achieving universal health coverage, and recognizing that equitable and 

timely access for all to safe, quality, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccines, 

therapeutics and diagnostics are an essential part of a global response based on unity, 

solidarity, renewed multilateral cooperation and the principle of leaving no one 

behind, 

 Deeply concerned that the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted trade, transport, 

tourism, cross-border travel, commodity markets, investment, debt service and 

financial flows, including remittances, with significant impacts on traditionally 

underrepresented groups and the operation of global value chains, affecting all sectors 

of the economy, including micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises and people’s 

lives, especially in developing and least developed countries, compounding the 

challenges posed by climate change, which have had a devastating impact on 

sustainable development and humanitarian needs, including on poverty eradication, 

on the reduction of inequalities, including gender inequality, and on livelihoods, 

ending hunger, food security and nutrition, education, environmentally sound waste 

management and access to health care, especially for the poorest and the most

vulnerable, particularly in developing countries, including countries in special 

situations, as well as countries facing specific challenges and those most affected by

affected by insufficient progress in multilateral trade negotiations and that it is 

imperative for the World Trade Organization to address issues that are at the heart of

strengthen the World Trade Organization, with a view to ensuring the continued 

viability and effectiveness of its dispute settlement, negotiating and monitoring 

functions;

but not exclusively, developing countries;  

 10. Calls upon all members of the World Trade Organization to urgently
