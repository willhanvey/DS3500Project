 and 17 August 2015,

 Strongly condemning the grave deterioration of the human rights situation in the 

Syrian Arab Republic, the indiscriminate killing and deliberate targeting of civilians 

as such, including those involving the continued indiscriminate use of heavy weapons  

and aerial bombardments, which has caused more than 400,000 fatalities, including 

the killing of more than 17,000 children, the continued widespread and systematic 

gross violations, as well as abuses, of human rights and violations of international 

humanitarian law, including by the starvation of civilians as a method of warfare 

and the use of chemical weapons, including chlorine gas, sarin and sulphur mustard, 

which are prohibited under international humanitarian law, and acts of violence that 

foment sectarian tensions by the Syrian authorities against the Syrian population,  

 Noting with deep concern the culture of impunity for serious violations of 

international law and violations and abuses of human rights law committed during the  

present conflict, which has provided a fertile ground for further violations and abuses,   

 Recalling that, amid expressions of popular discontent over restrictions on the 

enjoyment of civil, political, economic and social rights, civilian protests erupted in 

Dar’a in March 2011, and noting that the violent oppression of civilian protests by 

the Syrian authorities, which later escalated to the direct shelling of civilians, 

fuelled the escalation of armed violence and violent extremist groups, and terrorist 

groups, including so-called ISIL (also known as Da’esh),

 Recalling also the specific obligations under international humanitarian law to 

respect and protect, in situations of armed conflict, medical personnel and 

humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means of 

transport and equipment, and hospitals and other medical facilities, and to ensure 

that the wounded and sick receive, to the fullest extent practicable and with the least 

possible delay, the medical care and attention required, recalling also that, under 

international law, attacks intentionally directed against hospitals and places where 

the sick and wounded are collected, provided that they are not military objectives, 

as well as attacks intentionally directed against buildings, material, medical units 

and transport and personnel using the distinctive emblems of the Geneva 

Conventions of 12 August 1949
28

 in conformity with international law are war 

crimes, and recalling the applicable rules of international humanitarian law relating 

to the non-punishment of any person for carrying out medical activities compatible 

with medical ethics,  

 Expressing grave concern at the disproportionate use of force by the Syrian 

authorities against civilians, which has caused immense human suffering and 

fomented the spread of extremism and extremist groups and which demonstrates the 

failure of the Syrian authorities to protect its population and to implement the 

relevant resolutions and decisions of United Nations bodies,   

 Expressing grave concern also at the remaining presence of extremism and 

violent extremist groups, terrorism and terrorist groups, and strongly condemning 

all violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian  

law committed in the Syrian Arab Republic by any party to the conflict, in particular 

so-called ISIL (also known as Da’esh), Al-Nusrah Front, Al-Qaida-affiliated terrorist 

groups, and militias fighting on behalf of the regime, and other violent extremist 

groups,  

 Expressing its deepest concern about the latest findings of the Organization for 

the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative 

Mechanism that the Syrian Arab Armed Forces were responsible for the use of sarin 

as a chemical weapon in Khan Shaykhun in April 2017,  and that so-called ISIL (also 

known as Da’esh) used sulfur mustard in Umm Hawsh in September 2016, as well 

as previous findings of at least three chlorine attacks by the Syrian Arab Republic 

and one mustard attack by so-called ISIL (also known as Da’esh), reaffirming the 

principles of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Productio n, 

Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction,
29

 and the 

determination of the States parties to the Convention “for the sake of all mankind, to 

exclude completely the possibility of the use of chemical weapons, through the 

implementation of the provisions of this Convention”, and noting that the 

Convention entered into force in the Syrian Arab Republic on 14 October 2013,   

 Expressing support for the work carried out by the Independent International 

Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, and strongly condemning the 

lack of cooperation by the Syrian authorities with the Commission of Inquiry,   

 Noting with serious concern the observation of the Commission of Inquiry 

that, since March 2011, the Syrian authorities have conducted widespread attacks 

against the civilian population as a matter of policy,   

 Noting with serious concern also the observation of the Commission of 

Inquiry that non-State armed groups still resort to the use of force against civilians,

 Strongly condemning the reported killing of detainees in Syrian military 

intelligence facilities and the widespread practice of enforced disappearance, arbitrary  

detention and the use of sexual and gender-based violence and torture in detention 

centres referred to in the reports of the Commission of Inquiry, including, but not 

limited to, Branch 215, Branch 227, Branch 235, Branch 251, the Air Force 

Intelligence Investigation Branch at Mezzeh military airport and Sednaya prison, 

including the reported practice of mass hangings by the authorities, as well as the 

reported killing of detainees at military hospitals, including Tishreen and Harasta 

hospitals,  

 Recalling the statements made by the Secretary-General, the United Nations 

High Commissioner for Human Rights and the special procedures of the Human 

Rights Council that crimes against humanity and war crimes are likely to have been 

committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, noting the repeated encouragement by the 

High Commissioner for the Security Council to refer the situation  to the 

International Criminal Court, and regretting that a draft resolution
30

 was not adopted 

notwithstanding broad support from Member States,   

 Expressing its deepest concern about the findings of the Commission of Inquiry 

and also the allegations contained in the evidence presented by “Caesar” in January 

2014 regarding the torture and execution of persons incarcerated by the Syrian 

authorities, and underscoring the need for those allegations and similar evidence to 

be collected, examined and made available for future accountability efforts,  

 Expressing concern that the implementation of Security Council resolutions 

2139 (2014), 2165 (2014), 2191 (2014), 2254 (2015) of 18 December 2015, 2258 

(2015), 2268 (2016) and 2286 (2016) remains largely unfulfilled, and noting the 

urgent need to strengthen efforts to address the humanitarian situation in the Syrian 

Arab Republic, including through protection of civilians and full, immediate, 

unimpeded and sustained humanitarian access,  

 Recalling its commitment to Security Council resolutions 2170 (2014), 2178 

(2014), and 2253 (2015) of 17 December 2015,  

 Alarmed that more than 5.3 million refugees, including more than 3.8 million 

women and children, have been forced to flee the Syrian Arab Republic and that 

13.6 million people in the Syrian Arab Republic, of whom 6.5 million are internally 

displaced, require urgent humanitarian assistance, which has resulted in an influx of 

Syrian refugees into neighbouring countries, other countries in the region and beyond,  

and alarmed at the risk the situation presents to regional and international stability,   

 Expressing its profound indignation at the death of more than 17,000 children 

and the many more injured since the beginning of the peaceful protests in March 

2011, and at all grave violations and abuses committed against children in 

contravention of applicable international law, such as their recruitment and use, 

killing and maiming, rape, kidnapping and abductions and attacks on schools and 

hospitals, as well as their arbitrary arrest, detention, torture, ill -treatment and their 

use as human shields,  

 Expressing its deep appreciation for the significant efforts that have been 

made by neighbouring countries and other countries in the region to accommodate 

Syrians, while acknowledging the increasing financial, socioeconomic and political 

impact of the presence of large-scale refugee and displaced populations in those 

countries, notably in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, Egypt and Libya,   

 Underscoring the critical need to build conditions for the safe and voluntary 

return of refugees and internally displaced persons to their home areas and the

Member States, especially the members of the International Syria Support Group, to 

use their influence to ensure respect for those commitments and the full 

implementation of those resolutions, to support efforts to create conditions for a 

durable and lasting ceasefire, which is essential to achieving a political solution to 

the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, and to bring to an end the systematic, 

widespread and gross violations and abuses of human rights and violations of 

international humanitarian law,  

 1. Strongly condemns the systematic, widespread and gross violations and 

abuses of international human rights law and violations of international 

humanitarian law committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, and the indiscriminate 

and disproportionate attacks in civilian areas and against civilian infrastructure, in 

particular attacks on medical facilities and schools, which continue to claim civilian 

lives, and demands that all parties comply with their obligations under international 

humanitarian law;  

 2. Deplores and condemns in the strongest terms the continued armed 

violence by the Syrian authorities against its own people since the beginning of the

any event to minimize, incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage 

to civilian objects and meet their responsibilities to protect the Syrian population
