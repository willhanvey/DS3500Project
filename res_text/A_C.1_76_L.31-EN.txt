 Recognizing the crucial role of conventional arms control in promoting regional 

and international peace and security,  

 Recognizing also the importance of equitable representation of women in arms 

control discussions and negotiations,  

 Convinced that conventional arms control needs to be pursued primarily in the 

regional and subregional contexts since most threats to peace and security in the 

post-cold-war era arise mainly among States located in the same region or subregion,  

 Aware that the preservation of a balance in the defence capabilities of States at 

the lowest level of armaments would contribute to peace and stability and should be

 Desirous of promoting agreements to strengthen regional peace and security at 

the lowest possible level of armaments and military forces,  

 Noting with particular interest the initiatives taken in this regard in different 

regions of the world, in particular the commencement of consultations among a

number of Latin American countries and the proposals for conventional arms control 

made in the context of South Asia, and recognizing, in the context of this subject, the 

relevance and value of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, 1 which 

is a cornerstone of European security,  

 Believing that militarily significant States and States with larger military 

capabilities have a special responsibility in promoting such agreements for regional 

security, 

 Believing also that an important objective of conventional arms control in 

regions of tension should be to prevent the possibility of military attack launched by 

surprise and to avoid aggression,  

 1. Decides to give urgent consideration to the issues involved in conventional 

arms control at the regional and subregional levels;  

 2. Requests the Conference on Disarmament to consider the formulation of 

principles that can serve as a framework for regional agreements on conventional 

arms control, and looks forward to a report of the Conference on this subject;  

 3. Requests the Secretary-General, in the meantime, to seek the views of 

Member States on the subject and to submit a report to the General Assembly at its 

seventy-seventh session; 

 4. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-seventh 

session, under the item entitled “General and complete disarmament”, the sub-item 

entitled “Conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels”.
