 Reaffirming also that, by virtue of the principle of self-determination, all 
peoples have the right freely to determine their political status and to pursue their 
economic, social and cultural development, and that every State has the duty to 
respect this right in accordance with the provisions of the Charter, 

 Reaffirming further the Declaration on Principles of International Law 
concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the 
Charter of the United Nations,4  

 Concerned at the low level of ratification of and accession to the International 
Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries,5 
and considering the possible future use of a model law to facilitate the accession of 
the States that wish to become parties to the Convention, 

 Alarmed and concerned at the danger that the activities of mercenaries 
constitute to peace and security in developing countries, in particular in Africa and 
in small States,

 Extremely alarmed and concerned about recent mercenary activities in Africa 
and other places and the threat they pose to the integrity of and respect for the 
constitutional order of those countries, 

 Concerned by the new modalities of mercenarism and the fact that the 
recruitment of former military personnel and ex-policemen by private military and 
private security companies to serve in their employ as “security guards” in zones of 
armed conflict seems to be continuing, 

 Convinced that, notwithstanding the way in which they are used or the form 
that they take to acquire some semblance of legitimacy, mercenaries or mercenary-
related activities are a threat to peace, security and the self-determination of peoples 
and an obstacle to the enjoyment of all human rights by peoples,

as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of 
peoples to self-determination;6

training are causes for grave concern to all States and violate the purposes and 
principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations;

operations by third Powers, inter alia, encourage the demand for mercenaries on the 
global market; 

 4. Urges once again all States to take the necessary steps and to exercise 
the utmost vigilance against the menace posed by the activities of mercenaries and 
to take legislative measures to ensure that their territories and other territories under 
their control, as well as their nationals, are not used for the recruitment, assembly,

financing, training and transit of mercenaries for the planning of activities designed 
to impede the right of peoples to self-determination, to destabilize or overthrow the

conflicts or actions to destabilize constitutional regimes; 

 6. Encourages States that import the military assistance, consultancy and

necessary action to accede to or ratify the International Convention against the

of those countries and the exercise of the right of their peoples to self-
determination; 

 10. Calls upon States to investigate the possibility of mercenary involvement 
whenever and wherever criminal acts of a terrorist nature occur and to bring to trial 
those found responsible or to consider their extradition, if so requested, in 
accordance with domestic law and applicable bilateral or international treaties; 

 11. Condemns any form of impunity granted to perpetrators of mercenary 
activities and to those responsible for the use, recruitment, financing and training of 
mercenaries, and urges all States, in accordance with their obligations under 
international law, to bring them, without distinction, to justice; 

 12. Calls upon Member States, in accordance with their obligations under 
international law, to cooperate with and assist the judicial prosecution of those 
accused of mercenary activities in transparent, open and fair trials; 

 13. Requests the Working Group to continue the work already done by the 
previous Special Rapporteurs on the strengthening of the international legal 
framework for the prevention and sanction of the recruitment, use, financing and 
training of mercenaries, taking into account the proposal for a new legal definition 
of a mercenary drafted by the Special Rapporteur in his report to the Commission on 
Human Rights at its sixtieth session;7

and security companies on the enjoyment of human rights, and requests the Office 
of the High Commissioner to convene other regional governmental consultations on 
this matter; 

 16. Requests the Working Group to continue to take into account, in the 
discharge of its mandate, the fact that mercenary activities continue to occur in 
many parts of the world and are taking on new forms, manifestations and modalities,

mercenary-related activities, in order to meet the demands of its current and future 
activities;
