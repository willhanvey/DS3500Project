Commending the untiring efforts and bravery of the United Nations
Protection Force in securing relief operations in the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, as well as the efforts of the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees and other relief and humanitarian agencies, and
expressing its condemnation of the recent attacks on the United Nations
Protection Force in Sarajevo by Serbian forces resulting in loss of life and
injuries to some of its personnel, .

Taking note of the report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on
Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the territory of the former
Yugoslavia dated 6 November 1992, 1/ in which he stated, inter alia, that
"ethnic cleansing" did not appear to be the consequence of the war, but rather
its goal,

Taking note also of the report of the Special Rapporteur dated
17 November 1992, 1/ in which he stated, inter alia, that another factor which
had contributed to the intensity of "ethnic cleansing" in areas under Serbian
control was the marked imbalance between the weaponry in the hands of the
Serbian and the Muslim population of Bosnia and Herzegovina,

Gravely concerned about the deterioration of the situation in the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina owing to intensified acts of aggression by
the Serbian and Montenegrin forces to acquire more territories by force,
characterized by a consistent pattern of gross and systematic violations of
human rights, a burgeoning refugee population resulting from mass expulsions
of defenceless civilians from their homes and the existence in Serbian and
Montene~';tn controlled areas of concentration camps and detention centres, in
pursuit .: the abhorrent policy of "ethnic cleansing", which is a form of
genocide,

Strongly condemning Serbia and Montenegro and their surrogates in the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina for their continued non-compliance with all
relevant United Nations resolutions, .

Deeply regretting that the sanctions imposed by the Security Council have
not had tne desired effect of halting the acts of aggression by Serbian and
Montenegrin irregular forces and the direct and indirect support of the
Yugoslav People's 'Army for the acts of aggression" in the Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina,

Recalling that the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
has accepted the constitutional principles proposed by the Co-Chairman of the
Internatio'nal Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, "
