stressing the urgent need for efforts to reverse the negative trends on the ground and 

to restore a political horizon for advancing and accelerating meaningful negotiations

without exception, leading to a peaceful, just, lasting and comprehensive solution to

pre-1967 borders and the just resolution of all final status issues and to mobilize 

international support for and assistance to the Palestinian people, and in this regard 

authorizes the Committee to make such adjustments in its approved programme of 

work as it may consider appropriate and necessary in the light of developments and
