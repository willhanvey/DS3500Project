Verification and Monitoring Mechanism (JBVMM), in accordance with Council 

resolution 2046 and the AUPSC road map of 24 April 2012, as a result of South 

Sudan’s continued disagreement with the location of the SDBZ centreline and its 

decision of 22 November 2013 to temporarily suspend its participation in the 

JBVMM,  

 Underlining the importance of establishing and maintaining effective JBVMM 

monitoring of the SDBZ, including the “14 Mile Area”,

choose the path of dialogue instead of resorting to violence or provocations,  

 Welcoming the importance of recent meetings of President Bashir and 

President Salva Kiir in continuing dialogue, recalling the UNSC decision in 

resolution 2046 that the parties must resume immediately negotiations to reach

 Expressing its determination that the future status of Abyei shall be resolved 

by negotiations between the parties in a manner consistent with the CPA and not by 

the unilateral actions of either party,

Abyei Area, due to continued delays in the establishment of the Abyei Area

issues related to nomadic migration, which are essential to maintain law and order

agencies’ Sudanese staff from returning to Abyei,  

 Noting that the continued delay in establishing the temporary institutions and 

resolving the final status of Abyei contributes to tension in the regio n, emphasizing 

the importance of all parties refraining from any unilateral action to aggravate 

intercommunal relations within Abyei Area, and expressing concern over the 

continued implications of what the AUPSC described in their 6 November 2013 

press statement as “the decision by the Ngok Dinka to conduct a unilateral 

referendum”,  

 Bearing in mind the importance of coherence of United Nations assistance in 

the region,

keep the Council fully updated on the status of deployment as part of his regular

source of such violence;

exclusive and official use of UNISFA;  

 17. Renews its call upon Sudan and South Sudan to provide full support to 

the United Nations, including by promptly issuing visas to military, police and
