The Security Council,

Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 22 March 1999 (S/1999/307)

POLISARIO Front,

1. Decides to extend the mandate of the United Nations Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) until 30 April 1999 to allow for an
understanding to be reached among all concerned on detailed modalities for the
implementation of the identification and appeals protocols, including a revised
implementation schedule, in a manner that would preserve the integrity of the
Secretary-General’s package of measures;

2. Requests both parties to move ahead with the necessary discussions to
reach an agreement on the refugee repatriation protocol, so that all aspects of
the work needed to prepare the way for the repatriation of refugees may begin,

the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Tindouf;
