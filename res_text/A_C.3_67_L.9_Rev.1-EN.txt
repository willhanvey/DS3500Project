revised draft resolution 
 
 

  Towards a comprehensive and integral international legal instrument

 The General Assembly, 

 Reaffirming the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations 
and the obligations contained in the relevant human rights instruments,  

 Reaffirming also that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 proclaims 
that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, and that 
everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein, without distinction 
of any kind, such as age, race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other 
opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status,  

 Recalling all General Assembly resolutions on matters relating to older 
persons, including older women, beginning with resolution 2542 (XXIV) of 
11 December 1969, and recalling also all relevant resolutions of the Economic and 
Social Council, the Commission for Social Development and the Commission on the 
Status of Women on the promotion and protection of the rights and dignity of older 
persons,

A/C.3/67/L.9/Rev.1

 Reaffirming the outcomes of the World Assembly on Ageing, held in Vienna, in 
1982,2 the United Nations Principles for Older Persons of 1991,3 the global targets 
on ageing for the year 2001, as agreed in 1992,4 and the Proclamation on Ageing of 
1992,5 as well as the outcomes of the Second World Assembly on Ageing, held in 
Madrid, in 20026 and the respective follow-up reviews, in particular as they pertain 
to the promotion of the rights and well-being of older persons on an equal and 
participatory basis,  

 Recognizing that different efforts made to increase cooperation and integration 
and increasing awareness and sensitivity to ageing issues since the adoption of the 
Madrid International Plan of Action7 by Governments, relevant bodies of the United 
Nations system and civil society, including non-governmental organizations and the 
private sector, have not been sufficient to promote full and effective participation by 
and opportunities for older persons in economic, social, cultural and political life,  

 Recalling its resolution 65/182 of 21 December 2010, in which it decided to 
establish an open-ended working group, open to all States Members of the United 
Nations, for the purpose of strengthening the protection of the human rights of older 
persons by considering the existing international framework of the human rights of 
older persons and identifying possible gaps and how best to address them, including 
by considering, as appropriate, the feasibility of further instruments and measures,  

 Recalling also its resolution 66/127, in which it designated 15 June as World 
Elder Abuse Awareness Day, and invited States and relevant bodies and 
organizations of the United Nations system, including relevant human rights 
mandate holders and treaty bodies and the regional commissions, as well as 
intergovernmental and relevant civil society organizations, including 
non-governmental organizations and the private sector, with an interest in the 
matter, to continue to contribute to highlighting the urgent need to eliminate all 
forms of abuse and violence against older persons,  

 Recognizing that, by 2050, more than 20 per cent of the world’s population 
will be 60 years old or older, and recognizing also that the increase in the number of 
older persons will be greatest and most rapid in the developing world, 

 Recognizing also the essential contribution that older men and women can 
continue to make to the functioning of society if adequate guarantees, means and 
resources, as well as the highest possible level of health care, are in place, and that 
older persons must be full participants in the development process and also share its 
benefits,  

 Reaffirming the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and 
summits and their respective follow-up reviews, in particular as they pertain to the 
promotion of the human rights and the well-being of older persons on an equal and 
participatory basis,

 Encouraged by the increasing interest of the international community in the 
promotion and protection of the rights and dignity of older persons in the world 
under a comprehensive and integral approach,  

 Acknowledging that there are numerous obligations vis-à-vis older persons 
implicit in most core human rights treaties but that explicit references to age in core 
international human rights treaties are scarce, that there is no such instrument for 
older persons, and that only a few instruments contain explicit references to age,  

 Welcoming the reports of the Open-ended Working Group on Ageing and the 
report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the human 
rights situation of older persons,8 which include recommendations towards a 
convention to remedy the existing gaps regarding older persons in the current 
mechanisms and instruments, 

 1. Decides that the Open-ended Working Group on Ageing shall, as part of 
its mandate and starting from its upcoming fourth session, to be held in 2013, 
consider proposals for an international legal instrument to promote and protect the 
rights and dignity of older persons, based on the holistic approach in the work done 
in the fields of social development, human rights and non-discrimination, as well as 
gender equality and the empowerment of women, and taking into account the inputs 
of the Human Rights Council, the reports of the Open-ended Working Group on 
Ageing and the recommendations of the Commission for Social Development and 
the Commission on the Status of Women, as well as the contributions from the 
second global review and appraisal of the Madrid International Plan of Action on 
Ageing, to be held during the fifty-first session of the Commission for Social 
Development; 

 2. Requests the Open-ended Working Group on Ageing to present to the 
General Assembly at the earliest possible date a proposal containing, inter alia, the 
main elements that an international legal instrument to promote and protect the 
rights and dignity of older persons should include, which are not currently addressed 
sufficiently by existing mechanisms and therefore require further international 
protection; 

 3. Invites States, relevant bodies and organizations of the United Nations 
system, including relevant human rights treaty bodies and the regional commissions, 
as well as civil society, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations with 
an interest in the matter to make contributions to the work entrusted to the Open-
ended Working Group on Ageing, as set out in paragraph 1 above, based on the 
practice of the General Assembly;  

 4. Requests the Secretary-General, with the support of the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Division for Social 
Policy and Development of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the 
Secretariat and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the 
Empowerment of Women, to submit to the Open-ended Working Group on Ageing 
by its fourth session and within existing resources a compilation of existing 
international legal instruments, documents and programmes which directly or 
indirectly address the situation of older persons, including, inter alia, those of

conferences, summits, meetings or international or regional seminars convened by 
the United Nations and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations;  

 5. Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Open-ended Working 
Group on Ageing with the facilities necessary for the performance of the work 
entrusted to it in the present resolution;  

 6. Also requests the Secretary-General to include in the report to the 
General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session under the sub-item entitled “Follow-up 
to the International Year of Older Persons: Second World Assembly on Ageing” 
comprehensive information on the implementation of this resolution.
