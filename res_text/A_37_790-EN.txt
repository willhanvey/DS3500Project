I. INTRODUCTION 

1. At its 4th plenary meeting, on 24 September 1982, the General Assembly decided 
to include in the agenda of its thirty-seventh session the item entitled "Programme 
budget for the biennium 1982-1983" and to allocate it to the Fifth Committee. 

2. The Fifth Committee considered the item at its 3rd, 14th, 19th to 22nd, 28th, 
30th, 34th, 39th, 41st, 42nd, 45th to 47th, 49th, 50th, 52nd to 54th, 56th, 57th, 
59th to 62nd, and 64th to 77th meetings, on 29 September, 18, 26 to 29 October, 8, 
10, 15, 19, 22, 23, 29 and 30 November, 1 to 4, 6, 8 to 20 December 1982. 

3. The comments and observations made in the course of the discussion of this 
item are reflected in the relevant summary records (A/C.S/37/SR.3, 14, 19-22, 28, 
30, 34, 39, 41, 42, 45-47, 49, 50, 52-54, 56, 57, 59-62 and 64-77). 

4. Section II of the present report contains a summary of the recommendations of 
the Fifth Committee during the current session on the revised estimates submitted 
by the Secretary-General as well as on the financial implications of resolutions 
adopted by the General Assembly either on the recommendation of its Main Committees 
or in respect of items dealt with in plenary meetings. 

5. Section III of the report provides a summary of the special subjects 
considered by the Fifth Committee, other than the administrative and financial 
implications of draft resolutions, which led to the adoption of specific decisions 
(other than appropriations) to be recommended to the General Assembly. 

6. The recommendations of the Fifth Committee are contained in section IV of the 
present report. 

II. PROORAMME BUDGET FOR THE BIENNIUM 1982-1983 

7. By its resolutions 36/240 A and B of 18 December 1981, the General Assembly 
approved appropriations for the biennium 1982-1983 in the amount of $1,506,241,800 
and estimates of income in the amount of $284,553,000. 

8. Recommendations of the Fifth Committee during the current session of the 
General Assembly on revised estimates submitted by the Secretary-General, as well 
as on the financial implications of resolutions adopted by the Assembly under items 
considered by other Main Committees, have resulted in net reductions in the 
approved level of appropriations in the amount of $33,280,100 and net reductions in 
the approved estimates of income in the amount of $27,493,100. The relevant
