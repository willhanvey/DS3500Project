implementation of the Completion Strategy of the International Tribunal,  

 Noting that permanent judge Sergei Aleckseevich Egorov (Russian Federation) 
intends to resign from the International Tribunal, 

 Convinced of the need to enlarge the membership of the Appeals Chamber in

 Stressing the need to ensure that none of the Appeals Chamber judges is 
assigned to any case to which he or she was assigned at the pre-trial or trial stage,

 Urging the International Tribunal to take all possible measures to complete its 
work expeditiously,

does not give rise to conflicts of interest and does not delay the delivery of the 
judgment;
