 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 71/31 and 71/32 of 5 December 2016, 71/90 of 

6 December 2016, 72/250 of 24 December 2017, 73/6 of 26 October 2018, 73/91 of 

7 December 2018 and 74/34 of 12 December 2019 and its decisions 73/512 of 

5 December 2018 and 75/514 of 7 December 2020, as well as its other resolutions and 

decisions on this subject, 

 Expressing grave alarm over the threat of an arms race in outer space, which 

would impair the prospects for limiting and reducing armaments in general and erect 

insurmountable barriers to international cooperation in the peaceful exploration  of 

outer space, 

 Recognizing the catastrophic consequences of an arms race in outer space, which 

should be used exclusively for peaceful and creative purposes, or any military 

conflicts in outer space and that the prevention of an arms race in outer space  would 

avert a grave danger for international peace and security,  

 Emphasizing the importance of article IV of the Treaty on Principles Governing 

the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon 

and Other Celestial Bodies,1 

 Bearing in mind that all States, in particular those with major space capabilities, 

should contribute actively to the prevention of an arms race in outer space with a view 

to promoting and strengthening international cooperation in the exploration and use

of outer space for peaceful purposes, with the objective of shaping a community of 

shared future for humankind, 

 Recognizing that, while the existing international treaties related to outer space 

and the legal regime provided for therein play a positive role in regulating outer space 

activities, they are unable to fully prevent an arms race in outer space, the placement 

of weapons in outer space and the threat or use of force in outer space, from space 

against Earth and from Earth against objects in outer space, and preserve outer space 

for peaceful purposes, and that there is a need to consolidate and reinforce this regime,  

 Expressing serious concern over the plans declared by certain States that include 

placement of weapons, in particular strike combat systems, in outer space, the threat 

or use of force in outer space, from space against Earth and from Earth against objects 

in outer space and the use of outer space for combat operations,  

 Convinced that further measures should be examined in the search for effective 

and verifiable bilateral and multilateral agreements in order to prevent an arms race 

in outer space and preserve outer space for peaceful purposes,  

 Welcoming, in this regard, the draft treaty on the prevention of the placement of 

weapons in outer space and of the threat or use of force against outer space objects, 

introduced by China and the Russian Federation at the Conference on Disarmament 

in 2008,2 and the submission of its updated version in 2014, 3 

 Stressing the importance of the political statements made by a number of States 4 

that they would not be the first to place weapons in outer space,  

 Recognizing the primary role and responsibility of the Conference on 

Disarmament in the negotiation of a multilateral agreement or agreements on the 

prevention of an arms race in outer space,  

 Taking into account the work done by the Group of Governmental Experts on 

Further Practical Measures for the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space in 2018 

and 2019 in the search for further practical measures for the prevention of an arms 

race in outer space, in particular in the course of future negotiations at the Conference 

on Disarmament on the international legally binding instrument in this regard,  

 1. Proclaims it a historic responsibility of all States to ensure that the 

exploration of outer space is carried out exclusively for peaceful purposes for the 

benefit of mankind; 

 2. Declares that the exclusion of outer space from the sphere of the arms race 

and the preservation of outer space for peaceful purposes should become a mandatory 

norm of State policy and a generally recognized international obligation;  

 3. Calls upon all States, and above all those with major space capabilities, to 

this end: 

 (a) To take urgent measures to prevent for all time the placement of weapons 

in outer space and the threat or use of force in outer space, from space against Earth 

and from Earth against objects in outer space;

3/3 21-14843 

 

 (b) To seek through negotiations the early elaboration of appropriate reliably 

verifiable legally binding multilateral agreements;  

 4. Expresses its deep regret over the years of stalemate in the work of the 

Conference on Disarmament, and looks forward to the Conference again fulfilling its 

mandate as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum; 

 5. Urges the Conference on Disarmament to agree on and implement at its 

earliest opportunity a balanced and comprehensive programme of work that includes 

the immediate commencement of negotiations on an international legally binding 

instrument on the prevention of an arms race in outer space, including on the 

prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space and of the threat or use of 

force in outer space, from space against Earth and from Earth against objects in outer 

space; 

 6. Acknowledges that the guaranteed prevention of an arms race in outer 

space will provide an opportunity for the peaceful exploration of outer space and its 

use in solving acute major problems relating to economic, social and cultural 

development facing mankind today, as well as in consolidating the efforts of States 

of the world in this domain; 

 7. Requests the Secretary-General, within existing resources, to seek the 

views and proposals of Member States on the provision of guarantees for the 

prevention of an arms race in outer space and preserving outer space for peaceful 

purposes, and to submit a substantive report, with an annex containing those views, 

to the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session, for further discussion by 

Member States; 

 8. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-seventh 

session, under the item entitled “Prevention of an arms race in outer space”, the 

sub-item entitled “Further practical measures for the prevention of an arms race in 

outer space”.
