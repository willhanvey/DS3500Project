The General Asse[!]cly,

BecallrrE its resolutions 2286 (xxII) of 5 Decenber 1967, 3262 (xxlx) of
9 Decenber L974, 3473 (xxx) of 1l December L9'75,32/76 of 12 Decenber 1977,
s-IO/2 of 30 June \978, 33/58 of 14 Decenber :-978, 34/7I of 11 December 1979'
35/L43 of 12 Decenber 1980, 36183 of 9 December L98I. 37/71 of 9 December 1982
and 38/6I of 15 Decernber 1983 corcernirg the signature and ratificalion of
Additional Protocol I of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in
Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco), I/

Takinq into account that vrithin the zone of application of chat Treaty,
to which tr^'enty-three sovere iqn slates are already parties, there are some
territories which, in spite of not being sovereign political entities, are
nevertheless in a position to receive the benefits deriving fron the Treaty
through its Mditional Protocol I, to which the four States that de jure or
de facto are intelnationally responsible for those territories rnay become
parties,

Becallinq that three of those States - the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the United
States of Arnerica - became parties to Additional Protocol I in 1959' 1971
and 198I, respect ively,

1. Deplofes that the signature of Additional Protocol I by France,
which took place on 2 March 1979p has not yet been followed by the
correspolrdir€ ratification, notwithstandirg the time already elapsed and the
pressing invitations which the ceneral Assenbly has addressed to itt

2. Onc e- more- urqes I'rance not to delay any further such ratificationt
which has been requested so nany tines and which appears all the nore
ad\risable, sirce Franc€ is the oh]-y one of che four States to trhich the
Protocol is open that is not yet party to itt

3. Psctdes to include in the provisional agenda of its fortieth session
an iten entitled nlnplementation of General Assembly resolution 39/...
corcerning the signature and ratification of Mditional Protocol I of the
Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear lleapons in Latin Anerica (Treaty of
Tlatelolco) " .
