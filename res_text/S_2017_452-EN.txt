  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 

  draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council,  

 Recalling all its previous resolutions and statements of its President 

concerning the situation in Somalia, in particular resolutions 2245 (2015) and 2297 

(2016), 

 Noting that the joint assessment mission of the African Union Mission in 

Somalia (AMISOM) requested in paragraph 24 of resolution 2297 (2016) to ensure 

that AMISOM is properly configured to support the next phase of state-building in 

Somalia, and requested to present options and recommendations to the Security 

Council, has been delayed, 

 Looking forward to the report of the joint assessment by 15 July 2017, 

recognizing the importance of adequate time to consider the recommendations of the 

report and in this regard, also recognizing the need for an extension to the 

authorization of AMISOM, 

 Determining that the situation in Somalia continues to constitute a threat to 

international peace and security in the region,  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 1. Decides to authorize the Member States of the African Union to maintain 

the deployment of AMISOM until 31 August 2017, in line with the Security 

Council’s request to the African Union for a maximum level of 22,126 uniformed 

personnel, and authorizes AMISOM to take all necessary measures to carry out its 

mandate, as set out in paragraphs 4-7 of resolution 2297 (2016); 

 2. Requests the Secretary-General to continue to provide logistical support 

as set out in paragraph 2 of resolution 2245 (2015); 

 3. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
