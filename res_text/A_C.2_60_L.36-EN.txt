The General Assembly,

Recalling the relevant principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations,

Reaffirming the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning
Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of
the United Nations,1 which states, inter alia, that no State may use or encourage the
use of unilateral economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another
State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign
rights,

Bearing in mind the general principles governing the international trading
system and trade policies for development contained in relevant resolutions, rules
and provisions of the United Nations and the World Trade Organization,

Recalling its resolutions 44/215 of 22 December 1989, 46/210 of 20 December

Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures
adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries in
particular and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation
and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open
multilateral trading system,
