the following draft resolutions: 

 

 

  Draft resolution I 

  Unilateral economic measures as a means of political and 

economic coercion against developing countries 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling the relevant principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, 

 Reaffirming the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning 

Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of 

the United Nations,1 which states, inter alia, that no State may use or encourage the 

use of unilateral economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another 

State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights,  

 Bearing in mind the general principles governing the international trading 

system and trade policies for development contained in relevant resolutions, rules and 

provisions of the United Nations and the World Trade Organization,  

 Recalling its resolutions 44/215 of 22 December 1989, 46/210 of 20 December 

1991, 48/168 of 21 December 1993, 50/96 of 20 December 1995, 52/181 of 

18 December 1997, 54/200 of 22 December 1999, 56/179 of 21 December 2001,

2007, 64/189 of 21 December 2009, 66/186 of 22 December 2011, 68/200 of 

20 December 2013, 70/185 of 22 December 2015 and 72/201 of 20 December 2017, 

 Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures 

adversely affects the economies and the development efforts of  developing countries 

in particular and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation 

and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral 

trading system, 

 Recognizing that such measures constitute a flagrant violation of the principles 

of international law as set forth in the Charter, as well as the basic principles of the 

multilateral trading system,  

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;2 

 2. Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures 

to eliminate the use of unilateral economic, financial or trade measures that are not 

authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations, that are inconsistent with the 

principles of international law or the Charter of the United Nations or that contravene 

the basic principles of the multilateral trading system and that affect, in particular, 

but not exclusively, developing countries;  

 3. Calls upon the international community to condemn and reject the 

imposition of the use of such measures as a means of political and economic coercion 

against developing countries that impedes the full achievement of economic and 

social development; 

 4. Requests the Secretary-General to monitor the imposition of unilateral 

economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion and to study the
