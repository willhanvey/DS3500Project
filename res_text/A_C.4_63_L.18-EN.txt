 Recalling the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International

20 July 2004 and ES-10/17 of 15 December 2006,  

 Noting in particular the Court’s reply, including that the construction of the

that arising from the excessive use of force, the use of collective punishment, the 
reoccupation and closure of areas, the confiscation of land, the establishment and 
expansion of settlements, the construction of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory in departure from the Armistice Line of 1949, the destruction of property 
and infrastructure, and all other actions by it designed to change the legal status, 
geographical nature and demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem,  

 Gravely concerned about the military actions that have been carried out since 
28 September 2000 and that have led to thousands of deaths among Palestinian 
civilians, including hundreds of children, and tens of thousands of injuries,  

 Expressing deep concern about the continuing deterioration in the 
humanitarian and security situation in the Gaza Strip, including that resulting from 
the Israeli military actions against civilian areas, and the prolonged closure of 
crossings into and out of the Gaza Strip, as well as from the firing of rockets into 
Israel and the negative impact of the events of June 2007 leading to the unlawful 
takeover of Palestinian Authority institutions in the Gaza Strip, 

 Expressing deep concern also about the vast destruction caused by the Israeli 
occupying forces to Palestinian homes, properties, vital infrastructure, agricultural 
lands and institutions of the Palestinian Authority, and expressing deep concern 
about the short- and long-term detrimental impact of such destruction on the 
socio-economic and humanitarian conditions and human rights of the Palestinian 
civilian population, 

 Expressing deep concern further about the Israeli policy of closures, severe 
restrictions, and a permit regime that obstruct the freedom of movement of persons 
and goods, including medical and humanitarian personnel and goods, throughout the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and about the consequent 
violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people and negative impact on their 
socio-economic situation, which remains that of a dire humanitarian crisis, 
particularly in the Gaza Strip,  

 Concerned in particular about the continued establishment of Israeli 
checkpoints in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the 
transformation of several of these checkpoints into structures akin to permanent 
border crossings inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which are severely 
impairing the territorial contiguity of the Territory and undermining efforts and aid 
aimed at rehabilitating and developing the Palestinian economy, adversely affecting 
other aspects of the socio-economic conditions of the Palestinian people, 

 Expressing deep concern that thousands of Palestinians, including hundreds of 
children and women, continue to be held in Israeli prisons or detention centres under 
harsh conditions that impair their well-being, and expressing concern about the ill 
treatment and harassment of any Palestinian prisoners and all reports of torture,  

 Convinced of the need for an international presence to monitor the situation, to 
contribute to ending the violence and protecting the Palestinian civilian population 
and to help the parties implement the agreements reached, and, in this regard, 
recalling the positive contribution of the Temporary International Presence in 
Hebron,

cease the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in 
and around East Jerusalem, dismantle forthwith the structure situated therein, repeal 
or render ineffective all legislative and regulatory acts relating thereto, and make
