The General Assembly,

Recalling the relevant principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations,

Reaffirming the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning
Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of
the United Nations,1 which states, inter alia, that no State may use or encourage the
use of unilateral economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another
State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign
rights,

Bearing in mind the general principles governing the international trading
system and trade policies for development contained in relevant resolutions, rules
and provisions of the United Nations and the World Trade Organization,

Recalling its resolutions 44/215 of 22 December 1989, 46/210 of 20 December
1991, 48/168 of 21 December 1993, 50/96 of 20 December 1995, 52/181 of 18
December 1997 and 54/200 of 22 December 1999,

Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures
adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries in
particular and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation
and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open
multilateral trading system,

1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;2

2. Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective
measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against
developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United
Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the
Charter of the United Nations and that contravene the basic principles of the
multilateral trading system;

3. Requests the Secretary-General to continue to monitor the imposition of
measures of this nature and to study the impact of such measures on the affected
countries, including the impact on trade and development;

4. Also requests the Secretary-General to submit a report to the General
Assembly at its fifty-eighth session on the implementation of the present resolution.
