Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and
financial embargo imposed by the United States of
America against Cuba

Cuba: draft resolution

Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial
embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba

The General Assembly,

Determined to encourage strict compliance with the purposes and principles
enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations,

Reaffirming, among other principles, the sovereign equality of States, non-
intervention and non-interference in their internal affairs and freedom of
international trade and navigation, which are also enshrined in many international
legal instruments,

Recalling the statements of the heads of State or Government at the Ibero-
American Summits concerning the need to eliminate the unilateral application of
economic and trade measures by one State against another that affect the free flow
of international trade,

Concerned about the continued promulgation and application by Member
States of laws and regulations, such as that promulgated on 12 March 1996 known
as the “Helms-Burton Act”, the extraterritorial effects of which affect the
sovereignty of other States, the legitimate interests of entities or persons under their
jurisdiction and the freedom of trade and navigation,

Taking note of declarations and resolutions of different intergovernmental
forums, bodies and Governments that express the rejection by the international
community and public opinion of the promulgation and application of regulations of
the kind referred to above,

Recalling its resolutions 47/19 of 24 November 1992, 48/16 of 3 November
1993, 49/9 of 26 October 1994, 50/10 of 2 November 1995, 51/17 of 12 November
1996, 52/10 of 5 November 1997, 53/4 of 14 October 1998, 54/21 of 9 November
1999, 55/20 of 9 November 2000 and 56/9 of 27 November 2001,



2

A/57/L.5

Concerned that, since the adoption of its resolutions 47/19, 48/16, 49/9, 50/10,
51/17, 52/10, 53/4, 54/21, 55/20 and 56/9, further measures of that nature aimed at
strengthening and extending the economic, commercial and financial embargo
against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied, and concerned also about the
adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living
in other countries,

1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation
of resolution 56/9;1

2. Reiterates its call upon all States to refrain from promulgating and
applying laws and measures of the kind referred to in the preamble to the present
resolution in conformity with their obligations under the Charter of the United
Nations and international law, which, inter alia, reaffirm the freedom of trade and
navigation;

3. Once again urges States that have and continue to apply such laws and
measures to take the necessary steps to repeal or invalidate them as soon as possible
in accordance with their legal regime;

4. Requests the Secretary-General, in consultation with the appropriate
organs and agencies of the United Nations system, to prepare a report on the
implementation of the present resolution in the light of the purposes and principles
of the Charter and international law and to submit it to the General Assembly at its
fifty-eighth session;

5. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-eighth session the
item entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo
imposed by the United States of America against Cuba”.
