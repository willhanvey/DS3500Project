  United States of America: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming all previous resolutions and Presidential statements concerning the 

situation in Abyei and along the border between Sudan and South Sudan and 

underlining the importance of full compliance with and implementation of these,  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 

territorial integrity of Sudan and South Sudan, and to the purposes and the principles 

of the Charter of the United Nations, and recalling the importance of the principles of 

good neighbourliness, non-interference and regional cooperation, 

 Reiterating that the territorial boundaries of States shall not be altered by force, 

and that any territorial disputes shall be settled exclusively by peaceful means, 

affirming the priority it attaches to the full and urgent implementation of all 

outstanding issues from the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), underscoring 

that the future status of Abyei shall be resolved by negotiations between the parties 

in a manner consistent with the CPA and not by the unilateral actions of either party, 

and recalling prior agreements on the administration and security of the Abyei Area,  

 Welcoming continued cooperation between the Government of the Republic of 

the Sudan and Government of the Republic of South Sudan in support of peace, 

security and stability, including with regard to the Juba Peace Agreement and the 

high-level discussions between Sudan and South Sudan in August 2021, and the 

convening of the Joint Political and Security Mechanism (JPSM) 8–9 September 2021 

and 21 October 2021, and encouraging that such meetings and those of other joint 

mechanisms take place on a consistent basis,  

 Encouraging the African Union, the African Union High-Level Implementation 

Panel (AUHIP), and the United Nations Special Envoy of the Secretary -General for 

the Horn of Africa to intensify their mediation roles with the Governments of South 

Sudan and Sudan to encourage them to establish temporary administrative and 

security arrangements for Abyei and to achieve a political solution for the status o f 

Abyei, and commending the assistance provided to the parties by the Federal 

Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, and the United Nations Interim Security Force for 

Abyei (UNISFA),  

 Acknowledging that over the course of the ten years since establishment of 

UNISFA, the mission has contributed towards the stabilization and demilitarization 

of the Abyei Area and together with the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring 

Mechanism (JBVMM) played a stabilizing role along the borders between South 

Sudan and Sudan,  



S/2021/1034 
 

 

21-19014 2/9 

 

 Expressing grave concern over recent developments in Gok Machar, South 

Sudan, including threats to the safety and security of peacekeepers which resulted in 

the death of a peacekeeper from Ethiopia on 14 September 2021, undermining the 

ability of UNISFA to support the JBVMM, stressing that the host states have the 

primary responsibility to ensure safety, security, and freedom of movement of United 

Nations personnel and assets per their obligations under the Status of Forces 

Agreements (SOFA), and urging South Sudan to intensify its outreach to the local 

community in Gok Machar to facilitate redeployment of UNISFA personnel to their 

previous locations, 

 Underlining that over the course of ten years the Government of Sudan and the 

Government of South Sudan have not made progress establishing joint institutions in 

Abyei, and encouraging Sudan and South Sudan to engage in substantive dialogue 

that can advance the political process for resolution of the Abyei dispute,  

 Expressing concern over crime in the Abyei Area, and further expressing 

concern that the delayed deployment of UN police to the level authorized by the 

Council prevents UNISFA from fulfilling its security mandate and holds the potential 

to create a security vacuum in Abyei, and further expressing concern about Sudan and 

South Sudan’s efforts to impede UNISFA from fully executing its mandate,  

 Commending the efforts of UNISFA in its attempts to carry out its mandate 

effectively, including by its ongoing facilitation of peaceful migration throughout t he 

Abyei Area, conflict prevention, mediation and deterrence, and expressing grave 

concern about the security threats and targeted attacks against United Nations 

peacekeepers in UNISFA, strongly underscoring the unacceptability of any attack on 

United Nations personnel, and reiterating that such attacks, which may constitute war 

crimes, should be swiftly and thoroughly investigated, and that those responsible 

should be held to account, 

 Noting the 17 September 2021 letter of the Secretary-General (S/2021/805), 

proposing detailed recommendations for the reconfiguration of the mission,  

 Bearing in mind that people in the Abyei Area continue to rely on humanitarian 

assistance, that access for humanitarian organizations to reach people in need remains 

of crucial importance, and that humanitarian actors continue to provide assistance to 

210,000 people in the Abyei Area, and further bearing in mind that support to 

livelihoods and resilience at the community level are critical to ending conflict driven 

by food insecurity, 

 Recalling resolutions 1325 (2000) and subsequent resolutions on Women, 

Peace, and Security and emphasizing that persistent barriers to full impl ementation 

of these resolutions will only be dismantled through dedicated commitment to 

women’s empowerment, participation, and human rights, and through concerted 

leadership, consistent information and action, and support,  

 Recognizing that the current situation in Abyei and along the border between 

Sudan and South Sudan continues to constitute a threat to international peace and 

security,
