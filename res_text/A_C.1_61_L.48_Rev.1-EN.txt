  Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Reiterating that the cessation of nuclear-weapon test explosions or any other 
nuclear explosions constitutes an effective nuclear disarmament and 
non-proliferation measure, and convinced that this is a meaningful step in the 
realization of a systematic process to achieve nuclear disarmament, 

 Recalling that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, adopted by its 
resolution 50/245 of 10 September 1996, was opened for signature on 24 September 
1996, 

 Stressing that a universal and effectively verifiable Comprehensive Nuclear-
Test-Ban Treaty constitutes a fundamental instrument in the field of nuclear 
disarmament and non-proliferation and that after ten years, its entry into force is 
more urgent than ever before,  

 Encouraged by the signing of the Treaty by one hundred and seventy-six 
States, including forty-one of the forty-four needed for its entry into force, and 
welcoming the ratification of one hundred and twenty-five States, including 
thirty-four of the forty-four needed for its entry into force, among which there are 
three nuclear-weapon States, 

 
 

 * Reissued for technical reasons.

 Recalling its resolution 60/95 of 8 December 2005, 

 Welcoming the Final Declaration of the fourth Conference on Facilitating the 
Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, held in New York 
from 21 to 23 September 2005,1 pursuant to article XIV of the Treaty, and the 
Ministerial Meeting of States Parties held in New York on 20 September 2006, 

 1. Stresses the vital importance and urgency of signature and ratification, 
without delay and without conditions, to achieve the earliest entry into force of the 
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty; 

 2. Welcomes the contributions by the States signatories to the work of the 
Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty 
Organization, in particular its efforts to ensure that the Treaty’s verification regime 
will be capable of meeting the verification requirements of the Treaty upon its entry 
into force, in accordance with article IV of the Treaty; 

 3. Underlines the need to maintain momentum towards completion of the 
verification regime; 

 4. Urges all States to maintain their moratoriums on nuclear-weapon test 
explosions or any other nuclear explosions and to refrain from acts that would 
defeat the object and purpose of the Treaty, while stressing that these measures do 
not have the same permanent and legally binding effect as the entry into force of the 
Treaty; 

 5. Condemns the nuclear test proclaimed by the Democratic People’s 
Republic of Korea on 9 October 2006, and demands that the Democratic People’s 
Republic of Korea not conduct any further nuclear tests; 

 6. Urges all States that have not yet signed the Treaty to sign and ratify it as 
soon as possible; 

 7. Urges all States that have signed but not yet ratified the Treaty, in 
particular those whose ratification is needed for its entry into force, to accelerate 
their ratification processes with a view to ensuring their earliest successful 
conclusion; 

 8. Urges all States to remain seized of the issue at the highest political level 
and, where in a position to do so, to promote adherence to the Treaty through 
bilateral and joint outreach, seminars and other means; 

 9. Requests the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Preparatory 
Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, to 
prepare a report on the efforts of States that have ratified the Treaty towards its 
universalization and possibilities for providing assistance on ratification procedures 
to States that so request it, and to submit such a report to the General Assembly at 
its sixty-second session; 

 10. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-second session 
the item entitled “Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty”.
