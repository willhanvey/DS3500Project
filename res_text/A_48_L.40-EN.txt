The General Assembly,

Recalling its previous resolutions, including resolution 47/65 of

Recognizing, that as stated in the third preambular paragraph of the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 1/ the problems of ocean space are
closely interrelated and need to be considered as a whole,

Convinced that it is important to safeguard the unified character of the
Convention and related resolutions adopted therewith and to apply them in a
manner consistent with that character and with their object and purpose,

Emphasizing the need for States to ensure consistent application of the
Convention, as well as the need for harmonization of national legislation with
the provisions of the Convention,

Considering, that in its resolution 2749 (XXV) of 17 December 1970, it
proclaimed that the seabed and ocean floor, and the subsoil thereof, beyond the
limits of national jurisdiction (hereinafter referred to as "the Area"), as well
as the resources of the Area, are the common heritage of mankind,

Recalling that the Convention provides the regime to be applied to the Area

registration entails both rights and obligations for pioneer investors,

Noting the increasing needs of countries, especially developing countries,
for information, advice and assistance in the implementation of the Convention
and in their developmental process for the full realization of the benefits of
the comprehensive legal regime established by the Convention,

measures for the full realization of these benefits owing to the lack of
resources and of the necessary scientific and technological capabilities,

Recognizing the need to enhance and supplement the efforts of States and
competent international organizations aimed at enabling developing countries to
acquire such capabilities,

Recognizing also that the Convention encompasses all uses and resources of
the sea and that all related activities within the United Nations system need to
be implemented in a manner consistent with it,
