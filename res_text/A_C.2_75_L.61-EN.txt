and, where appropriate, integrated manner, reducing duplication and increasing 

impact;  

 47. Stresses that core resources are the bedrock of the United Nations

expresses concern at the continuing and accelerated decline in the share of core 

contributions to the entities of the United Nations development system in recent years;  

 48. Acknowledges the efforts by developed countries to increase resources for 

development, including commitments by some developed countries to increase 

official development assistance, expresses concern that many countrie s still fall short 

of their official development assistance commitments, including the commitments by 

many developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national 

income for official development assistance, as well as the target of 0.15  per cent to 

0.20 per cent for least developed countries, and urges those developed countries that

contribute on a multi-year basis, in a sustained and predictable manner, and 

encourages Member States to protect core contributions in case of financial 

constraints;  

 52. Notes that non-core resources represent an important contribution to the 

overall resource base of United Nations operational activities for development as a 

complement to, and not a substitute for, core resources, and that they should support 

and be aligned with programme priorities regulated by intergovernmental bodies and 

processes, and also notes that non-core resources pose their own challenges by 

potentially increasing transaction costs, fragmentation, unproductive competition and 

overlap among entities and/or providing disincentives for pursuing system -wide 

priorities, strategic positioning and coherence;  

 53. Urges Member States and other contributors providing non-core 

contributions, to the extent practicable, to make them more flexible and aligned with 

the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework, 26 as well as 

the strategic plans of United Nations funds, programmes and specialized agencies, to

reduce transaction costs by, inter alia, streamlining and harmonizing requirements 

related to reporting, monitoring and evaluation, to assign resources, as much as 

possible, at the beginning of the annual planning period, while encouraging multi -

year duration of implementation of development-related activities, and to give 

priority to pooled, thematic and joint funding mechanisms applied at all levels, where 

appropriate, and limit earmarking to activities in accordance with the national 

priorities of programme countries;  

 54. Welcomes the funding compact, noting its voluntary nature, and 

encourages all Member States and entities of the United Nations development system 

to contribute to its full and effective implementation and to continue the dialogue, 

inter alia, in the respective governing bodies to jointly make progress towards 

compliance with their funding compact commitments to help achieve development 

results on the ground, taking note of the progress made thus far in the fulfilment of 

the funding compact commitments by all parties;  

 55. Urges the entities of the United Nations development system to continue 

enhancing the transparency and accountability of inter-agency pooled funding 

mechanisms, as well as to continue developing well-designed pooled funds, as a 

complement to agency-specific funds, that reflect and support common objectives and 

cross-cutting issues for United Nations funds, programmes and specialized agencies, 

and urges the entities of the United Nations development system to enhance their 

participation, where appropriate, in such funding mechanisms;  

 56. Also urges the entities of the United Nations development system, through 

their governing bodies, to continue taking concrete steps to address on a continuous 

basis the decline of the share of core contributions and the growing imbalance 

between core and non-core resources, including by, but not limited to:  

 (a) Exploring options on how to incentivize donor countries, other countries 

in a position to do so and other contributors to ensure an adequate and predicta ble 

level of core and non-core funding on a multi-year basis, including enhancing 

reporting and demonstration of programme results;  

 (b) Identifying, in the context of integrated results and resources frameworks, 

the level of resources adequate to produce the results expected in their strategic plans, 

including administrative, management and programme support costs;  

 (c) Exploring options to broaden and diversify the donor base in order to 

reduce the reliance of the system on a limited number of donors;  

 57. Reaffirms the principle of full cost recovery, proportionally from core and 

non-core resources, thereby avoiding the use of core or regular resources to subsidize 

activities financed by non-core or extrabudgetary resources, and reiterates its request 

to the United Nations development system to analyse and explore in a collaborative 

manner options for harmonized cost-recovery policies, based on common cost 

classification and cost-recovery methodologies, noting in this regard the good 

practice established through the common cost-recovery policy of the United Nations 

Development Programme, the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations 

Children’s Fund and UN-Women, as adopted by their respective Executive Boards in 

2020 and invites relevant governing bodies to review evidence-based proposals for
