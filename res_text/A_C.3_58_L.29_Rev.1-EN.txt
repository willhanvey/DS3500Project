Welcoming the appointment by the Secretary-General of the independent
expert for the United Nations study on violence against children,

Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world
remains critical as a result of the persistence of poverty, social inequality, inadequate
social and economic conditions in an increasingly globalized economic
environment, pandemics, in particular human immunodeficiency virus/acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), malaria, tuberculosis, environmental
damage, natural disasters, armed conflict, displacement, exploitation, illiteracy,
hunger, intolerance, discrimination, gender inequality, disability and inadequate
legal protection, and convinced that urgent and effective national and international
action is called for,

Bearing in mind the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-
Violence for the Children of the World, 2001-2010, and recalling the Declaration
and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace,12 which serve as the basis for the
Decade,

Recognizing that the family is the basic unit of society and as such should be
strengthened, that it is entitled to receive comprehensive protection and support, that
the primary responsibility for the protection, upbringing and development of
children rests with the family, and that all institutions of society should respect the
rights of the child and secure his or her well-being and render appropriate assistance
to parents, families, legal guardians and other caregivers so that children can grow
and develop in a safe and stable environment and in an atmosphere of happiness,
love and understanding, bearing in mind that in different cultural, social and
political systems, various forms of family exist,

Recognizing also that partnership among Governments, international
organizations and relevant organs and organizations of the United Nations system, in
particular the United Nations Children’s Fund, and all actors of civil society,
including non-governmental organizations, as well as the private sector, is important
to realize the rights of the child,

Underlining the need for mainstreaming a gender perspective in all policies
and programmes relating to children,

her parents against their will, except when the competent authorities, subject to
judicial review, determine, in accordance with applicable law and procedures, that
such separation is necessary in the best interest of the child, and, where alternative
care is necessary, to promote family and community-based care in preference to
