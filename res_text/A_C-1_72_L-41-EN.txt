  Implementation of the Convention on Cluster Munitions  
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 63/71 of 2 December 2008 on the Convention on 

Cluster Munitions, 70/54 of 7 December 2015 and 71/45 of 5 December 2016 on the 

implementation of the Convention,  

 Reaffirming its determination to put an end for all time to the suffering and 

casualties caused by cluster munitions at the time of their use, when they fail to 

function as intended or when they are abandoned,  

 Deploring the recent rise in cluster munition use and related civilian 

casualties, and calling upon those who continue to use cluster munition to cease any 

such activity immediately,  

 Conscious that cluster munition remnants kill or maim civilians, including 

women and children, obstruct economic and social development, including through 

the loss of livelihood, impede post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction, delay 

or prevent the return of refugees and internally displaced persons, can have a 

negative impact on national and international peacebuilding and humanitarian 

assistance efforts, and have other severe consequences for many years after use,  

 Concerned about the dangers presented by the large national stockpiles of 

cluster munitions retained for operational use, and determined to ensure their rapid 

destruction,  

 Believing it necessary to contribute effectively in an efficient, coordinated 

manner to resolving the challenge of removing cluster munition remnants located 

throughout the world, and to ensure their destruction,

 Mindful of the need to coordinate adequately efforts undertaken in various 

forums, including through the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 

Disabilities,
1
 to address the rights and needs of victims of various types of weapons, 

and resolved to avoid discrimination among victims of various types of weapons,  

 Reaffirming that in cases not covered by the Convention on Cluster Munitions
2
 

or by other international agreements, civilians and combatants remain under the 

protection and authority of the principles of international law, derived from 

established custom, from the principles of humanity and from the dictates of public 

conscience,  

 Welcoming the steps taken nationally, regionally and globally in recent years 

aimed at prohibiting, restricting or suspending the use, stockpiling, production and 

transfer of cluster munitions, and welcoming in this regard that, since 2014, all 

Central American States have joined the Convention, thus fulfilling their aspiration 

to become the first cluster munitions-free region in the world,  

 Stressing the role of public conscience in furthering the principles of 

humanity, as evidenced by the global call for an end to civilian suffering caused by 

cluster munitions, and recognizing the efforts to that end undertaken by the United 

Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Cluster Munition 

Coalition and numerous other non-governmental organizations around the world,  

 Noting that a total of 119 States have joined the Convention, 102 as States 

parties and 17 as signatories,  

 Taking note of the 2015 Dubrovnik Declaration
3
 and the Dubrovnik Action 

Plan
4
 adopted at the First Review Conference of States Parties to the Convention on 

Cluster Munitions, held in Dubrovnik, Croatia, from 7 to 11 September 2015,  

 Taking note also of the political declaration establishing 2030 as a target date 

to implement all individual and collective outstanding obligations under the 

Convention as adopted by consensus under the presidency of the Netherlands at the 

Sixth Meeting of States Parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions, held in 

Geneva from 5 to 7 September 2016,  

 Welcoming the dialogue undertaken by the German presidency of the Seventh 

Meeting of States Parties with States not parties to the Convention, including the 

military-to-military dialogue, in support of universal adherence to the Convention, 

and recognizing the assistance that the country coalition concept can provide to 

affected countries in the implementation of their obligations under the Convention,  

 1. Urges all States outside the Convention on Cluster Munitions
2
 to join as 

soon as possible, whether by ratifying or acceding to it, and all States parties that 

are in a position to do so to promote adherence to the Convention through bilateral, 

subregional and multilateral contacts, outreach and other means;  

 2. Stresses the importance of the full and effective implementation of and 

compliance with the Convention, including through the implementation of the 

Dubrovnik Action Plan;
4
  

 3. Expresses strong concern regarding the rising number of allegations, 

reports or documented evidence of the use of cluster munitions in different parts of 

the world and related civilian casualties;
