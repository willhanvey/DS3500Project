developments with regard to the operationalization of human rights monitoring in 

the Abyei Area, and reiterating its concern at the lack of cooperation by the parties 

with the Secretary-General to this end,  

 Recalling that its resolution 2086 (2013) reiterates the importance, when 

establishing and renewing the mandates of United Nations Missions, of including 

provisions on the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women in 

post-conflict situations and on children and armed conflict, and emphasizing that 

persistent barriers to full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), and subsequent 

resolutions on Women, Peace, and Security, including 2242 (2015), will only be 

dismantled through dedicated commitment to women’s empowerment, participation, 

and human rights, and through concerted leadership, consistent information and 

action, and support, to build women’s engagement in all levels of decision-making,  

 Acknowledging the Government of Sudan and the Government of South 

Sudan’s acceptance at the 13-14 October 2015 JPSM meeting of the map presented 

by the AUHIP in November 2011 relating to the SDBZ, their agreement that the 

centreline is only the location of the separation line between armed forces, as well 

as the Parties’ agreement to activate all mechanisms relating to the JPSM as 

provided for in relevant agreements, and encouraging the parties to delineate or 

agree on the coordinates of, and demilitarize the SDBZ, including the “14 Mile 

Area”, and to fully implement the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring 

Mechanism (JBVMM), in accordance with Security Council resolution 2046 (2012)

the “14 Mile Area”, and further urging the parties to cooperate in allowing the 

United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) to fulfil its 

responsibility to provide security for the JBVMM’s mission to monitor the SDBZ,  

 Noting with concern the absence of local institutions to manage the Abyei 

Area, lack of progress in convening an Abyei Joint Oversight Committee (AJOC) 

meeting since March 2015 and lack of progress in convening a meeting of Misseriya 

and Ngok Dinka leaders,  



 
S/2015/966 

 

3/8 15-22186 

 

 Recognizing the importance of regular dialogue between the Governments of

reach agreement on Abyei final status under the auspices of the AUHIP, calling 

upon all parties to engage constructively in the process mediated by the AUHIP 

towards final agreement on the final status of the Abyei Area, and stressing that the 

parties must immediately implement pending aspects of the 20 June 2011 

Agreement, in particular to resolve the dispute over the Abyei Area Agreement, and 

to resolve the dispute over the Abyei Area Council, and immediately establish the 

Abyei Area Administration and Abyei Police Service,  

 Stressing that both countries and communities will have much to gain if they 

show restraint and choose the path of dialogue instead of resorting to violence or 

provocations,  

 Commending the continued assistance provided to the parties by the AUHIP, 

the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the Federal Democratic Republic 

of Ethiopia, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Sudan and South Sudan, 

and the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA),  

 Further commending the efforts of UNISFA in effectively carrying out its 

mandate, including by its ongoing facilitation of peaceful migration throughout the 

Abyei Area, conflict prevention, mediation and deterrence, and expressing its deep 

appreciation for the work of the troop-contributing countries, and strongly 

underscoring the unacceptability of any attack on UN personnel, including the 

26 November attack that resulted in the death of a peacekeeper, and reiterating that 

such attacks should be swiftly and thoroughly investigated, and that those 

responsible should be held to account,  

 Taking note of the security situation in the Abyei Area as characterized by the 

11 September 2015 and 13 November 2015 Secretary-General’s reports (S/2015/700 

and S/2015/870), and acknowledging UNISFA’s contribution to enhanced peace and 

stability since its deployment and expressing its determination to prevent the 

recurrence of violence against or displacements of civilians and to avert 

intercommunal conflict,  

 Reiterating its deep concern regarding the public administration and rule of 

law vacuum in the Abyei Area, due to continued delays in the establishment of the 

Abyei Area Administration Council and Police, including a special unit to deal with 

particular issues related to nomadic migration, which are essential to maintain law 

and order and prevent intercommunal conflict in Abyei, and in this regard, 

welcoming UNISFA’s efforts to support and strengthen community protection 

committees, and to continue engaging with both governments on this issue,  

 Noting with concern the continued delay in establishing the temporary 

institutions and resolving the final status of Abyei and that the continued threat of 

intercommunal violence contributes to heightened tensions in the Abyei Area, 

including those ongoing tensions that prevent UNISFA’s and other agencies’ 

Sudanese staff from returning to Abyei,  

 Urging all parties to refrain from any unilateral action that could aggravate 

intercommunal relations within the Abyei Area, expressing concern over the 

continued implications of what the AUPSC described in their 6 November 2013 

press statement as “the decision by the Ngok Dinka to conduct a unilateral

S/2015/966

referendum” and also in this context, taking note that the Government of Sudan

report (S/2015/870) regarding continued earthwork excavation in Diffra,  

 Bearing in mind the current humanitarian situation in which humanitarian 

actors continue to provide assistance to over 89,000 people in the Abyei Area and 

the importance of coherence of United Nations assistance in the region, and further 

stressing the urgency of facilitating the delivery of humanitarian assistance to all 

affected populations,  

 Affirming the importance of voluntary, safe, dignified return and sustainable 

reintegration of displaced persons, and of peaceful and orderly migration cycles 

respecting the traditional migratory routes from Sudan to South Sudan through 

Abyei, and urging UNISFA to continue to take measures as necessary to ensure 

security in the Abyei Area in accordance with its mandate,  

 Recalling its resolution 2117 (2013), and expressing grave concern at the 

threat to peace and security in Abyei arising from the illicit transfer, destabilizing 

accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons, and in this regard, 

welcoming UNISFA’s progress on completing infrastructure, systems, and policy for 

weapons confiscation, storage and destruction,  

 Expressing concern about the residual threat of landmines and explosive 

remnants of war in the Abyei Area, which hinders the safe return of displaced 

persons to their homes, safe migration, and livelihood activities,  

 Taking note of the 11 September 2015 and 13 November 2015 Secretary-

General’s reports (S/2015/700 and S/2015/870), including the hope that the 

momentum for dialogue between the two governments can revive implementation of 

the 20 June 2011 Abyei Agreement and translate into a sustainable improvement of 

border security, and the recommendations contained therein,  

 Recognizing that the current situation in Abyei and along the border between

engagement, and requests the Secretary-General to provide an assessment of

commence the establishment of the Abyei Area Administration and Council,

on a set of conditions, including resolution of the dispute over the SDBZ, 

resumption of border demarcation discussions, occurrence of regular meetings of 

the JPSM, and granting of full freedom of movement, and calls on both parties to 

demonstrate full commitment to implementation of their border arrangements and 

take the necessary steps to this effect, including by swiftly holding a new meeting of 

the JPSM to take the operational decisions related to their agreement on the SDBZ;  

 6. Decides to maintain the troops authorized by resolution 2104 (2013) 

already deployed, and that the remaining authorized forces continue to be deployed 

dependent on the evolution of the JBVMM, to enable UNISFA to provide required 

force protection to the JBVMM and to enable UNISFA to fully support the JBVMM

current or future legal status of the border, ongoing negotiations on the disputed and 

claimed areas, and demarcation of the borders;

source of such violence;

the area, and in this regard, urges the two Governments to take all necessary steps to 

ensure that Abyei is effectively demilitarized, including through disarmament 

programs as necessary;
