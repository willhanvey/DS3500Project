 The Security Council,  

 Recalling its primary responsibility under the Charter of the United Nations 

for the maintenance of international peace and security,  

 Recalling its resolution 2185 (2014) on United Nations Policing, as well as

effectively address the challenges of the twenty-first century, 

 Stressing the primary responsibility of States for the prevention and resolution 

of conflicts, as well as for the protection of civilians and the important contribution 

that United Nations Policing in peacekeeping and special political missions can 

provide throughout the conflict cycle, where and as mandated, including through the 

protection of civilians, capacity-building and development efforts of host-State 

police services, and noting the relevance of its contribution when considering the 

broader reform of the peace and security pillar,  

 Affirming that lasting peace is not achieved nor sustained by military and 

technical engagements alone, but through political solutions and strongly convinced 

that such political solutions should guide the design and deployment of United 

Nations peacekeeping operations, 

 Reaffirming its commitment to upholding the purposes and principles of the 

Charter of the United Nations, including its commitment to and respect for the 

principles of political independence, sovereign equality and territorial integrity of 

all States in conducting all peacekeeping activities and the need for States to comply

specific to the need and situation of the country concerned, and that the Security 

Council expects full delivery of the mandates it authorizes, 

 Welcoming the role that UN Police Components can play in facilitating the 

transitions from peacekeeping to development and peacebuilding, and recognizing 

that improved performance of United Nations Policing can contribute to successful 

exit strategies of peacekeeping missions and will require continued transparent and 

accountable efforts to strengthen United Nations Police doctrine and its 

implementation and defining clearer standards for personnel, equipment, operations, 

performance, and assistance to host-State police services, as well as increased 

training and capacity-building to prepare police contributing countries and ensure 

predictable deployment, 

 Stressing that the successful implementation of the mandates of peacekeeping 

operations and special political missions requires close cooperation and use of 

integrated planning mechanisms between the different elements of these missions, 

including between police, military and civilian components, under the overall 

leadership of the Head of Mission,  

 Noting the important role United Nations Policing can play, where mandated, 

in strengthening the rule of law and security sector reform and reaffirming the lead 

role of national authorities in progressing the reform of police and other law 

enforcement agencies as part of wider rule of law and security sector reform efforts, 

including in dedicating national resources towards national police and other law 

enforcement institutions, and monitoring the impact of police reform, and 

recognizing that the political leadership and political will of national authorities are 

critical in this regard and success necessitates national ownership,  

 Highlighting the important role that United Nations Police Components can 

play in building the capacity of host-State policing and other law enforcement 

institutions, as mandated, in particular through building principles of community 

oriented policing and in addressing organized crime, particularly through support in 

the areas of border, immigration and maritime security and crime prevention, 

response and investigation, where mandated,  

 Having considered that transnational organized crime undermines stability and 

further considering that transnational organized crime can benefit international 

terrorism, which may require strengthening or rebuilding of criminal justice systems 

to address relevant threats,  

 Recalling the work conducted by the Security Council Working Group on 

Peacekeeping Operations, the Fourth and Fifth Committees of the General Assembly 

and the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, which have provided 

guidance to the Secretariat on United Nations policing including on a standardized 

approach to United Nations Policing and compliance thereto, as well as support to 

the United Nations Secretariat to address capacity and capability gaps, where they 

exist, thereby improving the performance of United Nations Policing,  

 Noting the increasing scope and reliance on police abilities in United Nations 

operations and welcoming ongoing efforts to attain specialized capacities, 

capabilities and technologies for United Nations Police Components, further noting 

the Policy for Formed Police Units in United Nations Peacekeeping and 

encouraging Member States to contribute well-trained and appropriately vetted men 

and women police personnel with appropriate language skills for formed police 

units (FPUs) with the full complement of agreed contingent -owned equipment, 

specialized police teams (SPTs) and individual police officers, as well as civilian 

experts, to effectively implement mandated tasks and facilitate the conditions for 

transitions and exits,  



 
S/2017/926 

 

3/7 17-19625 

 

 Noting that host-State policing institutions should be the primary link between 

the government, individuals and communities on security issues, reiterating that 

professional, effective, accountable, and accessible law enforcement, corrections, 

and judicial institutions are necessary to lay the foundation for sustainable peace 

and national development, and further noting that failure to address operational and 

accountability deficits in police institutions can undermine the positive gains made, 

and thus risks a relapse into conflict,  

 Recognizing the indispensable role of women in United Nations peacekeeping 

and special political missions, including the critical role that women play i n all 

peace and security efforts, including by providing diverse perspectives which can 

assist in building trust with local communities and stressing the need to increase 

their participation and leadership in decision-making in host-States with regard to 

policing and the rule of law,  

 Welcoming the efforts to incentivize greater numbers of women in military and 

police deployed and appointed to senior positions in United Nations peacekeeping 

operations, as both IPOs and as part of SPTs and FPUs, and efforts  to review the 

obstacles preventing women’s recruitment and professional advancement; taking 

note in this regard of the Secretary-General’s System-wide Strategy on Gender 

Parity which tasks relevant United Nations entities, in consultation with Police -

Contributing countries, to develop a separate, dedicated strategy on this matter,  

 Reaffirming its determination to pursue more prioritization when evaluating, 

mandating and reviewing United Nations peacekeeping operations, including 

through strengthening Triangular consultations with Troop and Police-Contributing 

Countries and the Secretariat, strengthening existing formal mechanisms, and 

underlining the shared responsibility for meaningful, inclusive, active and dynamic 

consultations, as well as enhancing its dialogue with host countries, with the aim of 

fully and successfully implementing peacekeeping mandates,  

 Noting with appreciation the improved cooperation between the United 

Nations, international, regional and subregional organizations and initiatives , 

including through training, sharing of experience, exchange of information, 

thematic expertise and operational readiness as appropriate, and the establishment 

by the United Nations Police Components of a serious and organized crime focal 

point network, and further noting that these efforts can strengthen host -State police 

and other law enforcement agencies’ capacities and capabilities to counter 

transnational threats,  

 1. Stresses that the primacy of political solutions should be the hallmark of 

the approach of the United Nations to the resolution of conflict and resolves to 

include, on a case by case basis, policing as an integral part of the mandates and 

decision-making structures of United Nations peacekeeping operations and special 

political missions, taking into account the need for consistent integration of police 

expertise within the planning of such missions, and to give clear, credible, 

achievable, appropriately resourced mandates for policing -related activities, and 

emphasizes in this context the need to ensure a United Nations system-wide 

approach to the rule of law;  

 2. Underscores the critical importance of improving accountability, 

transparency, efficiency and effectiveness in the performance of United Nations 

peacekeeping operations and special political missions and calls on the Secretariat 

to continue efforts to strengthen doctrine and define clear standards for personnel, 

equipment, operations, performance, and assistance to host nation police forces for 

effective performance of United Nations Police in missions, as well as for preparing 

Police-Contributing Countries for deployment, and requests the United Nations’ 

Secretariat to assist Member States’ training activities by providing timely and 



S/2017/926 
 

 

17-19625 4/7 

 

complete information regarding the training needs of Police -Contributing Countries 

and those with the capacity to deliver such training,  to ensure coherence and 

identify where capability gaps remain, thereby enhancing triangular cooperation;  

 3. Reaffirms its ongoing efforts to review peacekeeping operations to ensure 

maximum effectiveness and efficiency on the ground, and to deepen these  efforts in 

partnership with Police Contributing Countries, and requests the Secretary -General 

to ensure data streams related to the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations, 

including peacekeeping performance data, to include police, are centralized to 

improve analytics and evaluation of mission operations, based on clear and well 

identified benchmarks; 

 4. Resolves to continue to promote and support the finalization and 

operationalization of the Strategic Guidance Framework for International Police 

Peacekeeping, to conduct targeted recruitment based on identified field needs and 

develop a measurable accountability framework for the implementation of 

mandates, and requests the Secretary-General to consider undertaking the following 

to ensure the timely completion of country-specific mandates and improve 

performance:  

 (a) Strengthen the collaboration of United Nations Policing with the 

Peacekeeping Strategic Force Generation and Capability Planning Cell, so that 

police and military requirements are coordinated, force generation occurs in concert

police services more accessible and responsive to women, in order to improve 

Security Council oversight of police reform and protection of civilians activities in 

accordance with resolutions 2122 (2013) and 2242 (2015); 

 5. Recognizes the role of United Nations Policing in contributing, as 

appropriate, to the United Nations’ efforts to prevent conflicts through, inter alia, as 

mandated, protection of civilians, and assisting host-States with relevant capacity-

building and calls on the Secretary-General to make sure that planning of United 

Nations peacekeeping and special political missions with police mandates are based 

on a thorough analysis of the context, capacities and needs of host -States; 

 6. Reaffirms that States bear the primary responsibility for protection of 

civilians and recognizes the important role that United Nations Police Components 

can play, where and as mandated, in the protection of civilians, including in 

preventing and addressing sexual and gender based violence, and, where applicable, 

conflict-related sexual violence and violations and abuses against children in the 

context of conflict and post-conflict situations, including, where appropriate,

regard the importance of specialized predeployment and in-mission training on 

mission-specific child protection and on appropriate comprehensive child -sensitive 

prevention and protection responses, as well as monitoring and reporting on 

violations and abuses committed against children, and stressing the importance of
