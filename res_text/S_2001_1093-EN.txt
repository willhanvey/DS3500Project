the implementation of resolution 1314 (2000) on children and armed conflict,

1. Expresses, accordingly, its determination to give the fullest attention to
the question of the protection of children in armed conflict when considering the
matters of which it is seized;

of children, when considering the mandates of peacekeeping operations, and
