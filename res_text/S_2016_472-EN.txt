 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions and statements by its President on the 

situation in Liberia,  

 Welcoming the sustained progress made by the Government of Liberia in 

rebuilding Liberia for the benefit of all Liberians,  

 Commending the work of the Committee established pursuant to resolution 

1521 (2003) (“the Committee”) and expressing its gratitude to the Panel of Experts 

established pursuant to paragraph 22 of resolution 1521 (2003),  

 Having considered the report of the United Nations Panel of Experts on 

Liberia (S/2016/348) as well as the briefing to the Security Council by the Chair of 

the Committee on 13 May 2016,  

 Having also considered the Secretary-General’s letter, dated 31 July 2015 

(S/2015/590), updating the Security Council on progress made by the Government 

of Liberia to implement the recommendations on the proper management of arms 

and ammunition, including enacting the necessary laws, and on facilitating the 

effective monitoring and management of the border regions between Liberia and 

Côte d’Ivoire, while stressing the need that such progress continue in order to 

further contribute to the peace and stability of Liberia,  

 Recalling that responsibility for controlling the circulation of small arms 

within the territory of Liberia and between Liberia and neighbouring States rests 

with the relevant governmental authorities in accordance with their obligations 

under the Economic Community of West African States Convention on Small Arms 

and Light Weapons of 2006,  

 Encouraging the Government of Liberia to expedite the adoption and 

implementation of remaining appropriate arms and ammunition management 

legislation and to continue to take other necessary and appropriate steps to establish 

the necessary legal and administrative framework to combat the illicit trafficking of 

arms and ammunition,  

 Noting the positive role that the Security Council’s imposition of targeted 

measures has played in responding to the conflict in Liberia and supporting 

Liberia’s stabilization,

 Affirming that the Government of Liberia bears primary responsibility for 

protecting all populations within its territory, stressing that lasting stability in 

Liberia will require the Government of Liberia to sustain effective and accountable 

government institutions, particularly in the rule of law and security sectors, 

including capable, professional, and efficient military, police and border security 

forces, and, in this regard, welcoming the relevant assistance of bilateral partners 

and multilateral organizations,  

 Underlining that the transparent and effective management of natural 

resources is critical for Liberia’s sustainable peace and security,  

 Recalling the Council’s readiness to terminate the measures imposed by 

paragraphs 2 (a) and (b) of resolution 1521 (2003) upon its determination that the 

ceasefire in Liberia is being fully respected and maintained, disarmament, 

demobilization, reintegration, repatriation and restructuring of the security sector 

have been completed, the provisions of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement are 

being fully implemented, and significant progress has been made in establishing and 

maintaining stability in Liberia and the subregion, and determining that those 

conditions have been met,
