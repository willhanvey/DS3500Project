  France, Germany, Portugal and United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland: draft resolution 
 
 

 Commending the efforts of the United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria 
(UNSMIS), 

 1. Decides to renew the mandate of UNSMIS for a final period of 30 days, 
taking into consideration the Secretary-General’s recommendations to reconfigure 
the Mission, and taking into consideration the operational implications of the 
increasingly dangerous security situation in Syria; 

 2. Calls upon the parties to assure the safety of UNSMIS personnel without 
prejudice to its freedom of movement and access, and stresses that the primary 
responsibility in this regard lies with the Syrian authorities; 

 3. Expresses its willingness to renew the mandate of UNSMIS thereafter 
only in the event that the Secretary-General reports and the Security Council 
confirms the cessation of the use of heavy weapons and a reduction in the level of 
violence by all sides sufficient to allow UNSMIS to implement its mandate; 

 4. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Council on the 
implementation of this resolution within 15 days; 

 5. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
