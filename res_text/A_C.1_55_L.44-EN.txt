The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolution 54/54 B of 1 December 1999,

Reaffirming its determination to put an end to the suffering and casualties
caused by anti-personnel mines, which kill or maim hundreds of people every week,
mostly innocent and defenceless civilians and especially children, obstruct economic
development and reconstruction, inhibit the repatriation of refugees and internally
displaced persons, and have other severe consequences for years after emplacement,

Believing it necessary to do the utmost to contribute in an efficient and
coordinated manner to facing the challenge of removing anti-personnel mines placed
throughout the world, and to assure their destruction,
