 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political 

independence and unity of Somalia,  

 Taking note of the Secretary-General’s letter of 7 October 2015 covering 

United Nations support activities in Somalia (“the Secretary-General’s letter” 

S/2015/762), 

 Taking note of the African Union Peace and Security Council’s 18 September 

2015 communiqué on UNSOA, 

 Noting with appreciation the positive contributions that the UN Support Office 

to AMISOM (UNSOA) has made to supporting the gains made by the African Union 

Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and the UN Assistance Mission in Somalia 

(UNSOM), and underscoring that such contributions are evidence of a successful 

partnership between the United Nations, the African Union and Member States in 

Somalia, 

 Expressing further its gratitude to AMISOM and Somali National Army (SNA) 

personnel for the sacrifices which they have made in the fight against Al Shabaab,  

 Expressing concern at the Secretary-General’s finding that despite the 

innovation and best efforts of UNSOA, its resources and resultant capacities have 

not been able to keep pace with the dramatic expansion of the requested logistical 

support and that there is a progressively widening gap between the logistical support 

UNSOA is requested to deliver and its capacity to deliver,  

 Welcoming the observations and recommendations of the Secretary-General to 

address gaps in UNSOA’s ability to deliver, and further welcoming the steps already 

being taken and urging their full implementation as a matter of urgency,  

 1. Emphasizes the role and impact of a responsive, effective, efficient and 

responsible field support platform as a strategic enabler in Somalia, and in view of 

the expansion of UNSOA’s mission since its establishment in 2009, decides that 

UNSOA shall bear the name of the UN Support Office in Somalia (UNSOS) (and 

which will be responsible for support to AMISOM, UNSOM and the Somali 

National Army on joint operations with AMISOM);

 2. Welcomes the Secretary-General’s assessment that UNSOS should 

consolidate and prioritise its efforts in line with the Security Council’s strategic 

objectives in Somalia, and in that context and on an exceptional basis and owing to 

the unique character of AMISOM, requests that the Secretary-General continue to 

provide, under the Department of Field Support, logistical support primarily to a 

maximum of 22,126 uniformed personnel in AMISOM and 70 AMISOM civilians, 

the SNA on joint operations with AMISOM, and UNSOM as follows:

and practices and subject to periodic reviews by UNSOS to ensure full provision,

required by the United Nations and the African Union in the categories above, 

limited support in lieu of reimbursement will be provided to ensure basic and
