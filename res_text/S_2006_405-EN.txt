of 14 August 2000,  

 Recalling article 10 of the Agreement pursuant to which the Special Court may

courageous decision to request the transfer of former President Taylor in order that 
he may be tried at the Special Court,  

 Expressing its appreciation to President Obasanjo of Nigeria on his decision to 
facilitate the transfer of former President Taylor, and noting the role Nigeria has 
played in securing and promoting peace in Liberia and the wider subregion, 
including President Obasanjo’s decision in 2003 to facilitate the removal of former 
President Taylor from Liberia which allowed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement 
to take effect, and recognizing the contribution made by the Economic Community
