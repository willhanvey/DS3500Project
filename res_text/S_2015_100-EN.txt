 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international 

peace and security, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations,  

 Reaffirming that terrorism in all forms and manifestations constitutes one of 

the most serious threats to international peace and security and that any acts of 

terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivations, whenever 

and by whomsoever committed,  

 Reaffirming the need to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter 

of the United Nations and international law, including applicable international 

human rights, refugee, and humanitarian law, threats to international peace and 

security caused by terrorist acts, stressing in this regard the important role the 

United Nations plays in leading and coordinating this effort,  

 Emphasizing that sanctions are an important tool under the Charter of the 

United Nations in the maintenance and restoration of international peace and 

security including countering terrorism, and underlining the importance of prompt 

and effective implementation of relevant resolutions, in particular  Security Council 

resolutions 1267 (1999) and 1989 (2011) as key instruments in the fight against 

terrorism, 

 Recalling its Resolutions 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011), 2161 (2014), 2170 (2014), 

and 2178 (2014) and its Presidential Statements of 28 July 2014 and 19 November 

2014, including its stated intention to consider additional measures to disrupt oil 

trade by Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as Daesh), Al -Nusrah 

Front (ANF) and all other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities a ssociated 

with Al-Qaida, as a source of terrorism financing,  



S/2015/100 
 

 

15-01922 2/7 

 

 Recognizing the importance of the role that financial sanctions play in 

disrupting ISIL, ANF and all other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities 

associated with Al-Qaida, and emphasizing also the need for a comprehensive 

approach to fully disrupt ISIL and ANF that integrates multilateral strategies with 

national action by Member States, 

 Reaffirming the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the 

Republic of Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic, and reaffirming further the purposes 

and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 Reaffirming also that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any 

religion, nationality, or civilization,  

 Stressing that terrorism can only be defeated by a sustained and 

comprehensive approach involving the active participation and collaboration of all 

States, and international and regional organizations to impede, impair, isolate and 

incapacitate the terrorist threat,  

 Expressing, in this regard, its deep appreciation for Arab League Resolution 

7804 (7 September 2014), the Paris Statement (15 September 2014), the FATF 

statement on countering the financing of ISIL (24 October 2014) and the Manama 

declaration on countering terrorist finance (9 November 2014),  

 Reaffirming its resolution 1373 (2001) and in particular its decisions that all 

States shall prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts and refrain from 

providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities or persons involved in 

terrorist acts, including by suppressing recruitment of members of terrorist groups 

and eliminating the supply of weapons to terrorists,  

 Recognizing the significant need to build capacities of Member States to 

counter terrorism and terrorist finance, 

 Reiterating its deep concern that oilfields and their related infrastructure, as 

well as other infrastructure such as dams and power plants, controlled by ISIL, ANF 

and potentially other individuals, groups, undertakings and enti ties associated with 

Al-Qaida, are generating a significant portion of the groups’ income, alongside 

extortion, private foreign donations, kidnap ransoms and stolen money from the 

territory they control, which support their recruitment efforts and strengthen their 

operational capability to organize and carry out terrorist attacks,  

 Condemning in the strongest terms abductions of women and children, 

expressing outrage at their exploitation and abuse, including rape, sexual abuse, 

forced marriage, committed by ISIL, ANF, and other individuals, groups, 

undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, and encouraging all state and 

non-state actors with evidence to bring it to the attention of the Council, along with 

any information that human trafficking may support the perpetrators financially,  

 Reaffirming the obligation of Member States to freeze without delay funds and 

other financial assets or economic resources of persons who commit, or attempt to 

commit, terrorist acts or participate in or facilitate the commission of terrorist acts; 

of entities owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such persons; and of persons 

and entities acting on behalf of, or at the direction of such persons and entities, 

including funds derived or generated from property owned or controlled directly or 

indirectly by such persons and associated persons and entities,  



 
S/2015/100 

 

3/7 15-01922 

 

 Expressing its concern that economic resources such as oil, oil products, 

modular refineries and related material, other natural resources including precious 

metals such as gold, silver, and copper, diamonds, and any other assets are made 

available to ISIL, ANF, and other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities 

associated with Al-Qaida, and noting that direct or indirect trade with ISIL and ANF 

in such materials could constitute a violation of the obligations imposed by 

resolution 2161 (2014),  

 Reminding all States of their obligation to ensure that any person who 

participates in the financing, planning, preparation or perpetration of terrorist acts or 

in supporting terrorist acts is brought to justice,  

 Reaffirming its decision 2133 (2014) and noting again that ransom payments 

to terrorist groups are one of the sources of income which supports their recruitment 

efforts, strengthens their operational capability to organize and carry out terrorist 

attacks, and incentivizes future incidents of kidnapping for ransom,  

 Expressing concern at the increased use, in a globalized society, by terrorists 

and their supporters, of new information and communications technologies, in 

particular the Internet, to facilitate terrorist acts, as well as their use to incite, 

recruit, fund or plan terrorist acts,  

 Expressing grave concern at the increased incidents of kidnapping and 

hostage-murdering committed by ISIL, and condemning those heinous and cowardly 

murders which demonstrate that terrorism is a scourge impacting all of humanity 

and people from all regions and religions or belief,  

 Welcoming the report on ANF and ISIL from the Analytical Support and 

Sanctions Monitoring Team, published on 14 November 2014, and taking note of its 

recommendations,  

 Noting with concern the continued threat posed to international peace and 

security by ISIL, ANF and all other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities 

associated with Al-Qaida, and reaffirming its resolve to address all aspects of that 

threat,  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 

  Oil Trade

other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities designated as associated with  

Al-Qaida by the Committee pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999) and 1989 (2011), and

groups, undertakings and entities and may lead to further listings by the Committee;  

 2. Reaffirms that States are required by resolution 2161 (2014) to ensure 

that their nationals and those in their territory not make assets or economic 

resources, directly or indirectly, available to ISIL, ANF and all other individuals, 

groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, and notes that this 

obligation applies to the direct and indirect trade in oil and refined oil products,

indirectly, by them or by persons acting on their behalf or at their direction;  

 4. Reaffirms that States are required by resolution 2161 (2014) to ensure 

that no funds, other financial assets or economic resources are made available, 

directly or indirectly, by their nationals or by persons within their territory for the 

benefit of ISIL, ANF, and other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities 

associated with Al-Qaida;  

 5. Recalls that funds and other financial assets or economic resources made 

available to or for the benefit of listed individuals or entities are not always held 

directly by them, and recalls in addition that in identifying such funds and benefits, 

States should be alert to the possibility that property owned or controlled indirectly 

by the listed party may not be immediately visible;  

 6. Confirms that economic resources include oil, oil products, modular  

refineries and related material, other natural resources, and any other assets which

economic resources of ISIL, ANF, and other individuals, groups, undertakings  

and entities associated with Al-Qaida, including oil, oil products, modular refineries 

and related material and other natural resources owned or controlled by them, or 

persons acting on their behalf or at their direction, as well as any funds or 

negotiable benefit arising from such economic resources;

trafficking of drugs and their chemical precursors, and the importance of continued 

international cooperation to that aim;  

 9. Emphasizes that States are required to ensure that their nationals and 

persons in their territory not make available, directly or indirectly, any funds, other 

financial assets or economic resources, including oil,  oil products, modular

directed to, collected for, or otherwise for the benefit of ISIL, ANF, and other 

individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, as well as 

any funds or negotiable benefit arising from such economic resources;  

 10. Expresses concern that vehicles, including aircraft, cars and trucks and 

oil tankers, departing from or going to areas of Syria and Iraq where ISIL, ANF or 

any other groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida operate, could 

be used to transfer oil and oil products, modular refineries and related material, 

cash, and other valuable items including natural resources such as precious metals 

and minerals like gold, silver, copper and diamonds, as well as grain, livestock, 

machinery, electronics, and cigarettes by or on behalf of such entities for sale on

S/2015/100

 11. Reaffirms that all States shall ensure that any person who participates in 

the financing, planning, preparation or perpetration of terrorist acts or in supporting 

terrorist acts is brought to justice and ensure that such terrorist acts are established 

as serious criminal offenses in domestic laws and regulations and that the 

punishment duly reflects the seriousness of such terrorist acts, and emphasizes that 

such support may be provided through trade in oil and refined oil products, modular 

refineries and related material with ISIL, ANF and all other individuals, groups, 

undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida; 

 12. Decides that Member States shall inform the 1267/1989 Committee

undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, are generating income from 

engaging directly or indirectly in the looting and smuggling of cultural heritage

its potential impact on regional and international peace and security and impeding

resolutions 1267 (1999) and 1989 (2011) to update the Security Council on the
