  Draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions and statements by its President on the 
situation in Liberia and West Africa, 

 Welcoming the sustained progress made by the Government of Liberia since 
January 2006, in rebuilding Liberia for the benefit of all Liberians, with the support 
of the international community, 

 Recalling its decision not to renew the measures in paragraph 10 of resolution 
1521 (2003) regarding round log and timber products originating in Liberia, and 
stressing that Liberia’s progress in the timber sector must continue with the effective 
implementation and enforcement of the National Forestry Reform Law signed into 
law on 5 October 2006, including the resolution of land and tenure rights, 

 Welcoming the Government of Liberia’s continuing cooperation with the 
Kimberley Process Certification Scheme and noting Liberia’s progress towards 
putting in place the necessary internal controls and other requirements in order to 
satisfy the minimum requirements of the Kimberley Process, 

 Stressing the continuing importance of the United Nations Mission in Liberia 
(UNMIL) in improving security through Liberia and helping the new Government 
establish its authority throughout the country, particularly in the diamond and 
timber-producing regions, and border areas, 

 Recognizing the need for newly vetted and trained Liberian security forces to 
assume greater responsibility for national security, and taking note of the need for 
Liberian armed forces to procure humanitarian, medical and/or training equipment, 

 Taking note of the report of the United Nations Panel of Experts on Liberia 
dated 20 December 2006 (S/2006/976), including on the issues of diamonds, timber, 
rubber, and arms,  

 Having reviewed the measures imposed by paragraphs 2, 4 and 6 of resolution 
1521 (2003) and paragraph 1 of resolution 1532 (2004) and the progress towards 
meeting the conditions set out by paragraphs 5 and 7 of resolution 1521 (2003), and 
concluding that insufficient progress has been made towards that end, 

 Underlining its determination to support the Government of Liberia in its 
efforts to meet those conditions, and encouraging donors to do likewise, 



S/2006/1001  
 

06-67452 2 
 

 Determining that, despite significant progress having been made in Liberia, the 
situation there continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security in 
the region, 

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 

 1. Decides, on the basis of its assessment of progress made to date towards 
meeting the conditions for lifting the measures imposed by resolution 1521 (2003): 

 (a) To renew the measures on arms imposed by paragraph 2 of resolution 
1521 (2003) and modified by paragraphs 1 and 2 of resolution 1683 (2006) and to 
renew the measures on travel imposed by paragraph 4 of resolution 1521 (2003) for

Committee established by paragraph 21 of resolution 1521 (2003), intended solely

resolution 1521 (2003) and renewed by paragraph 4 of resolution 1689 (2006) for an

allow the Government of Liberia sufficient time to establish an effective Certificate 
of Origin regime for trade in Liberian rough diamonds that is transparent and 
internationally verifiable, with a view to joining the Kimberley Process, and calls 
upon the Government of Liberia to provide the Sanctions Committee, established 
according to paragraph 21 of resolution 1521 (2003) with a detailed description of 
the proposed regime; 

 (d) To review any of the above measures at the request of the Government of
