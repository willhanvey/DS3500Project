a result of the Syrian conflict,

about the negative impact of their presence, violent extremist ideology and actions on

of people and the unlawful destruction of cultural heritage, reaffirming its resolve to 

address all aspects of the threat posed by ISIL (also known as Daesh), ANF and all 

other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, and 

other terrorist groups, as determined by the United Nations Security Council, and as

undertakings and entities associated with ISIL or Al-Qaida, and other terrorist groups, 

as determined by the United Nations Security Council, and as may further be agreed 

by the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) and endorsed by the UN Security 

Council, 

 Reaffirming the primary responsibility of the Syrian authorities to protect the 

population in Syria and, reiterating that parties to armed conflict must take all feasible 

steps to protect civilians, and recalling in this regard its demand that all parties to 

armed conflict comply fully with the obligations applicable to them under 

international law related to the protection of civilians in armed conflict, including 

journalists, media professionals and associated personnel,  

 Strongly condemning the arbitrary detention and torture of individuals in Syria,

practices and the release of all arbitrarily detained persons starting wi th women and 

children, as well as sick, wounded and elderly people and United Nations and 

humanitarian personnel and journalists,

which those participating in humanitarian operations are increasingly exposed, as 

well as attacks on humanitarian convoys and acts of destruction and looting of their 

assets, and its urging of all parties involved in an armed conflict to promote the safety,

calling for the immediate lifting of all sieges,  

 Reiterating its grave concern at all instances of hindrances to the effective 

delivery of humanitarian assistance, noting that ISIL (also known as Daesh), ANF and 

all other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al -Qaida, are 

hindering the effective delivery of humanitarian assistance, and are responsible for 

preventing aid delivery through deliberate interference and obstruction,

 Reaffirming the need to support the United Nations and their implementing 

partners in their efforts to expand the delivery of humanitarian assistance to reach all

and their implementing partners, in accordance with UNSC Resolution 2165 (2014),

accordance with resolutions 2165 (2014), 2191 (2014), 2258 (2015) and 2332 (2016), 

and commending the mechanism’s efforts in facilitating cross-border delivery of 

humanitarian aid by the United Nations and their implementing partners, emphasizing 

the importance to further robust monitoring of the humanitarian nature of UN relief 

consignments and their delivery inside Syria, and encouraging the United Nations

possible, border crossings under resolution 2165 (2014), 

 Reiterating the need for all parties to respect and uphold the relevant provisions 

of international humanitarian law and the United Nations guiding principles of 

humanitarian emergency assistance, and emphasizing the importance of upholding the 

principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, in the provision of 

humanitarian assistance, and recalling also the importance of humanitarian deliveries 

reaching their intended beneficiaries, 

 Noting the role that ceasefire agreements which are consistent with 

humanitarian principles and international humanitarian law can play in facilitating 

the delivery of humanitarian assistance in order to help save civilian lives, and 

recalling in this regard that the Terms for the Cessation of Hostilities in Syria, 

endorsed in its resolution 2268 (2016), when implemented, have benefited the 

humanitarian situation,

 Noting the ongoing work on de-escalation areas to reduce violence as a step 

towards a comprehensive nation-wide ceasefire, and emphasizing that humanitarian 

access must be part of such efforts,  

 Expressing grave concern at the more than 5.4 million refugees, including more 

than 3.9 million women and children, who have fled Syria as a result of ongoing 

violence, and recognizing that the continued severity of the devastating humanitarian 

situation in Syria is further contributing to the movement of refugees and po ses risks 

to regional stability, 

 Reiterating its deep appreciation for the significant and admirable efforts that 

have been made by the countries of the region, notably Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq 

and Egypt, to accommodate Syrian refugees, including the  approximately 2.7 million 

refugees who have fled Syria since the adoption of resolution 2139 (2014), and 

mindful of the immense costs and social challenges incurred by these countries as a 

consequence of the crisis, 

 Noting with concern that the international response to the Syrian and regional 

crisis continues to fall short of meeting the needs as assessed by host governments 

and the United Nations, therefore urging once again all Member States, based on 

burden-sharing principles, to support the United Nations and the countries of the 

region, including by adopting medium and long-term responses to alleviate the impact 

on communities, providing increased, flexible and predictable funding as well as 

increasing resettlement efforts and humanitarian demining, and noting the Syria 

Donors Conference held in Brussels in April 2017, hosted by the European Union, 

United Kingdom, Germany, Norway, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Nations,  

 Noting with grave concern that impunity in Syria contributes to widespread 

violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian 

law, stressing the need to end impunity for these violations and abuses, and 

re-emphasizing in this regard the need that those who have committed or are otherwise 

responsible for such violations and abuses in Syria must be brought to justice,

in the absence of a political solution to the crisis,
