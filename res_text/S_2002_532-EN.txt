Bulgaria, China, France, Norway, Russian Federation,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland

The Security Council,

Recalling its previous relevant resolutions, including resolutions 986 (1995) of
14 April 1995, 1284 (1999) of 17 December 1999, 1352 (2001) of 1 June 2001,
1360 (2001) of 3 July 2001, and 1382 (2001) of 29 November 2001, as they relate to
the improvement of the humanitarian programme for Iraq,

Convinced of the need as a temporary measure to continue to provide for the
civilian needs of the Iraqi people until the fulfilment by the Government of Iraq of
the relevant resolutions, including notably resolutions 687 (1991) of 3 April 1991
and 1284 (1999), allows the Council to take further action with regard to the
prohibitions referred to in resolution 661 (1990) of 6 August 1990 in accordance
with the provisions of these resolutions,

Recalling its decision in resolution 1382 (2001) to adopt the proposed Goods
Review List and procedures for its application annexed to resolution 1382 (2001),
subject to any refinements to them agreed by the Council in light of further
consultations, for implementation beginning on 30 May 2002,

Determined to improve the humanitarian situation in Iraq,

Reaffirming the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Iraq,

Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,

1. Decides that the provisions of resolution 986 (1995), except those
contained in paragraphs 4, 11 and 12, and the provisions of paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 to
13 of resolution 1360 (2001), and subject to paragraph 15 of resolution 1284 (1999)
and the other provisions of this present resolution, shall remain in force for a new
period of 180 days beginning at 0001 hours, Eastern Daylight Time, on 30 May
2002;

2. Decides to adopt the revised Goods Review List (S/2002/515) and the
revised attached procedures for its application for implementation beginning at 0001
hours, Eastern Daylight Time, on 30 May 2002 as a basis for the humanitarian
programme in Iraq as referred to in resolution 986 (1995) and other relevant
resolutions;



2

S/2002/532

3. Authorizes States, beginning at 0001 hours, Eastern Daylight Time, on 30
May 2002, to permit, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of resolution
661 (1990) and subject to the procedures for the application of the Goods Review
List (S/2002/515), the sale or supply of any commodities or products other than
commodities or products referred to in paragraph 24 of resolution 687 (1991) as it
relates to military commodities and products, or military-related commodities or
products covered by the Goods Review List (S/2002/515) pursuant to paragraph 24
of resolution 687 (1991) whose sale or supply to Iraq has not been approved by the
Committee established pursuant to resolution 661 (1990);

4. Decides that, beginning at 0001 hours, Eastern Daylight Time, on 30 May
2002, the funds in the escrow account established pursuant to paragraph 7 of
resolution 986 (1995) may also be used to finance the sale or supply to Iraq of those
commodities or products that are authorized for sale or supply to Iraq under
paragraph 3 above, provided that the conditions of paragraph 8 (a) of resolution 986
(1995) are met;

5. Decides to conduct regularly thorough reviews of the Goods Review List
and the procedures for its implementation and to consider any necessary adjustment
and further decides that the first such review and consideration of necessary
adjustment shall be conducted prior to the end of the 180-day period established
pursuant to paragraph 1 above;

6. Decides that, for the purposes of this resolution, references in resolution
1360 (2001) to the 150-day period established by that resolution shall be interpreted
to refer to the 180-day period established pursuant to paragraph 1 above;

7. Requests that the Secretary-General and the Committee established
pursuant to resolution 661 (1990) submit at least two weeks prior to the end of the
180-day period the reports referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 of resolution 1360
(2001);

submit an assessment report on the implementation of the Goods Review List and its
procedures by the end of the next period of implementation of resolution 986 (1995)
beginning on 30 May 2002 and to include in the report recommendations on any
necessary revision of the Goods Review List and its procedures, including the
processing of contracts under paragraph 20 of resolution 687 (1991) and the utility
of the Distribution Plan as referred to in paragraph 8 (a) (ii) of resolution 986
(1995);

S/2002/532

Procedures
1 – The following procedures replace paragraphs 29 to 34 of document S/1996/636* and other existing

procedures, notably for the implementation of the relevant provisions of paragraphs 17, 18 and 25 of
resolution 1284 (1999) related to the processing of applications to be financed from the escrow account
established pursuant to paragraph 7 of resolution 986 (1995).

2 – Each application (the “Notification or Request to Ship Goods to Iraq,” as attached to these procedures,
hereafter referred to as “the application,”) for the sale or supply of commodities or products, to include
services ancillary to the supply of such commodities and products, to Iraq to be financed from the escrow
account established pursuant to paragraph 7 of resolution 986 (1995) must be forwarded to the Office of
the Iraq Programme (OIP) by the exporting States through permanent or observer Missions, or by United
Nations agencies and programmes. Each application should include complete technical specifications, as
requested in the standard application form, concluded arrangements (e.g., contracts), and other relevant
information, including, if known, whether the application contains any item(s) covered by the Goods
Review List (GRL), in order for a determination to be made on whether the application contains any item
referred to in paragraph 24 of resolution 687 (1991) as it relates to military commodities and products, or
military-related commodities or products covered by the GRL.

3 – Each application will be reviewed and registered by OIP within 10 working days. In the case of a
technically incomplete application, OIP may request additional information before transmitting the
application to the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) and
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). If OIP determines that the requested information is not
provided within 90 days, the application will be considered supplier-inactive and no further action on the
application will be taken until the information is provided. If the requested information is not received
within a further 90 days, the application will lapse. OIP should notify the submitting Mission or United
Nations agency in writing of any change in the status of the application. The OIP will identify an official
to act as a contact point on each application.

4 – After OIP registration of the application, each application will be evaluated by technical experts from
UNMOVIC and IAEA in order to determine whether the application contains any item referred to in
paragraph 24 of resolution 687 (1991) as it relates to military commodities and products, or military-
related commodities or products covered by the GRL (“GRL item(s)”). At their discretion and subject to
the approval of the 661 Committee, UNMOVIC and IAEA may issue guidance regarding what categories
of applications do not contain any item(s) covered by paragraph 24 of resolution 687 (1991) as it relates
to military commodities and products, or military-related commodities or products covered by the GRL.
UNMOVIC, IAEA and OIP, working in consultation, may develop a procedure whereby OIP may evaluate
and approve applications that, based on this guidance, fall within these categories.

5 – Military goods and services are prohibited for sale or supply to Iraq under paragraph 24 of resolution 687
(1991) and are not subject to review under the GRL. For consideration of dual-use goods and services
referred to in paragraph 24 of resolution 687 (1991), UNMOVIC and IAEA should process these goods
and services pursuant to paragraph 9 of these procedures.

6 – Upon receipt of a registered application from OIP, UNMOVIC and/or IAEA will have 10 working days to
evaluate an application as set forth in paragraphs 4 and 5. Absent action by UNMOVIC and/or IAEA
within the 10-working-day period, the application will be considered approved. In the course of
conducting the technical evaluation as set out in paragraphs 4 and 5 above, UNMOVIC and/or IAEA may
request additional information from the submitting Mission or United Nations agency. The submitting
Mission or United Nations agency should provide the additional information requested within a period of
90 days. Once UNMOVIC and/or IAEA receive the requested information, UNMOVIC and/or IAEA will
have 10 working days to evaluate the application under the procedure set forth in paragraphs 4 and 5.



4

S/2002/532

7 – If UNMOVIC and/or IAEA determine that the submitting Mission or United Nations agency has not
provided the requested additional information within the 90-day period set out in paragraph 6 above, the
application will be considered supplier-inactive and no further action on the application will be taken until
the information is provided. If the requested information is not provided within a further 90 days, the
application will lapse. OIP should notify the submitting Mission or United Nations agency in writing of
any change in the status of the application.

8 – If UNMOVIC and/or IAEA determine that the application contains any item referred to in paragraph 24 of
resolution 687 (1991) as it relates to military commodities and products, the application shall be
considered ineligible for approval for the sale or supply to Iraq. UNMOVIC and/or IAEA will provide to
the submitting Mission or United Nations agency through OIP a written explanation of this determination.

9 – If UNMOVIC and/or IAEA determine that the application contains any GRL item(s), they will
immediately inform through OIP the submitting Mission or United Nations agency. Pursuant to paragraph
11 below, absent a request by the submitting Mission or United Nations agency for reconsideration within
10 working days, OIP will forward the application containing the GRL item(s) to the 661 Committee for
the purpose of evaluating whether the GRL item(s) may be sold or supplied to Iraq. UNMOVIC and/or
IAEA will provide to the 661 Committee through OIP a written explanation of this determination. In
addition, OIP, UNMOVIC and/or IAEA, at the request of the submitting Mission or United Nations
agency, will provide to the 661 Committee an assessment of the humanitarian, economic and security
implications, of the approval or denial of the GRL item(s), including the viability of the whole contract in
which the GRL item(s) appears and the risk of diversion of the item(s) for military purposes. The
assessment provided by OIP to the Committee should be transmitted in parallel by OIP to the submitting
Mission or United Nations agency. OIP will immediately inform appropriate United Nations agents of the
finding of a GRL item(s) in the application and that the GRL item(s) may not be sold or supplied to Iraq
unless otherwise notified by OIP that the procedures set forth in paragraphs 11 or 12 have resulted in
approval for sale or supply of the GRL item(s) to Iraq. The remaining items in the application, which are
determined as not covered by the GRL, will be considered approved for sale or supply to Iraq and, at the
discretion of the submitting Mission or United Nations agency, and with the consent of the contracting
parties, will be processed according to the procedure in paragraph 10 below. The relevant approval letter
may be issued for such approved items under request from the submitting Mission or United Nations
agency.

10 – If UNMOVIC and/or IAEA determine that the application does not contain any item referred to in
paragraph 4 above, OIP will inform immediately the Government of Iraq and the submitting Mission or
United Nations agency in written form. The exporter will be eligible for payment from the escrow account
established pursuant to paragraph 7 of resolution 986 (1995) upon verification by United Nations agents
that the items in the application have arrived in Iraq as contracted. OIP and the United Nations Treasury
will inform the banks within five working days that the items in the application have arrived in Iraq.

11 – If the Mission or United Nations agency submitting an application disagrees with the determination that
an application contains an item(s) covered by paragraph 24 of resolution 687 (1991) as it relates to
military commodities and products, or military-related commodities or products covered by the GRL, it
may request a reconsideration of this decision, based on the provision of technical information and/or
explanations not previously included in the application, within 10 working days to OIP. In that event,
UNMOVIC and/or IAEA will reconsider the item(s) in accordance with the procedures set out in
paragraphs 4 to 6 above. The decision of UNMOVIC and/or IAEA will be final and no further
reconsideration will be permitted. UNMOVIC and/or IAEA will provide to the 661 Committee through
OIP a written explanation of the final decision of the reconsideration process. Applications shall not be
forwarded to the 661 Committee until the reconsideration period has expired without a request being
filed.

S/2002/532

12 – Upon receipt of an application pursuant to paragraphs 9 or 11 above, the 661 Committee will have 10
working days to determine under existing procedures whether the item(s) may be sold or supplied to Iraq.
The Committee may take a decision on an item(s) according to the following options: (a) Approval;
(b) Approval subject to conditions as stipulated by the Committee; (c) Denial; (d) Request for additional
information. Absent action by the Committee within the 10-working-day period, the application will be
considered approved. A Committee member may request additional information. If the additional
information is not provided in a 90-day period, the item(s) will be considered supplier-inactive and no
further action on the application will be taken until the information is provided. If the requested
information is not provided within a further 90 days, the application will be considered lapsed. OIP
should notify the submitting Mission or United Nations agency in writing of any change in the status of
the application. The Committee will have 20 working days to evaluate the requested additional
information once provided by the submitting Mission or United Nations agency. Absent action by the
Committee during the 20-working-day period, the item will be considered approved.

13 – Where the 661 Committee does not approve an item(s) for sale or supply to Iraq, the Committee will
notify the submitting Mission or United Nations agency with an explanation through OIP accordingly. The
submitting Mission or United Nations agency will have 30 working days to petition OIP to have the 661
Committee reconsider its decision based on new information not previously included in the application as
reviewed by the 661 Committee. A decision by the 661 Committee on a petition received during this
period shall be made within five working days and shall be considered final. Absent such a petition within
30 working days, the item will be considered ineligible for sale or supply to Iraq and OIP will notify the
submitting Mission or United Nations agency accordingly.

14 – If an item(s) is found ineligible for sale or supply to Iraq or is considered lapsed, the supplier may submit
a new application based on either a new or an amended contract, and the new application will be
evaluated under the procedures enumerated in this document and will append the original application (for
information purposes only and to facilitate review).

15 – If an item(s) is substituted for an item(s) that is either found ineligible for sale or supply to Iraq or is
considered lapsed, the new item(s) will be submitted as a new application under the procedures
enumerated in this document and will append the original application (for information purposes only and
to facilitate review).

16 – Experts from OIP, UNMOVIC and IAEA who evaluate applications should be drawn from the broadest
possible geographical base.

17 – The United Nations Secretariat will report to the 661 Committee at the end of each phase on the status of
all applications submitted during this period, including contracts recirculated pursuant to paragraph 18
below. The Secretariat will provide to members of the 661 Committee at their request copies of
applications approved by OIP, UNMOVIC and IAEA, within three working days after their approval, for
information purposes only.



6

S/2002/532

18 – OIP will divide contracts currently on hold into two categories — category A and category B. Category A
will contain contracts on hold that have been designated by UNMOVIC as containing item(s) on one or
more of the UNSCR resolution 1051 lists. Category A will also contain contracts that were both processed
before the Security Council adopted UNSCR resolution 1284 and assessed by one or more members of the
Sanctions Committee as containing item(s) on one or more of the UNSCR resolution 1051 lists. OIP will
consider contracts in category A to be “returned to the submitting Mission or United Nations agency” and
will notify the submitting Mission or United Nations agency accordingly, including national comments if
possible. The submitting Mission or United Nations agency may submit a contract in category A as a new
application under the GRL procedures. In category B will be all other contracts currently on hold.
Contracts in category B will be recirculated by OIP under the GRL procedures. OIP will append the
original committee registration number and national comments, for information purposes only, to any
recirculated contracts. OIP should start this recirculation procedure within 60 days of adoption of this
resolution and should complete the recirculation process within 60 days thereafter.
