 The Security Council,  

 Reaffirming all its previous resolutions and presidential statements concerning 

the situation in Sudan,  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, unity, independence, and 

territorial integrity of Sudan,  

 Reaffirming the primary responsibility of the Government of Sudan to protect 

civilians across its territory and recognising improvements in security conditions in 

Darfur, acknowledging in this regard the Government of Sudan’s National Plan for 

Civilian Protection (S/2020/429) and the weapons-collection programme, while 

expressing concern that the security situation in some regions of Darfur remains 

precarious, and underscoring the need to protect peacebuilding gains in Darfur, avoid 

a relapse into conflict and mitigate the risks for the population posed inter alia by 

threats against civilians in Darfur, inter-communal violence, human rights violations 

and abuses, violations of international humanitarian law and continued displacement,  

 Underscoring that it is imperative that the withdrawal of the African Union-

United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) should take into account the 

progress made in the peace process, and supporting the African Union Peace and 

Security Council’s call for extreme caution in the withdrawal of UNAMID,  

 Recognising the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on UNAMID’s drawdown, 

 Taking note of the Special Report of the Chairperson of the African Union 

Commission and the Secretary-General of the United Nations (S/2020/202),

Communiqué of 3 March 2020 (PSC/PR/COMM.(CMXIII)) and 27 May 2020

modalities and timeline for the transition of responsibility from UNAMID to the

as appropriate and in line with paragraph 5 of this resolution;  

 5. Reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to continue transition 

planning and management in accordance with the established policies, directives and 

best practices in order to ensure that the eventual transition from UNAMID to 

UNITAMS is phased, sequenced and efficient, and further reiterates its requests, in 

this regard, that UNAMID and UNITAMS establish a coordination mechanism to 

determine the modalities and timelines for the transition of responsibilities where the 

two missions have common strategic objectives and priorities in Darfur and in order 

to ensure close coordination and cooperation, information and analysis sharing, to 

maximise synergies, leverage resources and prevent the duplication of efforts;  

 6. Requests UNAMID to ensure that team sites and assets are handed over in 

line with general United Nations practices and financial regulations, taking all

particular to facilitate and support unhindered humanitarian access, including to 

internally displaced persons and refugee camps, further requests UNAMID, member 

states and the Government of Sudan to take all appropriate steps to protect the safety, 

security and health of all UNAMID personnel, in line with resolution 2518 (2020), 

including by allowing medical evacuations, while maintaining the continuity of 

operations, and to take further steps towards the provision of training for UNAMID 

personnel on issues related to preventing the spread of COVID-19;

standardize a culture of performance in United Nations peacekeeping, recalls its 

requests in resolution 2378 (2017) and resolution 2436 (2018) that the Secretary-

comprehensive and objective methodologies based on clear and well-defined

replacement or dismissal of the under-performing UNAMID uniformed or civilian 

personnel, including mission leadership and mission support personnel, consistent 

with resolution 2436 (2018), and notes the efforts of the Secretary-General to develop
