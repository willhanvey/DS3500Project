.
Taking into account that the three nuclear-weapon States which act as

depositaries of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in outer
Space and under Water 3/ undertook in that Treaty, almost 20 years ago, to seek the
achievement of the discontinuance of all test explosions of nuclear weapons for all
time and that such an undertaking was explicitly reiterated in 1968 in the Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, i(

Deploring that neither the Committee on Disarmament nor the twelfth special
session of the General Assembly have been able to elaborate a comprehensive
test-ban treaty,

1. Reiterates>onceagain'its-grave'concern'that nuclear-weapon testing
continues unabated against the wishes of the overwhelming majority of Member States;

2. Reaffirms-its-conviction that a treaty" to achieve the prohibition of all
nuclear-test explosions by all States for all time is a matter of the highest
priority and constitutes a vital element for the success of efforts to prevent both
vertical and horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons and a contribution to
nuclear disarmament)

3. Urges all States that have not yet done so to adhere without further
delay to the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space
and under Water and, meanwhile, to refrain from testing in the environments covered
by that Treaty;

4. Urges'also the three original parties to the Treaty Banning Nuclear
Weapons Tests in the Atmosphere, in OUter Space and under Water to abide strictly
by the undertakings contained therein to seek "to achieve the discontinuance of all
test explosions of nuclear weapons for all time- and "to continue negotiations to
this end" 1
