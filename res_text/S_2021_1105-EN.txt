 Recognizing the need to improve the collection, handling, preservation and 

sharing of information and materials collected or received by the military, also 

referred to as battlefield evidence, consistent with international law, to ensure that 

FTFs who have committed crimes may be investigated and, where appropriate, 

prosecuted, emphasizing that the collection and preservation of evidence, as provided 

for in respective domestic legal frameworks, are essential to the prosecution, 

adjudication and sentencing of terrorist crimes, further emphasizing the value of 

“battlefield evidence” as an essential tool for prosecutions and for determining the 

appropriate punishment for terrorist crimes, when properly obtained and used, as part 

of the effort to hold terrorists accountable for their crimes, further emphasizing the 

need to educate and train relevant practitioners on the procedures applicable to

persons, as well as money-laundering, and the trafficking in cultural property, and 

emphasizing the need to enhance coordination of efforts at the local, national, 

subregional, regional, and international levels to respond to this serious challenge, in 

accordance with international law, and in the context of criminal justice and law 

enforcement systems with full respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, and 

the rule of law,  

 Stressing the need to effectively counter the ways that ISIL, Al-Qaida, and 

associated individuals, groups, undertakings and entities use their narratives to incite 

and recruit others to commit terrorist acts, and further recalling in this regard 

resolution 2354 (2017) and the “Comprehensive International Framework to Counter 

Terrorist Narratives” (S/2017/375) with recommended guidelines and good practices,  

 Reiterating the obligation of Member States to prevent and suppress the 

financing of terrorist acts, and criminalize the willful provision or collection, by any 

means, directly or indirectly, of funds by their nationals or in their territories with the 

intention that the funds should be used, or in the knowledge that they are to be used, 

in order to carry out terrorist acts, and reaffirming also the obligation of Member 

States to freeze without delay funds and other financial assets or economic resources 

of persons or entities who commit, or attempt to commit terrorist acts or participate 

in or facilitate the commission of terrorist acts, and reaffirming further the obligation 

of Member States to prohibit their nationals or any persons and entities within their 

territories from making any funds, financial assets or economic resources or financial 

or other related services available, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of terrorist 

organizations or individual terrorists for any purpose, including but not limited to 

recruitment, training, or travel, even in the absence of a link to a specific terrorist act, 

of entities owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by such persons and of persons 

and entities acting on behalf of or at the direction of such persons,  

 Recognizing that innovations in financial technologies, products and services 

may offer significant economic opportunities but also present a risk of being misused, 

including for terrorist financing,  

 Acknowledging the important work on countering the financing of terrorism of 

United Nations entities and other multilateral bodies and forums, reiterating the

case,  

 Condemning the destruction of cultural heritage by terrorist groups, whether 

such destruction is incidental or deliberate, and reemphasizing that the unlawful 

destruction of cultural heritage, and the looting and smuggling of cultural property by 

terrorist groups, and the attempt to deny historical roots and cultural diversity in this 

context can fuel and exacerbate conflict and hamper post-conflict national

 Underscoring the importance of a whole-of-government approach and 

recognizes the important role civil society organizations can play, including in the 

health, social welfare and education sectors in contributing to the rehabilitation and 

reintegration of FTFs and their associated family members, as civil society
