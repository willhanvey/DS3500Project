 The General Assembly,

1

continued Israeli military occupation, 

 Recalling Security Council resolution 497 (1981) of 17 December 1981,  

 Recalling also its previous relevant resolutions, the most recent of which was

 Recalling its previous relevant resolutions in which, inter alia, it called upon 

Israel to put an end to its occupation of the Arab territories,

 Reaffirming that the acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible under 

international law, including the Charter of the United Nations,  

 Reaffirming also the applicability of the Geneva Convention relative to the 

Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949,
3
 to the occupied 

Syrian Golan, 

 Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 237 (1967) of 14 June 1967,  

 Welcoming the convening at Madrid of the Peace Conference on the Middle 

East on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 

and 338 (1973) of 22 October 1973 aimed at the realization of a just, comprehensive 

and lasting peace, and expressing grave concern about the stalling of the peace 

process on all tracks, 

 1. Calls upon Israel, the occupying Power, to comply with the relevant 

resolutions on the occupied Syrian Golan, in particular Security Council resolution 

497 (1981), in which the Council, inter alia, decided that the Israeli decision to 

impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan was 

null and void and without international legal effect and demanded that Israel, the 

occupying Power, rescind forthwith its decision;  

 2. Also calls upon Israel to desist from changing the physical character, 

demographic composition, institutional structure and legal status of the occupied 

Syrian Golan and in particular to desist from the establishment of settlements;  

 3. Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions 

taken or to be taken by Israel, the occupying Power, that purport to alter the 

character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void, constitute 

a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to 

the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949,
3
 and have no 

legal effect; 

 4. Calls upon Israel to desist from imposing Israeli citizenship and Israeli 

identity cards on the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan, and from its 

repressive measures against the population of the occupied Syrian Golan;  

 5. Deplores the violations by Israel of the Geneva Convention relative to 

the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949;  

 6. Calls once again upon Member States not to recognize any of the 

legislative or administrative measures and actions referred to above;  

 7. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its 

seventy-third session on the implementation of the present resolution.
