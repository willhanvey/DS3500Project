Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 8 March 2002
(S/2002/245),

observer levels authorized by its resolution 1320 (2000) until 15 September 2002;

2. Expresses its satisfaction and anticipation that a final legal settlement of
the border issues is about to be reached in accordance with the Algiers Agreements,
and welcomes in this regard recent statements by both parties reaffirming that the
upcoming border delimitation determination (hereafter referred to as “the decision”)
by the Boundary Commission is final and binding,

3. Commends the parties on the progress made thus far in implementing the
Algiers Agreements, including the continued observance of the Temporary Security
Zone (TSZ) and the steps taken in cooperation with the United Nations Cartographer
to prepare for the implementation of the decision by the Boundary Commission once
it is announced;

4. Calls on the parties to cooperate fully and expeditiously with UNMEE in
the further implementation of its mandate, to abide scrupulously by the letter and
spirit of their agreements and to engage closely with the Special Representative of
the Secretary-General regarding the implementation of the decision by the Boundary
Commission, including expeditiously engaging with UNMEE on their plans for the
demining necessary for demarcation;

5. Emphasizes the importance of ensuring expeditious implementation of
the upcoming decision by the Boundary Commission while maintaining stability in
all areas affected by the decision, and encourages the parties to consider further
practical ways and means of conducting implementation-related consultations,
possibly through appropriate strengthening of the Military Coordination
Commission and/or other arrangement with the support of the guarantors, facilitators
and witnesses of the Algiers Agreements;

6. Further emphasizes that in accordance with article 14 of the Agreement
on Cessation of Hostilities, the security arrangements are to remain in effect, and
that, accordingly, arrangements for the separation of forces, as achieved by the TSZ,
will continue to be of key importance;

7. Emphasizes that any transfer of territory and civil authority, as well as
population movements and movements of troops, pursuant to the decision by the
Boundary Commission, should take place in an orderly manner through dialogue
and modalities facilitated by the United Nations, in accordance with article 4.16 of
the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, and without any unilateral actions;

8. Further emphasizes that until the border demarcation has been
completed, UNMEE will continue to discharge its mandate;

9. Emphasizes its resolve to support the parties in the implementation of the
decision by the Boundary Commission and invites the Secretary-General to submit,
as soon as possible, recommendations to the Council on how UNMEE can play an
appropriate role in the border demarcation process, including with regard to
demining for demarcation, taking into account the decision by the Boundary
Commission, the contributions by the parties, the capacity of UNMEE and the
resources available in the United Nations Trust Fund in support of the Delimitation
and Demarcation of the Border between Ethiopia and Eritrea;

10. Calls again on Eritrea, notwithstanding the prior notification procedure,
to provide UNMEE with full freedom of movement to monitor the redeployed

General;

11. Urges Ethiopia to provide the United Nations Mine Action Coordination
Centre with clarifications to the information already put forward, as promised in this
regard;

12. Expresses its concern that there has been no progress regarding the

of the Secretary-General in a spirit of compromise to settle the issue for the mutual
benefit of all;

13. Calls on the parties to release and return without further delay all
remaining prisoners of war and civilian internees under the auspices of the ICRC in
accordance with the Geneva Conventions and the Algiers Agreements;

14. Further calls on the parties to take other measures that will build
confidence and promote reconciliation between the two peoples for their mutual
benefit, including by affording humane treatment to each other’s nationals in
accordance with the Algiers Agreements; facilitating sustainable reintegration of
refugees, internally displaced persons and demobilized soldiers; promoting cross-
border contacts at the local level aimed at resolving disputes and rebuilding
community relations; and by facilitating further dialogue among civil society at all
levels in the two countries, such as that recently undertaken by the religious leaders;

15. Encourages the parties to make arrangements enabling UNMEE to
disseminate information to relevant population groups in the mission area about the
delimitation and demarcation of the border between the two countries and the role of
the United Nations in this regard;

development of their economies and on improving their relations, for the benefit of
all the people and with the view to promoting regional peace and security;

17. Encourages the guarantors, facilitators and witnesses of the Algiers
Agreements to provide their continued support for the peace process and invites all
States and international organizations to support the process, including by exercising
the highest degree of responsibility in discouraging arms flows to the region and
through providing contributions to the Trust Fund to Support the Peace Process in
Ethiopia and Eritrea, the Trust Fund for the Delimitation and Demarcation of the
Border between Ethiopia and Eritrea and to the United Nations Consolidated
