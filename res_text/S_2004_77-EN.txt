Draft resolution

The Security Council,

Recalling all its relevant resolutions, in particular resolution 1494 (2003) of 30
July 2003,

Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 14 January 2004
(S/2004/26),

Recalling the conclusions of the Lisbon (S/1997/57, annex) and Istanbul
summits of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
regarding the situation in Abkhazia, Georgia,

Recalling the relevant principles contained in the Convention on the Safety of
United Nations and Associated Personnel adopted on 9 December 1994,

Deploring that the perpetrators of the shooting down of a helicopter of the
United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) on 8 October 2001, which
resulted in the death of nine people on board, have still not been identified,

Stressing that the continued lack of progress on key issues of a comprehensive
settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia, is unacceptable,

Welcoming, however, the positive momentum given to the United-Nations-led
peace process by regular high level meetings of the Group of Friends in Geneva and
the Georgian-Russian summit meeting in March 2003,

Noting the holding of presidential elections in Georgia in January and
encouraging the new Georgian leadership as well as the Abkhaz side to pursue a
comprehensive, peaceful political settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia,

Welcoming the important contributions made by UNOMIG and the Collective
Peacekeeping Forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS
peacekeeping force) in stabilizing the situation in the zone of conflict, and stressing
its attachment to the close cooperation existing between them in the performance of
their respective mandates,

1. Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General of 14 January 2004
(S/2004/26);

2. Reaffirms the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally



2

S/2004/77

recognized borders, and the necessity to define the status of Abkhazia within the
State of Georgia in strict accordance with these principles;

3. Commends and strongly supports the sustained efforts of the Secretary-
General and his Special Representative, with the assistance of the Russian
Federation in its capacity as facilitator as well as of the Group of Friends of the
Secretary-General and of the OSCE, to promote the stabilization of the situation and
the achievement of a comprehensive political settlement, which must include a
settlement of the political status of Abkhazia within the State of Georgia;

4. Stresses, in particular, its strong support for the document on “Basic
Principles for the Distribution of Competences between Tbilisi and Sukhumi” and
for its letter of transmittal, finalized by, and with the full support of, all members of
the Group of Friends;

5. Deeply regrets, the continued refusal of the Abkhaz side to agree to a
discussion on the substance of this document, again strongly urges the Abkhaz side
to receive the document and its transmittal letter, urges both parties thereafter to
give them full and open consideration, and to engage in constructive negotiations on
their substance, and urges those having influence with the parties to promote this
outcome;

6. Regrets the lack of progress on the initiation of political status
negotiations, and recalls, once again, that the purpose of these documents is to
facilitate meaningful negotiations between the parties, under the leadership of the
United Nations, on the status of Abkhazia within the State of Georgia, and is not an
attempt to impose or dictate any specific solution to the parties;

7. Underlines further that the process of negotiation leading to a lasting
political settlement acceptable to both sides will require concessions from both
sides;

8. Welcomes the convening of regular meetings of senior representatives of
the Group of Friends in Geneva and the intention expressed by the parties to accept
the invitation to participate in the forthcoming meeting and calls upon them to
participate again in a positive spirit;

9. Urges the parties to participate in a more active, regular and structured
manner in the task forces established in the first Geneva meeting (to address issues
in the priority areas of economic cooperation, the return of internally displaced
persons and refugees, and political and security matters) and complemented by the
working groups established in Sochi, and stresses that results oriented activities in
these three priority areas remain key to building common ground between the
Georgian and Abkhaz sides and ultimately for concluding meaningful negotiations
on a comprehensive political settlement based on the paper entitled “Basic
Principles for the Distribution of Competences between Tbilisi and Sukhumi” and
its transmittal letter;

10. Welcomes the joint Georgian-Abkhaz high level visit to Bosnia and
Herzegovina and to Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro, led by the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General, as agreed in the second Geneva meeting;

mistrust;

S/2004/77

12. Calls again on the parties to ensure the necessary revitalization of the
peace process in all its major aspects, including their work in the Coordinating
Council and its relevant mechanisms, to build on the results of the Yalta meeting on
confidence-building measures in March 2001 (S/2001/242), to implement the
proposals agreed on that occasion in a purposeful and cooperative manner, and to
consider holding a fourth conference on confidence-building measures;

13. Reminds all concerned to refrain from any action that might impede the
peace process;

14. Stresses the urgent need for progress on the question of the refugees and
internally displaced persons, calls on both sides to display a genuine commitment to
make returns the focus of special attention and to undertake this task in close
coordination with UNOMIG and consultations with UNHCR and the Group of
Friends and recalls the understanding in the Sochi summit that the reopening of the
Sochi-Tbilisi railway will be undertaken in parallel with the return of refugees and
displaced persons, starting in the Gali district;

15. Reaffirms the unacceptability of the demographic changes resulting from
the conflict, reaffirms also the inalienable right of all refugees and IDPs affected by

accordance with international law and as set out in the Quadripartite Agreement of 4
April 1994 (S/1994/397, annex II) and the Yalta Declaration;

16. Recalls that the Abkhaz side bears a particular responsibility to protect

sustainable return and looks forward to the publication of the resulting report;

18. Welcomes the positive consideration by the parties given to the
recommendations of the joint assessment mission to the Gali district, urges them

functioning;

19. Welcomes the start of the deployment of a civilian police component as
part of UNOMIG, as endorsed in resolution 1494 (2003) and agreed by the parties,

the Gali district of the remaining police officers can proceed, and calls on the parties
to cooperate and actively support the police component;

involving the local population and to address the lack of instruction in their mother
tongue for the ethnic Georgian population;

21. Calls on both parties further to publicly dissociate themselves from any

14 May 1994 on a Ceasefire and Separation of Forces (S/1994/583, annex I);

situation in the valley and calls on the sides to continue to fully implement this
protocol;

each other to improve security in the Gali sector;

appropriate security and to ensure the freedom of movement of UNOMIG, the CIS
