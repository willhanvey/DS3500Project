Annex 
 

  Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Ending Inequalities and 

Getting on Track to End AIDS by 2030 
 

 

 1. In order to get the world on track to end AIDS as a public health threat by 

2030 and accelerate progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, 

in particular Goal 3 on good health and well-being, we, Heads of State and 

Government and representatives of States and Governments assembled at the United 

Nations from 8 to 10 June 2021:  

 (a) Regret that over 75 million people have become infected with HIV and 

over 32 million people have died from AIDS-related illnesses since the start of the 

global AIDS epidemic;  

 (b) Express deep concern and regret that the international community did not 

meet the 2020 targets set out in the 2016 political declaration on HIV and AIDS, 1 

despite the fact that we have the knowledge and tools to prevent every new HIV 

infection and each AIDS-related death; 

 (c) Commit to urgent and transformative action to end the social, economic, 

racial and gender inequalities, restrictive and discriminatory laws, policies and 

practices, stigma and multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, including 

based on HIV status, and human rights violations that perpetuate the global AIDS 

epidemic; 

 (d) Strongly commit to provide greater leadership and to work together 

through international cooperation, reinvigorated multilateralism and meaningful 

community engagement to urgently accelerate our national, regional and global 

collective actions towards comprehensive prevention, treatment, care and support, 

increase investments in research, development, science and innovations to build a 

healthier world for all, and leverage the decade of action and delivery for sustainable 

development and ensure that no one is left behind, with an endeavour to reach the 

furthest behind first;  

 (e) Commit to build back better in a more equitable and inclusive manner from 

the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and its impact on the global AIDS 

epidemic and build resilience against future pandemics and other global health and 

development challenges, and continue to leverage the investments and experience of 

the HIV response to further enhance public health and strengthen health systems;  

 (f) Commit to urgent action over the next five years through a coordinated 

global HIV response based on global solidarity and shared responsibility to fully 

implement the commitments contained in the present declaration, and urgently work 

towards an HIV vaccine and a cure, recognizing that achieving the commitments will 

reduce annual new HIV infections to under 370,000 and annual AIDS-related deaths 

to under 250,000 by 2025 and generate progress towards the elimination of all forms 

of HIV-related stigma and discrimination.  

 

  The end of AIDS is within reach, but urgent action is needed  
 

 To this end we: 

 Reaffirming international resolve

 9. Reaffirm the commitment to sexual and reproductive health and 

reproductive rights, in accordance with the Programme of Action of the I nternational 

Conference on Population and Development, the Beijing Declaration and Platform 

for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences,  and reaffirm the 

right of every human being to the highest attainable standard of physical and men tal 

health, including sexual and reproductive health;  

 10. Reaffirm the sovereign rights of Member States, as enshrined in the 

Charter of the United Nations, and the need for all countries to implement the 

commitments and pledges in the present declaration consistent with national laws, 

national development priorities and international human rights;  

 11. Emphasize the important role of cultural, family, ethical and religious 

factors, including the key role played by religious leaders in the prevention of t he 

global AIDS epidemic and in treatment, care and support;  

 12. Recognize that ending AIDS requires ending all inequalities and driving 

multisectoral action across a range of Sustainable Development Goals and targets, 

and that the HIV response is making a vital contribution to the achievement of the 

2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development;  

 13. Also recognize that poverty and poor health are inextricably linked and 

that poverty can increase the risk of progression from HIV to AIDS owing to a lack 

of access to comprehensive treatment-related services and adequate nutrition and care 

services and to the inability to meet costs related to treatment services, including 

transportation;  

 14. Note that 2021 marks 40 years since the first cases of AIDS were reported, 

25 years since the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS commenced its 

work as a unique multi-stakeholder and multisectoral programme to lead the efforts 

of the United Nations system against the global AIDS epidemic and 20 years since 

the landmark 2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS and the decision to 

establish the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria;  

 

  Progress and gaps 
 

 15. Express deep concern that the global AIDS epidemic continues to affect 

every region of the world, remaining a global emergency and a paramount health, 

development, human rights and social challenge;  

 16. Recognize that, while AIDS is a global epidemic, with 38 million people 

globally living with HIV, national and regional epidemics have differen t 

characteristics and drivers and that, based on different epidemiological contexts, 

differentiated responses and interventions are required for addressing them;  

 17. Welcome and encourage regional efforts to set ambitious targets and 

design and implement strategies on HIV and AIDS;  

 18. Reiterate with profound concern that, while Africa, in particular sub-

Saharan Africa, is the region that has demonstrated the most substantial progress, it 

remains the worst-affected region and that urgent and exceptional action is required 

at all levels to curb the devastating effects of the epidemic, particularly on women, 

adolescent girls and children;  

 19. Express deep concern that in 2019 HIV and AIDS affected every region of 

the world, welcome recent reductions in HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths 

achieved in Asia and the Pacific, the Caribbean, Western and Central Europe and 

North America, and note with concern that despite progress, the Caribbean continues 

to have the highest prevalence outside sub-Saharan Africa, while the number of new 

HIV infections is increasing in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and 



 
A/75/L.95 

 

5/19 21-07241 

 

the Middle East and North Africa, and note that 90 per cent of people newly infected 

with HIV live in just 41 countries;  

 20. Welcome the progress achieved since the 2001 Declaration, including a 

54 per cent reduction in AIDS-related deaths and a 37 per cent reduction in HIV 

infections globally, including a 68 per cent reduction in vertical transmission of HIV, 

while noting with concern that overall progress has dangerously slowed since 2016;  

 21. Express deep concern that insufficient progress has been made in reducing 

HIV infections, with 1.7 million new infections in 2019 compared to the 2020 global 

target of fewer than 500,000 infections, and that new HIV infections have increased 

in at least 33 countries since 2016;  

 22. Note with concern that inequalities across multiple forms and dimensions, 

whilst different in different national contexts, can include those based on HIV status, 

gender, race, ethnicity, disability, age, income level, education, occupation, 

geographic disparities, migratory status and incarceration and these often overlap to 

compound each other, and have contributed to the failure to reach the 2020 global 

HIV targets; 

 23. Note with alarm that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing 

inequalities, created additional setbacks and pushed the AIDS response, especially 

access to medicines, treatments and diagnostics, further off track, widening fault lines 

within a deeply unequal world and exposing the dangers of under-investment in public 

health, health systems and other essential public services for all and pandemic 

preparedness;  

 24. Welcome recent efforts by countries to put in place societal enablers, 

including enabling laws, policies, public education campaigns and anti-stigma 

training for health-care workers and law enforcement that dispel the stigma and 

discrimination that still surrounds HIV, empower women and girls to take charge of 

their sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, in accordance with the 

Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and 

Development, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the outcome 

documents of their review conferences, and end the marginalization of people living 

with and at higher risk of HIV infection;  

 25. Note that each country should define the specific populations that are 

central to their epidemic and response, based on the local epidemiological context 

and note with concern that global epidemiological evidence demonstrates that key 

populations are more likely to be exposed to HIV or to transmit it, and that these 

include people living with HIV, men who have sex with men who are at 26 times 

higher risk of HIV acquisition, people who inject drugs who are at 29 times higher 

risk of HIV acquisition, female sex workers who are at 30 times higher risk of HIV 

acquisition, transgender people who are at 13 times higher risk of HIV acquisition, 

and people in prisons and other closed settings who have six times higher HIV 

prevalence than the general population, and further note with concern that these 

populations and their sexual partners account for 62 per cent of new HIV infections 

globally and for 98 per cent in Asia and the Pacific, 60 per cent in the Caribbean, 99 

per cent in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, 28 per cent in Eastern and Southern 

Africa, 77 per cent in Latin America, 97 per cent in the Middle East and North Africa, 

69 per cent in Western and Central Africa and 96 per cent in Western and Central 

Europe and North America; 

 26. Note that, depending on the epidemiological and social context of a 

particular country, other populations may be at elevated risk of HIV, including women 

and adolescent girls and their male partners, young people, children, persons with 

disabilities, ethnic and racial minorities, indigenous peoples, local communities, 



A/75/L.95 
 

 

21-07241 6/19 

 

people living in poverty, migrants, refugees, internally displaced persons, men and 

women in uniform and people in humanitarian emergencies and conflict and post-

conflict situations; 

 27. Express concern that, in sub-Saharan Africa, five out of six new infections 

among adolescents aged 15–19 years are among girls, that adolescent girls and young 

women (15–24 years) account for 24 per cent of HIV infections despite representing 

10 per cent of the population, and that AIDS is the leading cause of death for 

adolescent girls and women aged between 15 and 49 years;  

 28. Express deep concern about stigma, discrimination, violence and 

restrictive and discriminatory laws and practices that target people living with, at risk 

of and affected by HIV – including for non-disclosure, exposure and transmission of 

HIV – and laws that restrict the movement or access to services for people living with, 

at risk of and affected by HIV, including key populations, young people, women and 

girls in diverse situations and conditions, and in this regard, deplore acts of violence 

and discrimination in all regions of the world against them;  

 29. Recognize that sexual and gender-based violence, including intimate 

partner violence, the unequal socioeconomic status of women, structural barriers to 

women’s economic empowerment and insufficient protection of the sexual and 

reproductive health and reproductive rights, in accordance with the Programme of 

Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the Beijing 

Declaration and Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review 

conferences, of women and girls compromise their ability to protect themselves from 

HIV infection and aggravate the impact of AIDS;  

 30. Note with grave concern that the holistic needs and human rights of people 

living with, at risk of and affected by HIV, and of women and young people, remain 

insufficiently addressed because of inadequate integration of health services, 

including sexual and reproductive health-care services and HIV services, including 

for people who have experienced sexual or gender-based violence, including post-

exposure prophylaxis, legal services and social protection; 

 31. Note with concern that men generally have poorer outcomes than women 

across the HIV testing and treatment cascade;  

 32. Note with concern that globally HIV continues to disproportionately 

impact young people and that young people’s knowledge and awareness of HIV and 

AIDS and access to and use of essential HIV-related services remain unacceptably 

low, that condom use is on the decline and that young people, who represent 16 per 

cent of the global population, account for 28 per cent of new HIV infections, while 

stressing the need to create an environment that does not allow the dissemination of 

scientifically inaccurate information about HIV, including HIV denialism;  

 33. Note with alarm that 150,000 children were vertically infected with HIV 

in 2019 compared to the 2020 target of 20,000, while 850,000 children living with 

HIV were not on treatment, in part because of the lack of early infant diagnosis 

coverage and lack of testing options for older children who acquire HIV during 

breastfeeding,  and thus that 47 per cent of children living with HIV globally – two-

thirds of whom are 5 years old or older – do not have access to life-saving treatment, 

especially in developing countries, as a result of similar social and structural barriers 

as the adult population faces, as well as age-specific barriers, including low rates of 

diagnosis, inadequate case-finding of children outside of vertical transmission 

prevention settings, poor linkage of children to treatment and limited number and 

inadequate availability of efficacious antiretroviral child-friendly formulations, in 

certain countries and regions, stigma and discrimination, and lack of adequate social 

protection for children and caregivers;  



 
A/75/L.95 

 

7/19 21-07241 

 

 34. Note that, thanks to the increased access to antiretroviral therapy, a rising 

number of people are living longer with HIV, but note with concern that older persons 

living with HIV may face particular challenges, such as stigma and discrimination in 

health-care settings, treatment access and maintenance, and greater risk of non-

communicable diseases and other comorbidities, including mental health conditions;   

 35. Underscore the critical role of science and technology, including 

biomedical and clinical science, social and behavioural science and political and  

economic science, and evidence-based approaches in shaping the direction of and 

accelerating the HIV response;  

 36. Underscore that combination HIV prevention is a cornerstone of an 

effective HIV response and includes the following evidence-based interventions 

dependent on national and regional epidemic characteristics: male and female 

condoms and lubricant, treatment as prevention, pre-exposure prophylaxis, 

post-exposure prophylaxis, voluntary medical male circumcision, harm reduction, 15 

in accordance with national legislation, comprehensive information and education, 

including in and out of school, screening and treatment of sexually transmitted 

infections, quality secondary education, economic empowerment, sexual and 

reproductive health, reducing risk-taking behaviour and encouraging safer sexual 

behaviour, including correct and consistent use of condoms, prevention of sexual and 

gender-based violence, poverty reduction and food security, and blood safety, and in 

this regard note with alarm the limited scale of combination prevention programmes;  

 37. Note with concern that the majority of countries and regions have not made 

significant progress in expanding harm reduction programmes, in accordance with 

national legislation, as well as antiretroviral therapy and other relevant interventions 

that prevent the transmission of HIV, viral hepatitis and other blood -borne diseases 

associated with drug use, particularly those who inject drugs, and call urgent attention 

to the insufficient coverage of programmes and substance use treatment programmes 

that improve adherence to HIV drug treatment services, the marginalization of and 

discrimination against people who use drugs, particularly those who inject drugs, 

through the application of restrictive laws, which hamper access to HIV-related 

services, and in that regard, ensure access to and use of the full range of such 

interventions, including in prevention, treatment and outreach services, prisons and 

other closed settings, and promoting in that regard the use, as appropriate, of the 

technical guidance issued by the World Health Organization, the United Nations 

Office on Drugs and Crime and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, 

and note with concern that gender-based and age-based stigma and discrimination 

often act as additional barriers for women and for young people who use drugs, 

particularly those who inject drugs, to access and use these services;  

 38. Commend progress achieved in research, development and proven 

efficacy of innovative HIV interventions, including advances in treatment as 

prevention, pre-exposure prophylaxis, long-acting antiretrovirals for prevention and 

treatment, antiretroviral-based microbicides and other female-initiated options to 

reduce the risk of HIV infections, such as vaginal rings, and ongoing initiatives to

 15  A comprehensive package for the prevention, treatment and care of HIV among intravenous drug 

users should include the following nine interventions: (i) needle and syringe pr ogrammes; 

(ii) opioid substitution therapy and other drug dependence treatment; (iii) HIV testing and 

counselling; (iv) antiretroviral therapy; (v) prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted 

infections; (vi) condom programmes for intravenous drug users and their sexual partners; 

(vii) targeted information, education and communication for intravenous drug users and their 

sexual partners; (viii) vaccination, diagnosis and treatment of viral hepatitis; and (ix) prevention, 

diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis. 



A/75/L.95 
 

 

21-07241 8/19 

 

define and address the threat of antimicrobial resistance in relation to HIV and 

associated diseases, comorbidities and coinfections, especially tuberculosis;  

 39. Welcome the recent scientific evidence related to the preventative benefits 

of antiretroviral drug therapy, demonstrating no evidence of sexual transmission of 

HIV within adult couples when the HIV-positive partner is on effective and sustained 

treatment, with undetectable viral loads, confirmed by routine testing at intervals as 

recommended by the World Health Organization and reflected in its updated 2021 

guidelines, which is known as “Undetectable = Untransmittable (U = U)”, also 

recognizing the continued need for further research;  

 40. Commend the progress achieved in several regions of the world as a result 

of implementing research which has led to massive and rapid scaling-up of pre-

exposure prophylaxis and the use of post-exposure prophylaxis, in conjunction with 

treatment as prevention, resulting in the rapid reductions in the number of new HIV 

infections;  

 41. Welcome that over 26 million people living with HIV are on antiretroviral 

therapy – a number that has more than tripled since 2010 – but note that, despite this 

progress, 12 million people living with HIV still do not have access to treatment, 

especially in Africa, and that these 12 million people are prevented from accessing 

treatment owing to inequalities, multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and 

structural barriers; 

 42. Reaffirm that access to safe, effective, equitable and affordable medicines 

and commodities for all, without discrimination, is fundamental to the full realization 

of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physi cal 

and mental health, yet note with grave concern the high number of people without 

access to medicine and that the sustainability of providing lifelong safe, effective and 

affordable HIV treatment continues to be threatened by factors such as poverty and  

underscore that access to medicines would save millions of lives;  

 43. Note that tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death among people 

living with HIV and that less than half of tuberculosis cases among people living with 

HIV are diagnosed and treated appropriately, and notes the necessity to increase 

financing for research and development of new tools for tuberculosis prevention, 

diagnosis and treatment, including for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, for people 

living with HIV, as well as in the context of COVID-19;  

 44. Note that viral hepatitis coinfection with HIV, including mortality due to 

viral hepatitis coinfection, is reported across populations at higher risk of HIV, 

especially among people who inject drugs;  

 45. Note that people living with HIV are at substantially higher risk for many 

types of cancer, including those caused by the human papillomavirus, that women 

living with HIV are about six times more likely to develop cervical cancer and that 

anal cancer rates are substantially higher for men and women living with HIV than 

their HIV-negative peers;  

 46. Recognize that the HIV response has transformed global health responses, 

strengthened health systems and contributed to socioeconomic development in many 

countries;  

 47. Recognize the resilience and innovation demonstrated by communities 

during the COVID-19 pandemic in reaching affected people with safe, affordable and 

effective services, including COVID-19 testing and vaccination, HIV prevention, 

testing and treatment and other health and social services;  

 48. Welcome that HIV-related investments in leadership, expertise, research 

and development, community responses, large cadres of community health workers, 



 
A/75/L.95 

 

9/19 21-07241 

 

enhanced health information and laboratory systems and strengthened procur ement 

and supply chain management systems now play important roles in the response to 

the COVID-19 pandemic, including the development of COVID-19 vaccines;  

 49. Note that, while international investment in the COVID-19 response has 

been unprecedented but nonetheless inadequate, many national responses to COVID-19 

have demonstrated the potential and urgency for greater investment in pandemic 

responses, underscoring the imperative of increasing investments for public health 

systems, including responses to HIV and other diseases moving forward; 

 50. Welcome the steady increase in domestic HIV investment and note the 

importance of public policies, finance and capacity-building to spur even greater 

domestic resource mobilization, including through public-private partnerships and 

innovative financing mechanisms, and for enhanced revenue administration through 

modernized, progressive tax systems, improved tax policy and more efficient tax 

collection;  

 51. Express concern over the stagnation and decline in international resources 

for the HIV response, reaffirm the importance of international public finance as a 

complement to domestic resources, reiterate that the fulfilment of all official
