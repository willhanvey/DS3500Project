Noting the statement by the President of the forty-fifth regular session of the
General Conference of the Agency, that:

“During the Conference, widespread condolences were expressed to the
victims and their families as well as to the Government of the United States of
America for the terrorist acts that took place on 11 September 2001 in New
York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania. The delegates were unequivocal in
their condemnation of these terrorists acts. As called for in General Assembly
resolution 56/1 and Security Council resolution 1368 (2001), the urgent need
to work together to bring to justice the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of
these terrorist attacks and to hold accountable those responsible for aiding,
