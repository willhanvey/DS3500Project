  Moratorium on the use of the death penalty 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Guided by the purposes and principles contained in the Charter of the United 
Nations,  

 Recalling the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights2 and the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child,3 

 Reaffirming its resolutions 62/149 and 63/168 on the question of a moratorium 
on the use of the death penalty, in which the General Assembly called upon States

that still maintain the death penalty to establish a moratorium on executions with a 
view to abolishing it,  

 Mindful that any miscarriage or failure of justice in the implementation of the 
death penalty is irreversible and irreparable,  

 Convinced that a moratorium on the use of the death penalty contributes to 
respect for human dignity and to the enhancement and progressive development of 
human rights, and considering that there is no conclusive evidence of the deterrent 
value of the death penalty, 

 Noting ongoing national debates and regional initiatives on the death penalty, 
as well as the readiness of an increasing number of Member States to make 
information available on the use of the death penalty,  

 Noting also the technical cooperation among Member States in relation to 
moratoriums on the death penalty,  

 1. Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of 
resolution 63/1684 and the recommendations contained therein; 

 2. Also welcomes the steps taken by some countries to reduce the number of 
offences for which the death penalty can be imposed and the decisions made by an 
increasing number of States to apply a moratorium on executions, followed in many 
cases by the abolition of the death penalty; 

 3. Calls upon all States: 

 (a) To respect international standards that provide safeguards guaranteeing 
protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, in particular the minimum 
standards, as set out in the annex to Economic and Social Council resolution 
1984/50 of 25 May 1984, as well as to provide the Secretary-General with 
information in this regard;  

 (b) To make available relevant information with regard to their use of the 
death penalty, which can contribute to possible informed and transparent national 
debates;  

 (c) To progressively restrict the use of the death penalty and reduce the 
number of offences for which it may be imposed; 

 (d) To establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the 
death penalty;  

 4. Calls upon States which have abolished the death penalty not to 
reintroduce it, and encourages them to share their experience in this regard;  

 5. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its 
sixty-seventh session on the implementation of the present resolution;  

 6. Decides to continue consideration of the matter at its sixty-seventh 
session under the item entitled “Promotion and protection of human rights”.
