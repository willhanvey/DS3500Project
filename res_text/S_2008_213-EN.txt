political independence of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as all States 
in the region, 

 Reiterating its serious concern regarding the presence of armed groups and 
militias in the Eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly in 
the provinces of North and South Kivu and the Ituri district, which perpetuate a 
climate of insecurity in the whole region, 

 Stressing the primary responsibility of the Government of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo for ensuring security in its territory and protecting its 
civilians with respect for the rule of law, human rights and international 
humanitarian law, 

 Recalling the joint communiqué of the Government of the Democratic 
Republic of Congo and the Government of the Republic of Rwanda signed in 
Nairobi on 9 November 2007 and the outcome of the Conference for Peace, Security

2008, which together represent a major step towards the restoration of lasting peace 
and stability in the Great Lakes region, and looking forward to their full 
implementation, 

 Recalling its resolution 1804 (2008) and its demand that the Rwandan armed 
groups operating in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo lay down their 
arms without any further delay or preconditions,

of disarming, demobilizing, repatriating, resettling and reintegrating, as appropriate, 
Congolese and foreign armed groups for the long-term stabilization of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and welcoming in this regard the round table on 
the reform of the security sector that was held on 24 and 25 February 2008 in
