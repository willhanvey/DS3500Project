 The Security Council,

 Regretting the continued lack of progress on key issues of a comprehensive 
settlement of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict, 

 Acknowledging with concern the observation of the Secretary-General that a 
new and tense situation has emerged between the Georgian and the Abkhaz sides, in 
particular as a result of the Georgian special operation in the upper Kodori Valley, 

 1. Reaffirms the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty, 
independence and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally 
recognized borders, and supports all efforts by the United Nations and the Group of 
Friends of the Secretary-General which are guided by their determination to 
promote a settlement of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict only by peaceful means and 
within the framework of the Security Council resolutions; 

 2. Recalls, with a view to achieving a lasting and comprehensive settlement, 
its support for the principles contained in the “Paper on Basic Principles for the

additional ideas that the sides would be willing to offer with a view to conducting 
creatively and constructively a political dialogue under the aegis of the United 
Nations; 

 3. Having in mind the relevant Security Council resolutions containing an 
appeal to both sides to refrain from any action that might impede the peace process, 
expresses its concern with regard to the actions of the Georgian side in the Kodori 
Valley in July 2006, and to all violations of the Moscow agreement on ceasefire and

separation of forces of 14 May 1994, and other Georgian-Abkhaz agreements

Valley is in line with the Moscow agreement and that no troops unauthorized by this

in the Kodori Valley; 

 7. Acknowledges the important role of the CIS peacekeeping force and of 
UNOMIG in the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict zone, stresses the importance of close 
and effective cooperation between UNOMIG and the CIS peacekeeping force as

continue to extend the necessary cooperation to them and recalls that a lasting and 
comprehensive settlement of the conflict will require appropriate security 
guarantees;

refrain from militant rhetoric and provocative actions, especially in upper Kodori 
Valley;

return of IDPs and refugees, including their security and human rights concerns,

residency rights and identity will be respected, and move without delay on 
implementing past commitments relating to United Nations police advisers, a United 
Nations human rights sub-office and the language of instruction; 

 10. Urges both parties to finalize without delay the package of documents on 
the non-use of violence and on the return of refugees and internally displaced 
persons for the Gali district and to undertake necessary steps to secure the 
protection and dignity of the civilian population including the returnees; 

 11. Commends the presentation by both sides of ideas as a basis for dialogue 
and calls on the two sides to resume this dialogue by using all existing mechanisms 
as described in the relevant Security Council resolutions in order to come to a 
peaceful settlement;

including, security conditions permitting, the rehabilitation of infrastructure, and 
welcomes the intention expressed by Germany to host a meeting on economic 
cooperation and confidence-building measures, pending progress in the conflict 
resolution process; 

 15. Underlines that it is the primary responsibility of both sides to provide 
appropriate security and to ensure the freedom of movement of UNOMIG, the CIS 
peacekeeping force and other international personnel and calls on both sides to fulfil 
their obligations in this regard; 

 16. Welcomes the efforts being undertaken by UNOMIG to implement the 
Secretary-General’s zero tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and to 
ensure full compliance of its personnel with the United Nations code of conduct, 
requests the Secretary-General to continue to take all necessary action in this regard 
and to keep the Security Council informed, and urges troop-contributing countries to 
take appropriate preventive action including the conduct of predeployment
