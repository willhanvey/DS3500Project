  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan:  
revised draft resolution 
 
 

  Establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 52/38 S of 9 December 1997, 53/77 A of 4 December 
1998 and 55/33 W of 20 November 2000, 57/69 of 22 November 2002, and its 
decisions 54/417 of 1 December 1999, 56/412 of 29 November 2001, 58/518 of 
8 December 2003, 59/513 of 3 December 2004 and 60/516 of 8 December 2005, 

 Convinced that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones contributes to 
the achievement of general and complete disarmament, and emphasizing the 
importance of internationally recognized treaties on the establishment of such zones 
in different regions of the world in the strengthening of the non-proliferation 
regime, 

 Considering that the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central 
Asia on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region1 
constitutes an important step towards strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation 
regime, promoting cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and in the 
environmental rehabilitation of territories affected by radioactive contamination, 
and enhancing regional and international peace and security,  

 Considering also the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central 
Asia as an effective contribution to combating international terrorism and 
preventing nuclear materials and technologies from falling into the hands of non-
State actors, primarily terrorists, 

 Reaffirming the universally recognized role of the United Nations in the 
establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones,
