A/C.4/58/L.19/Rev.1

Recalling the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government
Arrangements of 13 September 19932 and the subsequent implementation
agreements between the Palestinian and Israeli sides,

Welcoming the presentation by the Quartet to the parties of the road map to a
permanent two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,3 and noting its call
for a freeze on all settlement activity,

Aware that Israeli settlement activities have involved, inter alia, the transfer of
nationals of the occupying Power into the occupied territories, the confiscation of
land, the exploitation of natural resources and other illegal actions against the
Palestinian civilian population,

Bearing in mind the detrimental impact of Israeli settlement policies, decisions
and activities on efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East,

Expressing grave concern about the continuation by Israel of settlement
activities in violation of international humanitarian law, relevant United Nations
resolutions and the agreements reached between the parties, including the
construction and expansion of the settlements in Jabal Abu-Ghneim and Ras Al-
Amud in and around Occupied East Jerusalem,

Expressing grave concern also about the construction by Israel of an unlawful
wall inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East
Jerusalem, and expressing its concern in particular about the route of the wall in
departure from the Armistice Line of 1949, which could prejudge future
negotiations and make the two-State solution physically impossible to implement
and would cause further humanitarian hardship to the Palestinian people,

Reiterating its opposition to settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian
Territory, including East Jerusalem, and to any activities involving the confiscation
of land, the disruption of the livelihood of protected persons and the de facto
annexation of land,

Recalling the need to end all acts of violence, including acts of terror,
provocation, incitement and destruction,

Gravely concerned about the dangerous situation resulting from actions taken
by the illegal armed Israeli settlers in the occupied territory, as illustrated in the
recent period,

Taking note of the relevant reports of the Secretary-General,

1. Reaffirms that Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territory, including
East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan are illegal and an obstacle to
peace and economic and social development;

2. Calls upon Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the Geneva
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of
12 August 1949,1 to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem,
and to the occupied Syrian Golan and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the
Convention, in particular article 49;

3. Reiterates its demand for the complete cessation of all Israeli settlement
activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the
occupied Syrian Golan;

4. Demands that Israel stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, which is a
departure from the Armistice Line of 1949 and is in contradiction to relevant
provisions of international law;

5. Stresses the need for full implementation of Security Council resolution
904 (1994), in which, among other things, the Council called upon Israel, the
occupying Power, to continue to take and implement measures, including
confiscation of arms, with the aim of preventing illegal acts of violence by Israeli
settlers, and called for measures to be taken to guarantee the safety and protection of
the Palestinian civilians in the occupied territory;

6. Reiterates its calls for the prevention of all acts of violence by Israeli
settlers, particularly in the light of recent developments;

7. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its
fifty-ninth session on the implementation of the present resolution.
