(A/AC.l09/L.1682), the Special Committee decided, inter alio, to take up the
quest.ion of holding a sedes of meetings away from Headqu::..:ters as appropriate and
to refer it to ita Working Group for consideration and recommendations.

61. Having regard to its l'rogramme of work f;or 1990 .. the Special Committee, at its
1360t.h meeting, on 18 August, considered the question of holding meetings away from
Headquarters, taking into account the provisions of parAgraph 6 of General Assembly
resolution 1854 (XVI) of 27 November l'J61 and paraqraph 3 (9) of resolut.ion
2021 (XXV) of 12 October 1970, by Which the General ~ssemb1y authorized the
Committee to meet el.ewhere than at United Nations Headquarters whenever and
wherever such meetings might be required for the effective discharge of its
funct.ions. Also at its 1380th meeti~g, by approving the recommendations contained
in the 95th report of its Working Group (A/AC.109/L.1713 and Corr.l), the Committeo
decided, inter aliA, to include in the appropriate section of its report to the
General Assembly a statement to the effect that it might consider accepting,
subject to the availability of the requisite conference services and facilities,
such invitations as might be received in that connection in 1990, and that, when
particulars of such meetinqs became known, it would request the Secretary-General
to see~ the necessary budgetary provision in Accordance wil~ ~stabllshed procedure.

4. Pattern of Qonferences

62. At its 1346th meeting, on 9 FebrUAry, by adopting the suggestions put forward
by the Chairman relating to the organization of the Committee's work
(A/AC.I09/L.1682), the Special 'Committee decided, !Dt~r alia, to take up as
appropriate an item entitled "Pattern of conferences" and to refer it to its
Working Group for consi~eratlon and recommendations. In so doing, the Committee
was conscious of the fact that it had initiated some important measures in
rationalizing its working methods, many of which were subsequently incorporated in
a number of resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly. Further recalling
the measures it had taken heretofore in that connection, the Committee 4ecided to
continue to eKercise its initiatives in the effective utilization of the limited
conference resources and the further reduction of its documentation requirements.

63. During the year, the Committee also continued the practice of circulating
communications and information material, as far as possible, in the form of
informal notes and aide-memoire in the original language of submission, thus
curtailing documentation requirements by some 4,000 pages and accruing considerable
savings for the Organization. A list of the official documents issued by the
Committee during 1989 is contained in the annex to the present chapter.

64. At its 1360th meeting, on 18 August, the Special Committee considered the item
on the basis of the recommendations contained in the 95th report of the Working
Group (A/AC.109/L.1713 and Corr.l). The relevant paragraphs of that repul"t read as
follows.

"10. The Workinq Group noted that during the year the Special Committee had
closely followed the guidelines set forth in the resolutions of the General
Assembly on the pattern of conferences, in particular resolution 43/222 of

control of the United Nations. Further, the Committee reaffirmed its support for
the efforts being deployed by the Security Council and the Secretary-General in
order to create and maintain the necessary conditions for a genuinely free and fair
process of self-determination in Namibia. In reaffirming that Namibia was the
legal and direct responsibility of the United Nations until genuine
self-determination and national independence were achieved, the Committee urged the
Security Council to continue to follow developments in Namibia very closely in
order to ensure the full implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)
in its original and definitive form. In emphasizing the necessity of continuing to
monitor closely the decolonization process in the Territory through the full
implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), the Committee decided to
send to Namibia a visiting mission to monitor closely the decolonization process,
in particular to observe the preparations as well as the elections in
November 1989, and requested that visiting mission to submit to the Special
Committee a report on its visit to the Territory. The Committee, cognizant of the
need for all-round support to the Namibian people, especially during the transition
and the formative stages of independence, urged Members of the United Nations and
members of specialized agencies and other organizations associated with the United
Nations to provide economic and financial assistance to the Namibian people, both
during the transitional period and after independence. The Committee requested the
Secretary-General to undertake the necessary consultations and arrangements for the
dispatch of that mission.

Assembly at its forty-fourth session (see chap. 11 of the present report). In so
doing, the Committee was guided by its conviction that the occasion provided an
appropriate opportunity to evaluate the progress achieved during the past 30 years
in the implementation of the Declaration, as well as the role played by the United
Nations and its system of organizations in that regard, and to formulate specific
measures for the elimination of the remaining vestiges of colonialism in all its
forms and manifestations in various areas of the world. The suggested programme
set out a series of specific activities to mark the occasion at the international,
regional and national levels.

117. As regards the decolonization of other Territories, the majority of which are
island Territories scattered over a wide span of oceans, the Committee reiterated
its conviction that questions of territorial size, geographical isolation or
limited resources did not in any way affect the inalienable right of the
inhabitants of those Territories to self-determination and independence in
accordance with the Declaration. The Committee reiterated also that it was the
responsibility of the administering Powers to create such conditions in those
Territories as would enable their peoples to exercise freely and without
interference their inalienable right to self-determination and independence in
accordance with the Declaration. The Committee reaffirmed that it was ultimately
for the people of those Territories themselves to determine their future pOlitical
status in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and the
Declaration. In that connection, the Committee also reaffirmed the importance of
fostering an awareness among the peoples of the possibilities open to them in the

~Bd Frano. did Dot participate in the related work of the Committee during th~

.eouring adequate, first-hand information on the politiaal, economic and social
conditions prevaili~g i~ th~ colonial Territories, as well as on the views and
a.pirationl of their inhabitants, stressed the need to continue to dispatch
viliting milsions to thOle Territories in order to faoilitate the speedy and
effective implementation of the Declaration. The Committee called upon the
administering Powers to cooperate or continue to cooperate with the United Nations
in that connection.

119. On tbe question of the imp~ementation of the neclaration by the speoialized
agencies and the international institutions associated with the tJnited Nations, the
Specla1 Committee noted the assistanoe extended thus far to colonial Territori~s
and considered that such assistance should be expanded further, comm~nsurate with
t.he pressing needs of the peoples concerned for external assistance, and reaffirmed
the responsibility of the speoialized agenoies and other organir.ations of the
United Nations system to take all the necessary measures, '~ithin their respective
spheres of oompetenoe, to ensure the full and speedy implemvntation of all relevant
United Nations resolutions. The Speeial Committee, conscious of the continuing
oritiedl need of the reop1e of Namibia, requested the organizations of the United
Nations system to ren~er concrete assistance to the people of Namibia, in
partioular during the period of transition to and immediately after independence.
The Committee requested the organizations of the United Notions system to continue
to take all necessary measures to withhold any financial, economic, technical or
ot.her assistanoe from the Government of South Africa and to refrain from taking any
action that might imply support for, or endorsement of, the repressive policy and
praotice of apartheid pursued by the racist regime against the people of South
Africa and its policy of destabilization against the neighbouring African States.
The Committee reiterated that the organizations conaerned should initiate or
broaden oontacts and oooperation with the colonial peoples and the administering
Powers concerned t.o int9nsify programmeR of assistance and urged the executive
heads of those organizations to submit to their governing and legislative organs
oonorete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant United Nations
decisions, partiCUlarly specifi~ programmes of assistance to the peoples of the
oolonial Territories and their national liberation movements. The Committee also
urged the executive heads of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to
introduce flexible prooedures to prepare specific programrn9s for the peoples of the
colouial Territories. Further, the Committee urged organizations of the United
Nations system to extend substantial material assistance to the Governments of the
front-line States in order to enable them to resist the destabilizBtion being
perpetrated by the racist regime of South Africa.

120. As concerns activities of foreign economic and other interests impeding the
Imp1ementatl~n of the Declara~ion on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples in colonial Territories, the Committee reaffirmed that any
economic or other activity that impeded the implementation of the Declaration and
obstructed efforts aimed at the elimination of colonialism, apartheid and racial
discrimination in southern Africa and other colonial Territories was in d~rect

was again enhanced during the yea~ as a rdsult of the continued cooperation
••t.nded to it by the Goveraent(1 of New Zealand, Portugal and the United States as
adminl.ter1ng Powers, in accordance with established procedure. The United Kingdom
~Bd Frano. did Dot participate in the related work of the Committee during th~
year. ~. Commltt~e hoped that th~ tw~ Government~ would reconsid~r their position
in that regard.

118. In the same oontext, the Special Committee, aware of the importance of
.eouring adequate, first-hand information on the politiaal, economic and social
conditions prevaili~g i~ th~ colonial Territories, as well as on the views and
a.pirationl of their inhabitants, stressed the need to continue to dispatch
viliting milsions to thOle Territories in order to faoilitate the speedy and
effective implementation of the Declaration. The Committee called upon the
administering Powers to cooperate or continue to cooperate with the United Nations
in that connection.

119. On tbe question of the imp~ementation of the neclaration by the speoialized
agencies and the international institutions associated with the tJnited Nations, the
Specla1 Committee noted the assistanoe extended thus far to colonial Territori~s
and considered that such assistance should be expanded further, comm~nsurate with
t.he pressing needs of the peoples concerned for external assistance, and reaffirmed
the responsibility of the speoialized agenoies and other organir.ations of the
United Nations system to take all the necessary measures, '~ithin their respective
spheres of oompetenoe, to ensure the full and speedy implemvntation of all relevant
United Nations resolutions. The Speeial Committee, conscious of the continuing

violation of the rights of the inhabitants and of the principles of the Charter and
all relevant resolutions of the United Nations. The Committee also reaffirmed the
inalienable right of the peoples of tbose Territories to self-determ'nation and
independence and to the enjoy~ment of their natural resourooa. The Committee also
reaffirmed that the activities of foreign economic. fina~Qial and other interests
operating at present in the colonial Territories c"nstit.uted IS '·~ajor "bstacle to
political independence and racial equality. The C'JmMittee condemned the policies
of Governments that continued to support or collaborate with those foreign economic
and other interests engaged in exploiting the natural and hwnan resources of the
Territories. The Committee ytrongly condemned the collaboration of certain Western
Powers, Israel and other countries with the racist minority regime of South Africa
in the nuclear field. The Committee called upon all Governments that had not yet
done so to take urgent ~ffective measuros to terminate all collaboration with the
racist regime of South Aflrica, in partl~ular in respect of their nationals and the
b~dles corporate under th~ir jurisdiction that owned and operated enterprises in
colonial Territories that were detrimental to the interests of the inhabitants of
those Territories. The Committee called upon those oil-producing and oil-exporting
countries that had not yet done so to take effective measures to terminate the
supply of crude oil and petroleum products to the racist regime of South Africa.
The Committee urged the administering Powers concerned to take effective measures
to safeguard and guarantee the inalienable right of the peoples of the colonial
Territories to their natural resources and to establish and maintain control over
the future development of those resources.

121. With respect to the military activities an~ arrangements by colonial Powero in
Territo~ies under their administration which might be impeding the implementation
of the Declaration, the Special Committee reaffirmed its strong conviction that the
presence of military bases and installations iu the colonial and Non-Self-Ooverning
Territories could constitute a major obstacle to the implementation of the
Declaration and that it was the responsibility of the administering PowerA to
onsure that the existence of such bases and installations did not hinder the
populations of the Territories from exercising their right to self-determination
and indepencence in confo~mity with the purposes and principles of the Charter and
the Declaration. Further, the Committee urged the adminiRtering Powers to continue
to take all necessary measures not to involve the Territories ooncerned in any
offensive acts or interference against other States and to comply fully with the
purposes and principles of the Charter, the Declaration and the resolutions and
decisiuns of the United Nations relating to military activities and arrangernents by
colonial Powers in Territories under their administration. The Committee once
again called upon the administering Powers concerned to terminate such activities
Bnd dismantle such military bases. The Committee reiterated that the colonial
Territories and areas adjacent thereto should not be used for nuclear te6ting,
dumping of nuclear wBstes or deployment of nuclear and other weapons of mass
destruction. The Committee co~demned the continuing support to the racist regime
of South Africa in the military and nuclear fields and expressed its concern at the
grave consequences for international peace and security of the collaboration
between the racist re9ime of South Africa and certain Western Powers, Israel and
other countries. It called upon them to end all such collaboration. The Committee
also deprecated the continued alienation of land in colonial Territories for
military installations.

lZZ. On the question of the publicity to be given to the work of the United Nations
in the field of decolonization, the Committee again stressed the need to mobilize
world public opinion in support of the peoples of colonial Territories and their

-::11-

in the field of decolonization, the Committee again stressed the need to mobilize
world public opinion in support of the peoples of colonial Territories and their

-::11-



national liberation movements in their efforts to achieve self-determination,
fre.dom and independenoe. Bearing in mind the important role being played by an
iacreasiag number of non-governmental organizations active in the field of
decolonilation, the Committee lavited those organizations to continue and intensify
their campai9n against the evils and dangere of colonialism, as well as their
support for all colonial peopleo. The Committee considered it essential that
concrete meaBures be taken to intensify the dissemination of information on
decolonization issuss - pUblicizing the activities of United Nations organs in the
field of decolonization and providing wider diss.mination of information on all
colonial Territories. The Committee requested the Department of Public Information
to intensify its information activities on decolonization, both at United Nations
Headquarters and through the effective deployment of the United Nations information
centres, and report thereon to the Committee.

123. During the year, the Special Committee aloo continued its review of the list
of Territories to which the Declaration is applicable. As regards its decision of
16 August 1988 concerning Puerto Rico, the Committee heard a number of
representatives of organizations concerned and adupted a further resolution un the
matter, which is set out in paragraph 48 of the present chapter.

124. In accordance with the guidelines established by the General Assembly, the
Special Committee was able during the year to reduce to a minimum the number of its
formal meetings and to minimize the wastage reSUlting from cancellation of
scheduled meetings.

K. Future work

125. In accordance wlth the mandate entrusted to it in the relevant General
Assembly resolutions, and subject to any further directives which it may receive
from the General Assembly during the latter's forty-fourth session, the Special
Committee intends during 1990 to pursue its efforts in seeking the best ways and
means for the immediate and full implementation of the Declaration in all
Territories that have not yet attained independence. In particular, the Committee
will keep under scrutiny developments concerning each Territory, as well as the
compliance by all States, in particular the administering Powers, with the relevant
decisions and resolutions of the United Nations. On the basis of that review, the
Committee will submit conclusions and recommendations on the specific measures
necessary to achieve the objeotives set out in the Declaration and the relevant
provisions of the Charter.

126. The Speoial Committee will continue to make concrete suggestions which could
assist the Security Council in considering appropriate measures under the Charter
with regard to developments in colonial Territories that are likely to threaten
international peace and security.

127. In view of the importance that it attaches to the thirtieth anniversary of the
adoption of the Deolaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries
and Peoples, the Special Comnlittee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption
of the suggested programme of activities as set out in chapter 11, paragraph 5, of
the present report. Subject to approval by the General Assembly at its

128. The Special Committee will continue to pay special attention to che small
Territories, whenever pospible by dispatching visiting missions to those
Territories, and to recommend to the General Assembly the most suitable steps to be
taken to enable the populations of those Territories to exercise their right to
self-determination and independence. The Committee also intends to continue its
review of the list of Territories to which the Declaration is applicable.

129. The Special Committee intends to continue its consideration of further
measures to bring an end to the activities of foreign economic and other interests
which are impeding the implementation of the Dec'aration in Namibib and in all
other Territories under colonial domination and efforts to eliminate colonialism,
apartheid and racial discrimination in southern Africa. Further, the Committee
intends to continue its study of military activities and arrangements by colonial
Powers in Territories under their administration which might be impedinq the
implementation of the Declaration.

130. The Special Committee plans to continue its consideration of the
implementation of the Declaration by the specialized agencies and the international
institutions associated with the United Nations. In so doing, the Committee will
once again review the action taken or envisaged by international organizations in
the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly. The
Committee will hold further consultations and contacts with those organizations, as
appropriate. The Committee will also be guided by the results of further
consultations, to be held in 1990, between its Chairman and the President of the
Economic and Social Council within the context of the relevant decisions of the
Assembly, the Council and the Committee itself. Further, the Committee will
maintain close contact on a regular basis with the Secretary-Oeneral of OAU and
senior members of the organization, with a view to facilitating the effective
implementation of the decisions of the various United Nations bodies by the
specialized agencies and other organizations concerned.

131. In its resolutions relating to specific Territories, the General Assembly has
repeatedly called upon the administering Powers to cooperate or continue to
cooperate with the Special Committee by permitting access of visiting missions to
the Territories under their administration. Having regard to the constructive role
played by previous United Nations visiting missions to colonial Territories, the
Committee continues to attach vital importance to the dispatching of such missions
as a means of collecting adequate and first-hand information on conditions in the
Territories and on the wishes and aspirations of the people concerning their future
status. Accordingly, the Committee will continue to seek the full cooperation of
the administering Powers in order to obtain such information through the sending,
as appropriate, of visiting missions to Territories.

132. Conscious of tho importance which the General Assembly attaches to the need
for a continuous world-wide campaign of publicity in the field of decolonization,
the Special Committee will give its continuous attention to the question of

expects to continue its review of the relevant programmes of publications and other
information activities envisaged by the Department of Public Information and the

possible dissemination of the relevant information. The Assembly will no doubt



wiSh to urge the administering Powers to cooperate with the Secretary-General in
promoting the large-scale dissemination of information in the Territories coucerned.

133. In view of the importance that it attacbes to the role of non-governmental
organizations active in the field of decolonization in Mupport of tb~ poeples of
the dependent Territories, the Special Committee will continue to seek the close
co~laboration of such organizations with a view, inter aliA, to enlisting their
support in the dissemination of the relevant information and in tbe mobilization of
world public opinion in the cause of decolonization. To tbat end, it Is the
Committee's intention also to continue to participate in conferences, sJminars and
other special me.~in9s dealing witb decolonization, arranged by those
organi8ations, as well as such meetings as may be organized by the United Nations
bodies concerned and other intergovernmental organizations.

134. In conformity witb the relevant decision of the General Assembly and in
accordance with established practice, the Special Committee will continue to
invite, as appropriate, representatives of the national liberation movements
concerned to continue to take part in the relevant proceedings. Further, whenever
necessary, the Committee will also continue to invite, in consultation, as
appropriate, with OAU and the national liberation movements concerned, individuals
wbo could furnisb it with information on specific aspects of tbe situation in the
Territory, which it might not be able to secure otherwise.

135. In the light of tbe provisions of the General Assembly resolutions concernin9
the pattern of conferences, and taking into consideration its esperience in
previous years, as well as its probable work-load for next year, tbe Special
Committee has approved a tentative programme of meetings for 1990-1991, which it
commends for approval by the Assembly. In the same connvction, as authorized by
the Assembly, the Committee intends to meot elsewhere than at United Nations
Headquarters whenever and wherever such meetings might be required for the
effective discharge of its functions. Subject to the availability of the requisite
conference services and facilities, the Committee will consider accepting such
invitations as might be received in that connection in 1990 and, when particulars
of such meetings became known, it would request the Secretary-General to seek the
necessary budgetary provision in accordance with established procedure.

136. The Special Committee suggests that, when the General Assembly examines the
question of the implementation of the Declaration at its forty-fourth session, it
may wish to take into account the various recommendations of the Committee which
are reflected in the relevant chapters of the present report and, in particular, to
endorse the proposals outlined in the present section in order to enabl~ the
Committee to carry out the tasks it envisages for 1990. In addition, the Committee
recommends that tbe Assembly should renew its appeal to the administering Powera to
take all necessary steps for the implementation of the Declaratioa and the relevant
United Nations resolutions, in accordance wit,h the freely expressed wishes of the
peoples of the Territories concorned. In this connection, the Committee recommends
that the Assembly should again request the administering P~wers to cooperate or
continue to cooperate with the Committee in the discharge of its mandate and, in
particular, to participate actively in the work relating to the Territories under
t.heir respective administrations. Bearing in mind the affirmation by the Assembly
that direct association of the Non-Self-Governing Territories in the work of the
United Nations and the specialized agencies is an effective means of promoting the
progress of the peoples of those Territories towards a position of equality with
States Members of the United Nations, the Committee also recommends that the

take all necessary steps for the implementation of the Declaratioa and the relevant
United Nations resolutions, in accordance wit,h the freely expressed wishes of the
peoples of the Territories concorned. In this connection, the Committee recommends
that the Assembly should again request the administering P~wers to cooperate or
continue to cooperate with the Committee in the discharge of its mandate and, in
particular, to participate actively in the work relating to the Territories under
t.heir respective administrations. Bearing in mind the affirmation by the Assembly
that direct association of the Non-Self-Governing Territories in the work of the
United Nations and the specialized agencies is an effective means of promoting the
progress of the peoples of those Territories towards a position of equality with
States Members of the United Nations, the Committee also recommends that the

-34-



Assembly should continue to invite the administerinCjJ Powers to allow
representatives of the Territories concerned to p~rticipate in the discussions in
the Fourth Committee and the Special Committee of the items relating to their
respective countries. Further, the Assembly miCjJht also wish to renew its appeal to
all States, the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations
system to comply with the various requests addressed to them by the Assembly and
the Security Council in their relevant resolutions.

137. The Special Committee recommeud~ that, in approving the programme of work
outlined above, the General Assembly should make adequate provision to cover the
activities the Committee ~nvlsages for 1990. In this regard, the Special Committee
recalls that in his proposed programme budget for the bienniwm 1990-1991, the
Secretary-General has included estimates in respect of the regular programme of
work of the Special Committee for 1990 and 1991 based on the level of activities
approved for the year 1989, without prejudice to the decisions to be taken by the
General Assembly at its forty-fourth and forty-fifth sessions. On that basis, the
Special Committee understands that adequate provisions would be approved by the
General Assembly. Should the Committee decide to hold a series of meetings away
from Headquarters (see para. 135) within the context of paragraph 6 of General
Assembly resolution 1654 (XVI) and paragraph 3 (9) of Assembly resolution
2621 (XXV) and when particulars of such meetings become available, it is understood
that the Secretary-General will, subject to the availability of the requisite
conference services and facilities, seek the necessary budgetary provision in
accordance wit~ establi~hed procedure. In addition, the Committee requests that
the Assembly make such financial provision as deemed appropriate to cover the
activities envisaged in connection with the commemoration in 1990 of the thirtieth
anniversary of the Declaration, as set out in chapter 11 of the present report.
Finally, the Committee expresses the hope that the Secretary-General will continue
to provide it with all the facilities and personnel necessary for the discharge of
its mandate, taking into account the various tasks assigned to it by the Assembly
as well as those arising from decisions taken by it durioCjJ the current year.

"tn 1982, the General Assembly, in line with ~~e principles embodied in
the Charter of the United Nations, namely those of equal rights and
self-determination of peoples, of respect for human rights cn~ for fundamental
freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion,
decided to expand the scope of the Week of Solidarity to include the peoples
of all other dependent Territories as well as those in South Africa fi~hting
for freedom, independence and human rights.

"The role of the United Nations in the decolonization process,
particularly since the adoption of the historic Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, was further enhanced by these
and related measures enabling the world body to attain one of its most
successful achievements.

"While it is gratifying to note that the past 30 years have witnessed
remarkable achievements in the field of decolonization, an bccomplishment of
which cur Organization can be justly proud, it is pertinent to recognize that
some 19 Territories, with a population of more than 3 million, have yet to
exercise their right to self-determination and independence.

"It is incumbent upon the Special Committee and this Organization as a
whole to ensure that none of those Territories is denied the right to
determine freely its future. The size, geographical iSOlation or limited
resources of some of those Territories should in no way be used as a pretext
to delay the implementation of the Declaration on decolonization.

"With regard to Namibia, this Week of Solidarity affords us the
opportunity to reflect further on the critical developments unfolding in the
Territory, which are crucial in determining the independence process and the
ultimate destiny of its people.

"The international community continues to follow with the utmost concern
the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) of
29 September 1978, which forms the basis for Namibia's independence. The acts
of repression and intimidation perpetrated by South African forces right from
the outset of the implementation process which resulted in heavy loss of life
of Namibians, comprising largely combatants of the South West Afrir.e People'S
Organization (SWAPO), as well as the ensuing cases of misconduct continue to
cause great consternation.

"Hence, while encouraging all positive efforts to implement the process
effectively, the international community should remain vigilant against any
design to derail the independence plan and stand resolutely behind the
implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) in its original and
definitive form.

"To this end, the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG)
should be strengthened to assume effective control and all restrictive and
discriminatory laws must be repealed without delay to ensure the security of
the Namibian people, including the returnees, in order to enable them to
participate fully in free and fair elections.

"The continued subjection of these peoples to alien dominadon anli the

13. The 273rd report of the Sub-Committee (A/AC.109/L.1685), adopted ~y the
Special Committee at its 1349th meeting, on 9 August 1989 (see para. 10), contained
the following conclusions and recommendations:

-56-



(1) The Special Committee should reiterate t.le importance of the United
Nations effecting the widest possible dissemination of tru~,accurate and
topical information on decolonization as an instrument for furthering the
purposes anJ principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples,
contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, and
for mobilizing world public opinion in support of the peoples of colonial
Territories and their national liberation movements in their efforts to
achieve self-determination, freedom and independence.

(2) The Special Committee should condemn the extensive links and
collaboration between South Africa and certain Western countries in the
political, economic, nuclear, military and other fields. The Committee should
olso strongly denounce the attempts by South ~frica, its Western and other
allies and certain mass media in some Western and other countries to
misrepresent the struggle for freedom an~ independence in southern Africa as
terrorist activities and to label the national liberation movements as
terrorist organizations. The Committee should therefore consider it
imperative for the United Nations to take all possible steps to intensify its
activities in the field of dissemination of tnformation in order to counter
suoh attempts and t.o make tho in".ernational "ommuuity and world public opinion
~.~re ~lat recognition by the United Nations of the legitimacy of the
liberation struggle by the people of southern Afrioa entails as a corollary
the extension of all moral and material support ~o them and their national
liberation movements.

(3) The Special Committee should reit~rate ~he great importance it
attaches to the work of the Department for S~~cial Political Questions,
Regional Cooperation, Decolonization and Trusteeship. It should be recalled
that the Information Unit on Decolonization in that Department vas created in
pursuance of General Assembly resolution 3164 (XXVIII) of 14 DecemUer 1973 :n
order to collect, prepare and disseminate, on a continuous basis and ir
consultation with the Special Committee and the Department o~ P'lI;,~.ic
Information, basic material, studies and articles relating to thA problems of
decolonization. The CommittP8 should urge the Depe~tment to take all
necessary steps to enable it to continue to discharge its mandate.

(4) While noting the active participation of the Department of Public
Information in the work of the Sub-Committee and its efforts to produce and
disseminate information on decolonization, to monitor the responses received
from the United Nations information centres and to report therp-~L· the Special
Committee should request the Department,

(a) To continue to intensify, through all the means at its disposal, its
work of pUblicity in the field of decolonization, basing its activities in
this regard on the Charter; on the Declaration on the Granting of Independence
to Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in General Assembly resolution
1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960; on the Plan of Action for the Full
ImplementativD of the Declaration, contained in the annex to General Assembly
resolution 35/118 of 11 December 1980; on the items on the agenda of the
Special Committee, and ~n all relevant resolutions and decisions of the

activities of the two bodies, particularly with regard to raising support for,
and its effect on, the peoples of southern Africa and their national
liberation movements in their struggle for freedom, self-determination,
independence and human rights. Among the matters to be considered in the

tho United Nations Fund for Nanlibia, the United Nations Educational and
Training Programme for Southern Africa and the United Nations Trust Fund for

B. Decision of the Special Committee

9. The text of the con~ensus (A/AC.109/l011) adopted by the Special Committee at
its 1354th meetin9, on 15 AU9ust 1989, to which reference is made in para9raph 7,
is reproduced belowl

1. The Special Committee, having considered the item entitled "t..ilitRry
activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under th~ir
administration which mi9ht be impeding the implementation of the Declaration
on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples" and
recalling its decision of 8 August 1988 on the itpr,i, 11 deplores the fact that
the colonial Powers concerned have taken no steps to implement the request
that the General Assembly has repeatedly addressed to them, most recently in
paragraph 10 of its resolution 43/45 of 22 November 1988, to withdraw
immediately and unconditionally their military bases and installations from
colonial Territories and to refrain from establishing new ones.

2. In recalling General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960
and all other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations
relating to military bases and installations in colonial and
Non-Self-Governing Territories, the Special Committee reaffirms its strong
conviction that the presence of military bases and installations in the
colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories could constitute a major obstacle
to the implementation of the Declaration and that it is the responsibility of
the administering Powers to ensure that the uxistence of such bases and
installations does not hinder the populations of the Territories from
exercising their ri9ht to self-determination and independence in conformity
with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the
Declaration. Furthermore, aware of the presence of military bases and
installations of the administering Powers concerned and other countries in
those Territories, the Committee urges the administering Powers concerned to
continue to take all necessary measures not to involve those Territories in
any offensive acts or interference against other States and to comply fully
with the purposes and principles of the ChAr~er, the Declaration and the
resolutions and decisions of the United Nations relating to military
activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their
administration.

3. The Special Committee reiter~tes its condemnation of all military
activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their
administration that are detrimental to the rights and interests of the
colonial peoples concerned, especially their right to self-determination and
independence. The Committee once again calls upon the colonial Powers

its 1354th meetin9, on 15 AU9ust 1989, to which reference is made in para9raph 7,
is reproduced belowl

1. The Special Committee, having considered the item entitled "t..ilitRry
activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under th~ir
administration which mi9ht be impeding the implementation of the Declaration
on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples" and
recalling its decision of 8 August 1988 on the itpr,i, 11 deplores the fact that
the colonial Powers concerned have taken no steps to implement the request
that the General Assembly has repeatedly addressed to them, most recently in
paragraph 10 of its resolution 43/45 of 22 November 1988, to withdraw
immediately and unconditionally their military bases and installations from
colonial Territories and to refrain from establishing new ones.

2. In recalling General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960
and all other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations
relating to military bases and installations in colonial and
Non-Self-Governing Territories, the Special Committee reaffirms its strong
conviction that the presence of military bases and installations in the
colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories could constitute a major obstacle
to the implementation of the Declaration and that it is the responsibility of
the administering Powers to ensure that the uxistence of such bases and
installations does not hinder the populations of the Territories from
exercising their ri9ht to self-determination and independence in conformity
with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the
Declaration. Furthermore, aware of the presence of military bases and
installations of the administering Powers concerned and other countries in
those Territories, the Committee urges the administering Powers concerned to
continue to take all necessary measures not to involve those Territories in
any offensive acts or interference against other States and to comply fully
with the purposes and principles of the ChAr~er, the Declaration and the
resolutions and decisions of the United Nations relating to military
activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their
administration.

3. The Special Committee reiter~tes its condemnation of all military
activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their
administration that are detrimental to the rights and interests of the
colonial peoples concerned, especially their right to self-determination and
independence. The Committee once again calls upon the colonial Powers

-79-



concerned to terminate immediately and unconditionally such activities and to
eliminate such military bases in compliance with the relevant resolutions of
the General Assembly, in particular wi~h paragraph 9 of the Plan of Action for
the Pull Implementation of the Declaration OD th~ Granting of Independence to
Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in the annex to Assembly resolution
35/118 of 11 December 1980.

4. The Sgecial Committee reiterates that the colonial Territories and areas
ad'acent thereto should not be used for nuclear testing, dumpinq of nuclear
wastes or deployment of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction.

5. The Speoial Committee notes with serious concern that, i~ southern Africa
in general, 4 critical situation continuen to prevail as a reoult of South
Africa's inhuman repression of the people of South Africa. The Committee
declares tha~ the policy of apartheid and destabili~ation pursued by Pretoria
not only underminas the peace and statility of the southern African region but
slso constitutes a threat to international peace and security.

6. The Special Commi~tee condemns the continued military, nuclear and
in~el1igenne collaboration betwe6n South Africa and certain countries, which
constitutes a violation of the arms embargo imposed against South Africa by
the Security C'.~ncil in its resolution 418 (1977) of 4 November 1977, and
which poses a threat to international peace and sect'rity. The Committee urges
that the Security Council consider, as a matter of urgency, the report of the
Committee established under it. resolution 421 (1977) of 9 December 1977 ~I
and that it adopt further measures to widen the scope of resolution 418 (1977)
in order to make it more effective and comprehensive. The Committee also
calls for the scrupulous observance of Security Council rBsolution 558 (1984)
of 13 December 1984 enjoining all States to refrain from i~· orting armaments
from South Africa. The Committde is partiCUlarly mindful ln that regard of a
series of reSOlutions adopted by the Security Cout~il, ~I the General
Assembly, the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the
Implementetion of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peo~les, the Special Committee against Apartheid and the United
Nations Council tlr Namibia, as well as the Movement ~f N~n-Aligned Countries,
the Organization of African Unity, the Commonwealth and a number of
intergovernmental and regional organizations.

7. The Special Committee reaffirms the legitimacy of the stru9g1e of the
people of Namibia to achieve their freedom and independence and appeals to all
States to render sustained assistance in all fields in suppo~t of the f~ithful
implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) of 29 September 1978.

8. The Special CommitteG considers that the acquisition of nUClear-weapon
capability hy the racist regime of South Africa, with its infamous record of
violence ud aggression, consti';utes a further effort on i~s part to terrorize
and intimldate independent States in the region into submission while alse·
posing a threat to all mankind. The Committee c~ndemns the continuing support
to the racist regime of Sou~h Africa in the military and nuclear fields. In
this context the Committee expresses its concern at the grave consequences for
interndtional peace 1~d security of the collaboration between the racist
regime of South Afr1(~ and certain Western Powers, Israel and other countries
in the military and nuclear fields. It calls upon the States concerned to end

concerned to terminate immediately and unconditionally such activities and to
eliminate such military bases in compliance with the relevant resolutions of
the General Assembly, in particular wi~h paragraph 9 of the Plan of Action for

all such collaboration and. in particular. to halt the supply to South Africa
of equipment. technology. nuclear materials and related training. which
increases it3 nuclear capability.

O. The Special Committee strongly condemns the continuing collaboration of
certain countries with the racist regime iu the political. economic. military
and nuclear fieldd and e~presses its conviction that such collaboration is in
contravention of the arms embargo imposed against South Africa under Security
Council resolution 418 (1977) and undermines international solidarity against
the apartheid regime. The Committee thus calls for the termination forthwith
of all su~h collaboration.

10. The Special Committee urges all Gover~ments. the &pecialized agencies and
other intergovernmental organizati'ons to provide increased material aSBistanc~
to the thousands of refugees who have been forced by the apartheid regime's
oppressive policies in South Africa to flee into the neighbouring States.

l~. The Special, Committee deprecates the continued alienation ot. land in
colonial Territories for military installations. The large-scale utilization
of looal economic and manpower resources for this purpose a.Lverts resources
that oould be more benefinially ~tilized in promoting the economic development
of th~ Territeries concerned and is tbus contrary to the interests of their
populations.

12. The Special Committee requests the Secretary-General to continue. through
the Department of Public Information of the Secretariat. an intensified
campaign of publicity with a view to informing world public opinion of the
facts concernin'J the military activities and arrangements in colonial
Territories which are impeding the implementation of ths Declaration on the

Assemb~y may give in this connection at its forty-fourth session, to continue
to consider the item at its next se~sion.

system should be drawn to the principle that recognition by the General Assembly,
the Security Council and other United Nations organs of the legitimacy of the
struggle of colonial peoples to exercise their right to self-determination and
independence entails, as a corollary, the increase by the United Nations system of
its moral and Material assistance to the peoples of the colonial Territories, in
particular in southern Africa, and their national liberation movements recognized
by OAU.

(6) The Sub-Committee continues to urge the specialized agencies and other
organizations and institutions of the United Nations system to render or to
cont1nue to render, as a matter of urgency, all possible moral and material
assistance to the colonial peoples struggling for their liberation, particularly in
southern Africa. In this connection, the Sub-Committee is of the opinion that all
organizations concerned should initiate, in the case of those that have not yet
done 8'), or broaden contacts and co-operation with those peoples and thei~ national
liberation movements directly or, where appropriate, through the relevant
international bodies, particularly OAU, and should work out and implement concrete
programmes of assistance for those peoples with the active co-operation of their
national liberation movements. The Sub-Committee is of the view that the
assistance provided hy the speci~lized agencies and other organizations and
institutions of the United Nations system to the peoples of the colonial
Territories and their internationally recognized national liberation movements
should not only meet their immediate needs but also create conditions conducive to
development after these peoples have exercised their right to self-determination
and independence, taking into consideration the need to preserve indigenous
cultures and traditions, as well as the benefits they may provide for development.

(7) The Sub-Committee urges the specialized agencies and other organizatiuns
and institutions of the United Nations system to assist in accelerating progress in
all sectors of the national life of the small Territories, particularly in the
development of their economies.

(8) The Sub-Committee commends the arrangements made by several specialized
agencies and other organizations and institutions Qf the United Nations system that
enable representatives of the national liberation movements recognized by OAU and
by the United Nations to participate fUlly as observers in the proceedings of these
organizations relating to matters concerning their countries and calls upon those
agencies and organizations that have not yet done so to follow this example and to
make the necessary arrangements without delay.

(9) The Sub-Committee notes with satisfaction that the Namibian people
continue to be the beneficiaries of a number of programmes established within the
framework of the United Nations Fund for Namibia and the United Nations Educational
and Training Programme for Southern Africa, an~ that the United Nations Council for
Namibia continues to ropresent the people of Nwnibia at meetings of the specialized
agencies an" other organizations and institutions of the United Nations system.

(10) The Sub-Committee emphasizes the importance of co-ordilA6tion at the

country, regional and Headquarters levels of the programmes of assistance provided
by the specialized agencies and other or~anizations and institutions of the United
Nations system to the colonial peoples and their national liberation movements,
particular ly those in southern Africa recognized by OAU. The Sub·-Committee
considers that such co-ordination would enable the peoples concerned to derive the

(11) The Sub-Committee reiterates its firm conviction that, in accordance with
the releva~t re.olutions and decisions of the General Assembly and the Security
Cou~cil, all specialized agencies and other organizations and institutions of the
United Nations sYHtem should take all the measures necessary to stop all
collaboration with or assistanco to the racist regime of South Africa in financial,
econom1c, technical, nuclear or otber f10lds so as to compel that reg1me to
implement tbe resolutions and decisions of the United Nations concerning the
apartheid regime aud neighbouring States. The Sub-Committee is also of the view
that these organizations should diDcontinue all collaboration with and support to
that regime until apartheid has been eradicated and a non-racial, united and
democra~ic State baRed on the will of all South African people has been established
in accordance with the relevant resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly
and the Security Council. The Sub-Committee commends all those agencies and
organizations that have terminated relations with the racist South African regime
and recommends that the Special Committee should request the General Assembly to
bold accountable those agencies and organizations that continue to co-operate with,
and extend such assistance to, South Africa.

(12) The Sub-Committee takes note of the statement made by the representative
of the World Bank before the Sub-Committee on 6 April 1989, in which he indicated
that South Africa was a member of the Bank but that the Bank had not granted any
lv ns to South Africa since 1966 and that all loans made to, or guaranteed by,
So~th Africa up to that time had been fully repaid. Therefore, the Bank did not
have any outstanding loans to South Africa. Also, the last election for executive
directors of the Bank Group i~ which South Africa had participated had been the one
held in 1972, as a result, it was not represented on the Board of Executive
Directors of the Bank, the International Development Association (IDA) or the
International Finance Corporation (IFC). The Sub-Committee regrets, however, that
the World Bank continues to maintain certain financial and technical links ~~th
racist South Africa, as ezemplified by the continued participation of South Africa
in the work of that body, and is of the view that the World Bank should put an end
to all links with that racist regime, as long as apartheid continues to ezist.

(13) The Sub-Committee deeply deplores the granting, in disregard of relevant
resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly, of a credit of $US 1.1 billion
by IMF to South Africa in Nov&mber 1982. The Sub-Committee takes note of the
statement made by the representative of IMF on 6 April 1989, in which he said that
South Africa had paid back to the Fund all the amounts it had borrowed, along with
interest charges. The Sub-Committee is strongly convinced that the total economic
isolation of the apartheid system implies a ser~ous instability in the South
Afri~an economy. In this connection the Su~-Committee deeply regrets that IMF
continues to maintain links with the racist South African regime, and it is of the
view that IMF should put an end to all links with that racist regime and should not
extend Bny credits or any kind of assistance to South Africa as long as apartheid
continues to exist.

(14) The Sub-Committee therefore recommends that the General Assembly, at it~
forty-fourth seasion, should once again propose, under article 111 of the A9rGe~lent
betwaen the United Nations and IMF, ~I the urgent inclusion in the agenda of the
Board of Governors of the Fund of an item dealing with the relationship between the
~Jnd and South Africa. It further recommends that, in pursuanoe of article II of
the Agreement, the General Assembly should propose that the relevant orga•..~ of the
United Nations should participate in any meeting of the Board of Governors ca~led
by the Fund for the purpose of discussing the above-mentioned item.

(16) The Sub-Committee reiterates its conviction that consultations with the
specialized agencies ar.d other organizations and institutions of the United Nations
system are an appropriate means for further strengthening the role of those
orqanizations in the process of decolonization with reqard to the aims and
objeotives of the Declaration, as well as for the Special Committee to benefit from
their experience in that process. The Sub-Committee is also of the opinion that
the agencies and organizations, particularly IMF, in accordance with their
charters, should inform it of the results of tile consideration by their respective
bodies of the appeals addressed to them in the relevant resolutions and decisions
of the General Assembly aimed at enhancing their role in the decolonization process.

I. INTRODUCTION

1. The question of Namibia has been on the agenda of the United Nations since the
very inception of the Organization. The major turning point came in 1966 with the
General Assembly's determination, subsequently affirmed by the International Court
of Justice, that South Africa's presence in Nami~ia was illegal and must be
terminated fortnwith. From that time the Unite6 Nations assumed direct
responsibility for Namibia, replacing South Africa as the Administering Authority
under international law.

2. In 1973, by resolution 3111 (XXVIII), the General Assembly recognized the
South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), which was waging the struggle for
Namibia's liberation from colonial rule, as the sole and authentic representative
of the Namibian people. SWAPO was also granted observer status at the United
Nations by the General Assembly in 1976 (resolution 31/152) and participated
actively in international meetings and conferences related to Namibia convened by
the United Nations and the specialized agencies of the United Nations system.

3. On 29 September 1978 the Security Council, by adopting resolution 435 (1978),
established an internationally accepted basis r~r Namibia's attainment of
independence. It was not until 1 April 1989, however, that the United Nations
independence plan, as embodied in Security Council reSOlution 435 (1978) and
related documents, 11 was finally put into effect.

4. As a United Nations committee established in 1961 to facilitate the full and
speedy application of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples, the Special Committee has been considering all aspects of
the Namibian question. Within the framework of the Declaration the Spe~ial
Committee has not only adopted resolutions aimed at enhancing the independence
process in the Territory but attended major international conferences and seminars
which focused on the Ndmibian question. In keeping with its mandate to secure a
presence in those Territories that are approaching independence and to observe the
final stages of the decolonization process, the Special Committee, by its
resolution of 18 August 1989 (A/AC.109/l014), decided to send a visiting mission to
Namibia to monitor closely tOe decolonization process, in particular to observe the
preparations as well as the elections in November 1989.

5. Accordingly, a mission, composed of Mr. Tesfaye Tadesse, Permanent
Representative of Ethiopia to the United Nations and Chairman of the Special
Committee, Who served as Chairman of the Mission; Mr. Martin Adouki, Permanent
Representative of the Congo to the United Nations; Mr. Bechir Gueblaoui, Ambassador
of Tunisia; Mr. Ladislav Lengyel, Ambassador of Czechoslovakia;
Mr. Gilberto Carrasquero, Ambassador of Venezuela; Mr. Mahmoud Sadat Madarshahi,
Ambassador and Deputy Permanent Representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran to
the United Nations; and Mr. Amin Rianom, Minister Counsellor of the Permanent
Mission of Indonesia, was dispatched into the Territory durinq the period
29 October to 17 November 1989.

6. The Mission was assisted by a team from the United Nations Secretariat
composed of Mr. Wilfrid De Souza, Principal Secretary; Mrs. Neuza de C. Costa,
Senior Political Affairs Officer; Miss Johanna M. Fritsche and Mr. Steven Gleason,
Political Affairs Officers; and Mrs. Susan Yango, Administrative Officer.

7. In preparing the present report the Misn~~n has set for itself two basic
tasks. The first is to record its observations on the electoral process carried
out in Namibia under the terms of Security Council res~lution 435 (1978). The
second is to suggest ways in which the remaining stages of the decolonization
process can be managed so as to lead to genuine independence for Namibia under
conditions that will offer the greatest benefit to the people of the country. In
formulating its report, the Mission has relied primarily on information derived
from extensive discussio~s with concerned parties, organizations and individuals in
Namibia, as well as first-hand observations at the polling stations and other sites
in the Territory.

11. THE ELECTORAL PROCESS

8. The basic objectives of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) arel
(a) withdrawal of South Africa's illegal administration from Namibial and
(b) transfer of power to the people of the Territory through free and fair
elections under the supervision and control of the United Nations. In accordance
with the said resolution, voters exercised their inalienable right to
self-determination by choosing their represE;ntatives to a constituent assembly that
is charged with drafting a constitution for an independent Namibia. The elections
were supervised and controlled by the United Nations Transition Assistance Group
(UNTAG).

A. Preparations for the elections

1. Bepeal of discriminatory legislation

9. By the start of voting all the major discriminatory legislation had been
repealed except for Proclamation AG 8, which provides for a system of ethnic
administration. Although Proclamation AG 8 did not prevent the holding of free and
fair elections, it was highly regrettable that a piece of legislation perpetuating
apartheid and the bantustanization of Namibia was allowed to remain intact into the
transitional period. The Mission considers that Proclamation AG 8 should be
repealed and the apparatus created by it disbanded as soon as practicable.

2. Release of political prisoners held by South Africa

10. In JUly 1989, the South African authorities released 25 political prisoners.
SWAPO claimed that at least another 60 were still in detention. The
Administrator-General replied that the persons on the lists submitted to him had
either been released or were unknown to the South African authorities.

3. Return of Namibian expatriates

11. By November 1989, despite early delays, the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had successfully repatriated over
41,000 Namibians from various parts of the world. Others returned on their own.
Among the returnees were seVeral hundl'~d persons releasad from detention by SWAPO
at its refugee settlements in Angola. Some parties and organizations claimed that
SWAPO had not released all of its detainees and was still holding many more
Namibians against their will outside Namibia.

12. The United Nations Mission on Detainees (Clark Comrni~sion), dispatched by the
Special Representative of the Secret~rv-General in September 1989, was not able to
locate any suoh detainees. 11 As of 31 October 1989, there were 263 persons on the
Clark Commission's list of alleged detainees whose present status was "unknown and
requir1llg further information". UNTAG has undert,aken to use its best efforts to
clarify all outstanding cases.

4. Cessation of hostile actA: »h~with4[awal of Sout~
African forces

13· Under the indepondence plan all persopnel of the South African Defence Forces
(SADF) but 1,500 were to be withdrawn from Namibia within 12 weeks of the start of
implementation (1 April 1989) and the remaining 1,500 confined to base. This step
was completed lln 24 J1.\..e in compliance with the plan. Those confined to base are
to be withdrawn after the certification of the election.

5. f.lV&i.obilization oi citizen fOlces. commandos and ethnic gorces

14. This wa~ one of the most difficult and contentious aspects of the preparations
for the elections. ThE:! counter-in8~rgency unit known as "I<oevoet", which had
earned a reputation for brutality in its actions against civilians in northern
Namibia, was disbanded before 1 April. However, I<oevoet was reconstituted as a
unit in early April after fighting broke out in the North in which returning SWAPO
combatants were killed by South African ~ecurity forces. By mid-May Koevoet was
again disbanded but many of its personnel were absorbed into the South West Africa
Police (SWAPOL). They \.._..... jnued to operate in the same manner as before the plan
came into effect, moving aro'lnd in armourec", personnel carriers known as "Casspirs"
mount.ed with heavy machiu8-guns. This clearly violated the independence plan,
which stipulated that police should carry only small arms. Moreover, UNTAG
received many complaints of intimidation by ex-Koevoe~ personnel integrated into
SWAPOL.

15. It was only after repeatad demand~ • , the Secretary-General of the United
Nations and sustained pressure from t~ )curity Council that the South African
Administration agreed completely to demobilize Koevoet and remove its personnel
from the police force. Although that process was completed on 30 October, there
was still cause for concern because the ex-Koevoet members continued to receive pay
from the South African Administration and thus remained in contact with their
former commanders.

16. Another alarming aspect of the demobilization exercise was that remnants jf'
the SADF command structure remained in place, ostensibly to administer SADF
personnel performing civilian functions (doctors, teac",ers, etc.) and to issue
payments to demobilized soldiers of the South West Africa Territorial Force
(SWATF). UNTAG officials acknowledged to the Mission that these arrangements gave
the appearance of being intended to facilitate a rapid remobilization of the
territorial forces. But they also pointed out that even if the arrangement were
not in place, South Africa could re-establish a coercive ,nilitary presence in
Namibia in a v~ry short period of time, should it so desire. This is a regrettable
fact which has serious implications for both the transitional and post-independence
periods.

fact which has serious implications for both the transitional and post-independence

6. Maintenance Qf law and Qrder

17. Under the independence plan the primary responsibility fQr maintaining law and
order rests with the existing pQlice forces (SWAPOL), which numbered abQut 2,500
once all the KQevQet elements were remQved. Their actiQns are Qbserved and
monitQred by a cQntingent Qf UNTAG PQlice mQnitors (CIVPOL) whose strength was
increased during the pre-electiQn periQd frQm the Qrigipal figure Qf 360 tQ 1,500.

18. During the early mQnths Qf implementation UNTAG received many complaints of
SWAPOL intimi.~atiQn Qf civilians, particularly thQse showing signs Qf suppQrt fQr
SWAPO. As time passed, however, the frequency of such complaints diminished while
cases Qf violence amQng civilian suppQrters Qf the political parties began to be
reported. The manner in which the reported acts of viQlence were perpetrated seems
to suggest the possibility of a shift of emphasis by ex-Koevoet members who could
have played the unhelpful rQle Qf viQlent political agitatQr in pQlitical rallies
and public venues even after their remQval frQm SWAPOL. AnQther factor affecting
the maintenance Qf law and order was the pQQr cQ-QperatiQn extended tQ UNTAG by
SWAPOL, particularly in the initial stages.

7. IntimidatiQn Qr interference with the electoral process

19. The independence plan requires the Special Representative to take steps to
guarantee against the possibility Qf intimidation or interference with the
electQral prQcess frQm whatever quarter. During the electoral campaign the main
instrument at the disposal Qf the Special Representative was CrVPOL. As mentiQned
above, the force was wisel7 increased tQ 1,500 in order more effectively tQ monitor
SWAPOL. AlthQugh the CIVPOL Qfficers were unarmed and were empQwered Qnly tQ
repQrt unauthQrized actiQns, there is nQ doubt that their presence, often in jQint
patrQls with SWAPOL, exercised a PQsitive restraining influence Qn the police force
and inspired a sense Qf security in the populatiQn.

B. The elections

1. General atmQsphere

20. There is nQ dQubt that citizens must enjoy civil Qrder, tranquillity and
freedQm frQm intimidatiQn Qr harassment if & free and fair election is to take
place. SQ far as the Mission CQuld determine, and viewed against a backgrQund Qf
continuQus violence which was characteristic of the TerritQry thrQughQut its
illegal QccupatiQn, a general atmosphere Qf calm prevailed throughout Namibia
during the last stage of the electQral campaign and the VQting.

21. The outbreak Qf hostilities in April 1989, in which many SWAPO combatants were
killed by SQuth African forces, cast a shadQw over the early stages Qf the
independence prQcess. ~ther incidents SUCll as the assassinatiQn in September Qf
the SWAPO Qfficial, Anton LubQwski, were alsQ cause fQr seriQus CQncern. HQwever,
these tragic events did nQt derail the independence prQcess nor create insuperable
impediments tQ a satisfactory exercise in decolonization.

form of direct harassment or disregard Qf violence directed against SWAPO
supporters by members of other parties. However, the complaints of intimidation

6. Maintenance Qf law and Qrder

17. Under the independence plan the primary responsibility fQr maintaining law and
order rests with the existing pQlice forces (SWAPOL), which numbered abQut 2,500
once all the KQevQet elements were remQved. Their actiQns are Qbserved and
monitQred by a cQntingent Qf UNTAG PQlice mQnitors (CIVPOL) whose strength was
increased during the pre-electiQn periQd frQm the Qrigipal figure Qf 360 tQ 1,500.

18. During the early mQnths Qf implementation UNTAG received many complaints of
SWAPOL intimi.~atiQn Qf civilians, particularly thQse showing signs Qf suppQrt fQr
SWAPO. As time passed, however, the frequency of such complaints diminished while
cases Qf violence amQng civilian suppQrters Qf the political parties began to be
reported. The manner in which the reported acts of viQlence were perpetrated seems
to suggest the possibility of a shift of emphasis by ex-Koevoet members who could
have played the unhelpful rQle Qf viQlent political agitatQr in pQlitical rallies
and public venues even after their remQval frQm SWAPOL. AnQther factor affecting
the maintenance Qf law and order was the pQQr cQ-QperatiQn extended tQ UNTAG by
SWAPOL, particularly in the initial stages.

7. IntimidatiQn Qr interference with the electoral process

19. The independence plan requires the Special Representative to take steps to
guarantee against the possibility Qf intimidation or interference with the
electQral prQcess frQm whatever quarter. During the electoral campaign the main
instrument at the disposal Qf the Special Representative was CrVPOL. As mentiQned
above, the force was wisel7 increased tQ 1,500 in order more effectively tQ monitor
SWAPOL. AlthQugh the CIVPOL Qfficers were unarmed and were empQwered Qnly tQ
repQrt unauthQrized actiQns, there is nQ doubt that their presence, often in jQint
patrQls with SWAPOL, exercised a PQsitive restraining influence Qn the police force

22. The Mission was aware of charges of SWAPOL bias against SWAPO, either in the
form of direct harassment or disregard Qf violence directed against SWAPO
supporters by members of other parties. However, the complaints of intimidation

-113-



were sporadic and their number diminished as the election period approached.
Likewise, the incidence of physical confrontations between supporters of different
political parties was surprisingly low considering the strong partisan sentiments
aruuled b1 the e1uctlons and the occasional proximity of political rallies held by
different pa~ties. Without a doubt, the signing of a Code of Conduct JI between
'the partiel in September 1989 and the ~eploymeut of a large force of United Nations
police monitors helped to reduce the extent of political violence.

23. In all, it was the considered view of the Mission that there was no wide-scale
violence, civil disorder or voter intimidation during the electoral process.
Conditions in the country were qenerally conducive to a free and fair vote.

2. Registration

24. All observations indicate that the reqistration of voters, carried out between
3 July and 23 September 1989, was conducted in an orderly way under close
supervision by UNTAG personnel. Over 701,000 voters were registered, with only
593 applications being rejected. An issue of concern has been the presence, among
the registrants, of approximately 10,000 persons normally resident in South Africa
who were made eligible to vote under the applicable legislation.

3. Fublic i4formatiQn

25. UNTAG and the Office of the Administrator-General used a variety of media to
inform voters about the United Nations plan and the rules governing registt'ation
and voting. Likewise, the political parties undertook the responsibility of
instructing their supporters in the correct prQcedures.

26. In the realm of political informatiQn, concern focused on the South West
Africa Brcadcastinq Corporation (SWABC), a parastatal corporation governed by
directors appointed by the Administrator-General. SWABC operates the sole radio
station and television network in Namibia. The tone and content of its broadcasts
assumed special significance in view of the corporatiQn's monQpQly in radio and
television, the high rate ot illiteracy in the country (about 60 per cent) and the
partisan character of the printed media. From the beginning of the campaign there
were complaints about the political parties' lack of access to electronic media
outlets, and also about editorial bias Qn the part of SWABC, particularly against
SWAPO.

27. After repeated representations by the Special Representative, the first
problem was resolved in mid-September when registered political parties were
granted equal access to set periods of air time on radio and television.

26. The second problem, that of underlying bias in SWABC's editorial
decision-making, proved more intransigent. Allegations of bias in the choice and
presentation of news and current events cQntinued throu9~out the campaign,
supported by three studies issued by Namibia Peace Plan'35 (NPP-435), a
non-partisan monitoring group. Finally the Governing Du~rd of SWABC, which had
been appointed prior to implementation of the United Nations plan and was thought
to be a main cause of the problem, was pronounced on 27 October to be "in recess
until further notice".

29. ThB Mission regrets that the problem of editorial impartiality was not
resolved before the elections to the satisfaction of the Special Representative.
It con~urs with the judgement of the Secretary-General that "substantial reform [of
SWABC] ls necessitated by the rapid and dynamic process of change that ls now
taking place in the Terr! tory ••• ". i.l

4. Voting and Qounting of the votes

30. On the first day of olections (7 November) the voters showed great enthusiasm,
appearing ~t the voting station, in unexpectedly high numbers and queueing up in
some cases as early as five hours before the polls opened. Because of the huge
turnout and initially slow pace of processing, long lines persisted throughout the
day at some locations. Voters endurft4 the wait patiently, often languishinq under
hot skies without drin~4Qg water. Many stations closed much later than the
appoi~ted hour of 1 p.m. Statistics provided by UNTAG indicate that 32.8 per cent
of eligible voters cast their ballot on the first day.

31. On subsequent days the voting went more smoothly as lines diminished and the
electoral officials gained experience. Throughout the week there were scattered
reports of jostling in th~ lines, voters carrying weapons, attempts at
disinformation and illegal posting of campaign materialS within the 500-metre
limit. Some voting stations ran out of ballot boxes or ballot papers and had to
suspend their operations temporarily. However, none of these problems reached
serious proportions. The voting was completed according to schedule on 11 November.

32. One form of potential intimidation witnessed by the Mission (Team B) was the
presence near polling stations in Rundu of men openly carrying weapons. These
individuals, reportedly supporters of the Democrat~ . Turnhalle Alliance (DTA), wore
T-shirts emblaloned with slogans such as "Koevoet Kavango". None the less, the
Mission has no indication that these individuals visibly deterred anyone from
voting.

33. From its many visits to polling stations throughout the Territory, the MisRion
was able to observe that voting proceeded in a smooth and orderly fashion. It
noticed especially that in general the procedures and regulations were carefully
obs0rved. At each station, four to five officials of the Administrator-GeneralIs
Office processed voters under close supervision by three to four UNTAG electoral
monitors. Polling agents assigned by the political parties also scrutinized the
process, 99 did numerous foreign observers. SWAPOL and CIVPOL officers were
stationed at the polls and maintained joint custOdy of the ballot boxes at all
times. Under these conditions the Mission believes that there was very little
potential for fraud, abuse or intimidation of voters at polling places.

34. One aspect of voting that attracted a great deal of media attention was the
arrival ~t Windhoek Airport of chartered planes bearing white voters from South
Africa (see para. 24). News reports stated that some South African voters had
attempted to "jump the-line" on 1 September and vote quickly so that they could
catch their return flight. The more extreme reports spoke of "apartheid-like"
conditions in Which black voters stood waiting while privileged whites voted first.

35" The Mission later learned that the voters from South Africa had indeed
requested epectal treatment, but when told that they must join the regular line
they had complied and no major irregUlarity had occurred.

30. At Ariammvlei, a border town near South Africa, the Mission observed a kind of
de focto s.paration betw.... groups of whit.s and blaaks at the polling station
whioh gave a 8.mblanoe of t_o separate ~ueues defined along ~aoial lines. The Team
was later informed that there was no discrimination involvea as the arrangement
witnessed was required to ~ater to the interpretation needs ~f a group of
Portuguese-sp.aking women to whom the voting procedure was being explained. The
Mislion conoluded that the arrangements at Ariamsvlei, although unusual, dld not
p,,-event anyono from voting freely.

31. The counting of the votes, begun on Monday, 13 November, proceeded rapidly and
without difficulty. The results of the election, as officially announced on
14 November 19aV, are shown in detail in appendix I to the present report. As a
re8ult of the voting, the distribution of seats in the Constituent Assembly will
bel South West Afri~a People's Organization (SWAPO), 411 Demooratic Turnhalle
Alliance (DTA), 211 United Democratic Front (UDF), 41 Action Christian National
(ACH), 31 National Patriotio Front of Namibia (NPF), 11 Federal Convention of
Namibia (FCN), 11 and Namibia National Front (NNF), 1.

C. Cpnglusions

38. Despite the baokground of repressive oolonial envirom~ent and extensive
lopsided campaigns mainly directed against SWAPO supporters, the atmosphere
prevailing in the Territory during the casting of ballots was relatively quiet and
free. There were serious incidents of violence and intimidation, but they were not
80 widespread as to disrupt the electoral campaign or to prohibit free and fair
elections.

39. The high rate of illiteracy may have limited somewhat the effectiveness of
voter education. Moreover, by moot accounts, the quality and even-handedness of
radio and television programming were not entirely satisfactory. None the less,
judging from the massive turnout, the Mission believes that most voters were as
fully informed and aware of the implications of their vote as could be expected
under the circumstances.

4U. The voting and counting of the votes proceeded without any substantial or
systematic irregUlarities. The high rate of voter turnout, axceeding 95 per cent
of those registered, demonstrated that voters attached great importance to the
elections.

41. Overall, the elections in Namibia were held in conformity with established
United Nations standards of decolonization. The people of Namibia freely chose
representatives to deter.mine their political future. It is therefore the view of
the Mission that all thoqe that contributed to the success of the process can draw
;ust~fiable satisfaction.

Ill. -rRANSFER OF POWER TO THE NAMIBIAN PEOPLE

43. The Constituent Assembly Proc~A~~tlon (No. AG 62), issued by the
Administrator-General on 6 November 1~a9 after an exchange of views with the
Special Representative on a preliminary draft, provides that the Constituent
Assembly will hold its first meeting one week ofter the certification of the
elections and elect its Cbairman by a simple majority. The Assembly will adopt a
Constitution for Namibia by a two-thirds majority of its total member8hip. It will
declare Namibia to be independent on a date determined by it and on which date the
Constitution will come into effect. The Assembly will establish, subject to the
provisions of the Constitution, a government for the independent State of Namibia.

44. One of the major concerns about the transitionsl period is whether the
Constituent Assembly will be able to complete its work within a reasonable time and
in a tranquil atmosphere.

45. It will be recalled that in July 1982, a set of "principles concerning the
Constituent Assembly and the Constitution for an independent Namibia" ~I was made a
part of the United Nations independence plan. Under the terms of Security Council
resolution 632 (1989) of 16 February 1989, the 1982 principles are binding on the
parties to the plan.

46. Since most if not all of th& political parties contesting the elections have
endorsed the 1982 principles, the representatives to the Constit~ent Assembly will
already, in a sense, have achieved consensus on some basic issues before they take
up their task. The participants will also wish to move quickly so that the
legitimate government of independent Namibia can assume power and exercise full
authority as soon as possible. The framers of the Constitution no doubt are aware
of the strong desire within the international community to see the question of
Namibia finally resolved. It is therefore to be hoped that the newly established
Assembly will discharge its responsibility in the most prompt and expeditious
manner possible.

IV. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS

47. The importance for Namibia's future of the transitional period immediately
following the elections cannot be overstated. It marks the final crucial stage of
decolonization which, if successfully completed, will culminate in the assumption
of power by a government that is truly representative of the Namibian people and
reflective of their national aspirations. In this respect the Mission would like
to highlight the most salient issues that require urgent and immediate attention.

A. Political

48. For more than a century the Namibian people have been subjected to
discrimination and COlonial domination. The South Afri~an occupation brought
apartheid and bantustanization to Namibia, creating deep divisions and social
cleavages that must now be healed quickly if the new nation is to thrive. It is
therefore up to the political parties which have won seats in the Constituent
Assembly to demonstrate their full commitment to raciel equality and national
reconciliation in Namibia.

49. At the same time, the different tendencies of legitimate political opinion
will have to contend peacefully in the framework of a continuing democratic
proc.... Here al.o the CODstituent Assembly not only provides a perfectly viable
m.chani.m to formulate a Constitution and deal with the remaining tasks of the
transition period, but also serves as a democratic forum for the advancement of
commonly hold views regarding the destiny of the new nation.

50. The Mission is pleeued to note that several parties expressed to it their
oommitment to accept the results of the elections and to form coalitions or engage
in negotiations, if 4eoessary, to oocure passago of thp Constitution. It hopos
that all of the parties genuinely share this positive attitude.

51. AI Namibia approacbe8 independence, the MiQsion also considers it extremely
important to recall Security Council resolution 432 (1978) of 27 July 1978, which
r8effirmed the territorial integrity and unity of Namibia, inclUding Walvis Bay.
The United Nations position on this question is clear and categorical. All efforts
should be continued until Walvis Bay is restored as an integral part of a united
Namibia. The United Mations has also affirmed, through Decree No. 1 for the
Protection of the Natural Resources of Namibia, ~/ the right of the Namibian r~~ple
to enjoy the economic benefits derived from exploitation of their natural
resources, including entitlement to compensation for such benefits as were unjustly
denied them.

B. Socio-economic

52. The Government of Namibia will face very serious challenges in the economic
and socIal spheres. In the short term it will have to facilitate the continuing
resettlement and relnteqration of some 40,000 returnees. Another 20,000 Namlbians,
former members of the South African security forces, will be ( _eking employment.
Not all of the 10,000 small businesses ana family enterprises that sprang up in the
North to service SADF and SWATF can survive the transition period. The
unemployment rate, officially estimated at 20 to 30 per cent but perhaps
35 per cent in reality, is thus likely to climb even higher.

53. In addition, the Government will face an immediate fiscal crisis if South
African budgetary aid, reduced from R 308 million 1/ in the previous fiscal year to
R 80 million in the current one, is cut off completely at independence as
expected. At the same time it will have to cope with the p~~t-up material
expectations of a majority disenfranchised by colonization. .4uch will be required
of it by way of improving the poor conditions in housing, health, education and
nutrition.

54. The implications of these pressures for the new government and the stability
of the neWly emerging nation are quite obvious.

55. In the 10nger term Namibia has strong economic potential due to the small
population, natural resource endowment and well-developed infrastructure in some
sectors such as transport. The colonial regime, however, has created an economic
structure that is riddled with inequities and distortions. The mining sector, by
far the largest source of export revenues, is dominated by foreign-owned companies
reluctant to reinvest their profits in other sectors of the Namibian economy. The
marine resources have been depleted by over-fishing; agriculture is limited mostly
to a few thousand large-scale, white-owned cattle ranches. There are few

-118-

49. At the same time, the different tendencies of legitimate political opinion
will have to contend peacefully in the framework of a continuing democratic
proc.... Here al.o the CODstituent Assembly not only provides a perfectly viable
m.chani.m to formulate a Constitution and deal with the remaining tasks of the
transition period, but also serves as a democratic forum for the advancement of
commonly hold views regarding the destiny of the new nation.

50. The Mission is pleeued to note that several parties expressed to it their
oommitment to accept the results of the elections and to form coalitions or engage
in negotiations, if 4eoessary, to oocure passago of thp Constitution. It hopos
that all of the parties genuinely share this positive attitude.

51. AI Namibia approacbe8 independence, the MiQsion also considers it extremely
important to recall Security Council resolution 432 (1978) of 27 July 1978, which
r8effirmed the territorial integrity and unity of Namibia, inclUding Walvis Bay.
The United Nations position on this question is clear and categorical. All efforts
should be continued until Walvis Bay is restored as an integral part of a united
Namibia. The United Mations has also affirmed, through Decree No. 1 for the
Protection of the Natural Resources of Namibia, ~/ the right of the Namibian r~~ple

marine resources have been depleted by over-fishing; agriculture is limited mostly
to a few thousand large-scale, white-owned cattle ranches. There are few

-118-



labour-intensive enterprises in either agriculture or industry. The whole system
has been geared to providing a comfortable standard of living for the wh!te
minority while the great mass of black Namibians are left with illiteracy, low
wagee, unomployment and squalid living conditions.

56. Moreover, the Namibian economy has been closely integrated with that of Sourn
Afrlca, being governed by the South African monetary system, central bank and
customs union. Namibia is highly dependent on South Af~ica for consumer imports,
including food. Aside frum beef, diamonds, uranium and base metals, the volume of
local output is low and the range very narrow. Thus the question of viability of
Namibia's economy after independence will be a question to be addressed i£ the new
nation is to be engaged in normal trade and financial relations with other
countries.

57. The key (and interrelated) determinants of Namibia's economic future will be
the eoonomic policy adopted by the new government and the extent and quality of
external assistanoe. The Mission is not in a position to anticipate W~Bt polioies
the government will adopt. It is gratified to note, however, that most of the
political parties have oxpressed their commitment to adopting an approach that can
speed the mobilization of resources, bring material benefits to all Namibians and
help the society to advance towards greater self-reliance.

58. As far as external assistance is concerned, the Mission considers the
provision of ample resources, directed at meeting the urgent requiremer.ts of the
transition period as well as longer-term development objectives, to be of paramount
importance as the country takes on the difficult task of national reconstruction
and development.

59. The United Nations system should play the leadlng role in this regard. The
Mission in this respect notes that the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
has estbblish~d a special Trust Fund for Namibia and undertaken a series of
detailed studies of Namibia's economic and social situation within the policy
issues and options that may be considered by post-independence Namibia. UNDP has
already established its presence in Windhoek and begun the work of co-ordinating
the efforts of specialized agencies of the United Nations system on behalf oZ
Namibia. It is hoped that this will enable it to monitor the situatio~s closely in
order to mobilize effectively the necessary assistance.

60. The Mission welcomes and endorses the appeal launched by the Security Council,
in resolution 643 (1989) of 31 October 1989, to Member States, United Nations
agencies, and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to eatend
generuus financial, material and technical support to the Namibian people, both
during the transitional p~,iod and after independence.

C. Security and other concerns

61. Fulfilment of the political conditions mentioned in section A above would
provide the best assurance of civil harmony and security during the transitional
period. But the Mission considers it important that due attention be give~ to
making appropriate security arrangements to ensure peace alld stability ln the
country.

62. In this respect the problem of massive firearms possession as well as the
811eged cache. of weapoD. cannot be 88fely ignored. Just before and during the
elections there were persistent reports of 8WAPOL issuing w~apons to white police
"reservists" under the pretext that its 2,500-member foroe might not be of
sufficient strength to carry out its responsibilities. The Mission was assured
that the reservists had only been called uF for the elections and would be disarmed
tbereafter. None the less, in view of the widespread ownership of arms, with over
120,000 licensed weapons and an unknown number of unlicensed arms in tbe possession
of private citizens, the issue seems to wftrrant careful oonsideration.

03. Considering the course of events during the electoral poriod, the Mission does
not believe that law and order are likely to break down during the transition to
indftpendenae. Nevertheless, it can only deplare the fact that the ownership of
weapons has been allowed to proliferate to such aD extent as would seriously
exacerbate any outbreak of civil strife. As for SWAPOL, since it is expacted to
oontinue the responsibility for malntaining law and order up to the date of
lndependence, it is crucial now more tha" ever that its members act wit~ utmost
disoipline and impartiality to keep the peace.

64. Another concern that warrants attention is the ~otal removal of kny remnants
of the old SADF/SWATF military structure. In this respect mentlon should be made
of the two "BusDen Battalions" of SWA'!'r, comprising about 1,300 soldiers who live
with their families at former SADr militory camps in eastern Namibia. These
battalions were disarmed but not dispersod like other SWATF units because it was
said that their personnel had become completely alienated from their traditional
way of life and would have no other means of livelihood if sent away from the camps.

65. During its stay in Namibia, the Mission heard about sinister plans to remove
the demobilized Bushmen soldiers and th~ir families to South Africa, which the
Mission does not consider to be appropriateo As these Bu~hmen are Namibians,
arrangements should be made both during the transition and afterwards, if need be
with the support of the international comm~nity, to resettle them within Namibia so
that they can find all alternative means of livelihood.

66. The Mission was also intrigued to hoar about the village in northern Namibia
called Delta, located about 7 kilometrec from the Angolan border. Delta is
inhabited by about 5,100 people (including children) said to be Portuguese-speaking
Angolans who fled across the boraer in 1974 to escape fighting in their own
country. According to some accounts the settlement had connections in the past
with SADF and/or possibly the Uniao Nacional para a lndependenci~ Total de Angola
(UNITA). The Mission was not able to obtain sufficient information to comment on
the situation in Delta, nor was it able to visit the village because of its
remoteness. However, it considers the matter worth looking into to determine
whether humanitarian or securitl concerns might exist as in the case of the Bushmen
Battalinns.

67. Once the old South African military structures are completely disbanded or
withdrawn, the government of independent Namibia will have to determine the nature
of its national security arrangements, including the size and structure of the
nation'S military and police forces. Tho Mission has neithpr the mandate nor the
expertise to comment on such matters. It does, howev~t, wish to express strongly
its concern that the fledgling State of Nemibia should not be exposed or feel
vulnerable to intimidation or destabilizatiQn from any quarter. To this end, it is
hoped that UNTAG, if so requested, would be prepared to extend technical assistance

to Namibia for the establishment of its national security apparatus. At the same
time, all efforts to promote peace and stability in southern Africa, through United

v. CLOSING REMARKS

68. The Namibian people, the United Nations, the Organization of African Unlty,
the Movement of NOD-Aligned Countries and the international community at large have
worked long and hard to bring Namibia to the brink of independence. For the
Namibians, especially for their courageous combatants under their liberation
movement, SWAPO, the last t~o decades in particular have been a time of intense
struggle to cast off colonialism at the cost of much suffering and many lost
lives. There have been many obstacles and stumbling-blocks. Even the United
Nations plan, which seemed in 1978 to offer the hope of imminent independence for
Namibia, was delayed for more than 10 years by South African obstruction and
intransigence. Even after the adoption of the plan, UNTAG had to face many
obstacles in its effo~ts to fulfil the implementation of Security Council
resolution 435 (1978).

69. It is absolutely imperative that after SU much time and strenuous effort this
process should now be brougllt to a s~ccessful conclusion. The internati~na1
community must take pains to ensure that in every sphere of endeavour - political,
economic, diplomatic - all energies are directed to the full decolonization and
genuine independence of united Namibia.

7~. The Mission is convinced that if all parties act wisely and in good faith,
their efforts will bring rich rewards. The people of Namibia will enjoy the
national independence for which they have struggled for so many years. The United
Nations will have acquitted honourably its responsibility for Namibia, thereby
enhancing its credibility as a global guardian of freedom and a peace-making
organization. Last but not least, southern Africa will have moved one step closer
to attaining peace and stability through the complete elimination of apartheid and
racial oppression, all of which would significantly contribute to the total
liberation of the African continent as well as to the peace and security of the
world.

VI. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

71. Upon the completion of its task, the Mission cannot but express its deep
gratitude to the Secretory-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for having made
the necessary arrangements to facilitate its timely visit to Namibia in a short
period and under difficult circumstances. The Mission is indebted to
Mr. Abdulrahim Abby Farah and the Secretary-General's Special Representative,
Mr. Martti Ahtisaari, as well as the Deputy Special Representative,
Mr. L. Joseph Legwaila; for their assistance in the discharge of its mandate. It
is appreciative of the co-operation extended to it by the senior officials of
UNTAG, particularly Mr. Abdou Ciss, Director of Administration, as well as the
UNTAG field officers.

remaining manifestations of colonialism and to report thereon to the General
Assembly at its forty-fourth session". The Committee also took into account
Assembly resolutions 43/33 to 43/44 of 22 November 1988 and decisions 43/402 of
23 September 1988 and 43/411 to 43/413 of 22 November 1988 relating to the items.
Further, the Committee took fnto account the relevant provisions of Assembly
resolution 35/118 of 11 December 1980, the annex to which contains the Plan of
Action for the Full Implementation of the Declaration, as well as Assembly
resolution 40/56 of 2 December 1985. relating to the twenty-fifth anniversary of the
Declaration.

established procedures, the delegations ~f New Zealand, Portugal and the United
States of America continued to participate in the work of the Speci~l Committee,

did not take part in the Committee's consideration of the Trust Territory of the
Pacific Islands.

5. The delegation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
the administering Power concerned, did not participate in the Special Committee's

Territory under its administration and bearing in mind the relevant provisions of
the General Assembly resolutions, particularly those that had invited all States to
co-operate fully with the Special Committee in the fulfilment of its mandate,
expressed its regret at the non-particip~tionof the United Kingdom and the
negative impact thereof on its work. In that regard, the Sub-Committee stressed
the importance of multilateral efforts within the framework of the United Nations
for the solution of the remaining problems of decolonization. It reiterated its
appeal to the administering Power to reconsider its decision and to resume its
participation in the work of the Special Committee.

contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960.

although both the Goverwnent and the Opposition parties agreed that the
Territory might~not be economically prepared for independence, the Chief
Minister had firmly stated his conviction that an independent Montserrat would
be in a better position to pursue its economic 90a1s, and he had called for
appropriate mechanisms to be put in place to educate the people of Montserrat
on the true significance and meaning of nationhood and self-determination so
that they would be in a position to hold a referendum on independence by 1990.

reads as follows (see also para. 112, draft resolution X)I

(1) The Special Committee reaffirms the inalienable right of the people
of ~uam to self-determination and independence in conformity with the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples,

Committee recalls all the relevant resolutions and decisions of the General
Assembly relating to military activities and arrangements hy colonial Powers
in Terri't:ories under their administration.

(7) TheSpec'ial'Committee urges the administering Power to continue to
take all necessary measures not to involve the Territory in any offensive acts
or interference against other States and to comply ful'y with th~ purposes and
principles of the Charter, the DeClaration and the resolutions and decisions
of the General Assembly relating to military activities and arrangements by

aaministering Power,"under'theCharter, to promote the economic and social
development of Guam. In this connection, the Committee, noting the statement
by the representativeo"f" the administering Power concerning the growth in
tourism and the Government of Guam's desire for balanced economic growth,
calls upon the administering Power to take further steps to strengthen and
diversify the economy of the Territory with a view to reducing its economic
dependence on the administe'r.i~g Power.

(9) The Special Committee, noting the potential for diversifying and
developing the economy of Guam offered, for example, by commercial fishing and
agricdlture, reaffirms its call upon the administering Power to support
measures by the territorial Government aimed at removing constraints to growth
in these areas and to ensure their development to the fullest extent.

(10) The Special Committee notes that one of the obstacles to economic
growth, particular~y agricUltural development, stems from the fact that large
tracts of land are held by the United States federal authorities (30 per cent
for military and 1 per cent for non-military purposes). The Committee further
notes from the statement by the representative of the administering Power that
legislation has been introduced in the United States Congress to release
1,431 hectares Of land no longer required by the Departinent of Defense and
that the 100th Congress of the United States has considered the issue. A
decisionhas'yet to be taken on the matter. In this connectionrthe Committee
calls upon the administering Power, in co-operation with the territorial
Government; to expedite "the transfer of land held by the United States federal
authorities to the people of the Territory and to take the necessary steps to
protect their property rights.

with the territorial Gover~ent, to continue to take effective measures to
safeguard and guarantee the inalienable right of the people ofGuam to own and
dispose of the natural resources of the Territory, including marine resources,
and to establish and maintain control over the future development of those
resources.

(12) Mindful that United Nations visiting missions provide an effective
means of assessing the situation in the Non-Self-Governing Territories, the
Special Committee reiterates the vie~ that the possibility of sending a
further visiting mission to Guam at ~n appropriate time should be 'kept under
review.

take all necessary measures not to involve the Territory in any offensive acts
or interference against other States and to comply ful'y with th~ purposes and
principles of the Charter, the DeClaration and the resolutions and decisions
of the General Assembly relating to military activities and arrangements by
colonial Powers in ~erritories under their administration.

(8) The Special Committee reaffirms the responsibility of the
aaministering Power,"under'theCharter, to promote the economic and social
development of Guam. In this connection, the Committee, noting the statement
by the representativeo"f" the administering Power concerning the growth in
tourism and the Government of Guam's desire for balanced economic growth,
calls upon the administering Power to take further steps to strengthen and
diversify the economy of the Territory with a view to reducing its economic
dependence on the administe'r.i~g Power.

(9) The Special Committee, noting the potential for diversifying and
developing the economy of Guam offered, for example, by commercial fishing and
agricdlture, reaffirms its call upon the administering Power to support
measures by the territorial Government aimed at removing constraints to growth
in these areas and to ensure their development to the fullest extent.

(10) The Special Committee notes that one of the obstacles to economic
growth, particular~y agricUltural development, stems from the fact that large
tracts of land are held by the United States federal authorities (30 per cent
for military and 1 per cent for non-military purposes). The Committee further
notes from the statement by the representative of the administering Power that
legislation has been introduced in the United States Congress to release
1,431 hectares Of land no longer required by the Departinent of Defense and
that the 100th Congress of the United States has considered the issue. A
decisionhas'yet to be taken on the matter. In this connectionrthe Committee
calls upon the administering Power, in co-operation with the territorial
Government; to expedite "the transfer of land held by the United States federal
authorities to the people of the Territory and to take the necessary steps to
protect their property rights.

(11) The Special Committee urges the administering Power, in co-operation
with the territorial Gover~ent, to continue to take effective measures to
safeguard and guarantee the inalienable right of the people ofGuam to own and
dispose of the natural resources of the Territory, including marine resources,
and to establish and maintain control over the future development of those
resources.

(12) Mindful that United Nations visiting missions provide an effective
means of assessing the situation in the Non-Self-Governing Territories, the
Special Committee reiterates the vie~ that the possibility of sending a
further visiting mission to Guam at ~n appropriate time should be 'kept under
review.

Administering Authority that the people of the Trust Territory should be given
the fullest opportunity to inform and educate themselves about the various
