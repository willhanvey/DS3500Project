Working towards the elimination of crimes against women

The General Assembly,

Reaffirming the obligation of all States to promote and protect human rights
and fundamental freedoms, as stated in the Charter of the United Nations, and
reaffirming also their obligations under later human rights instruments, in particular
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,2 the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights,2 the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
against Women3 and the Convention on the Rights of the Child,4

Bearing in mind the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against

Fourth World Conference on Women, and recalling the outcome document of the

twenty-third special session of the General Assembly entitled “Women 2000: gender
equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century”,8

Bearing in mind that crimes against women committed in the name of honour
are a human rights issue and that States have an obligation to exercise due diligence
to prevent, investigate and punish the perpetrators of such crimes and to provide
protection to the victims, and that the failure to do so constitutes a human rights
violation,

Aware that inadequate understanding of the root causes of all violence against
women, including crimes committed in the name of honour, and inadequate data on
such violence hinder informed policy analysis, both at the domestic and
international level, and efforts to eliminate such violence,

Noting general recommendation 19 concerning violence against women
adopted by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women,9

Noting also relevant paragraphs in recent reports of the special rapporteurs of
the Commission on Human Rights on violence against women, its causes and
consequences,10 summary or arbitrary executions,11 and on the independence of
judges and lawyers12 and of the Special Rapporteur of the Sub-Commission on the
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights on traditional practices affecting the
health of women and girls, its causes and consequences,13

Recalling relevant paragraphs in Commission on Human Rights resolutions
2000/45 and 2000/31,14 as well as in resolution 2000/10 of the Sub-Commission on
the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights,

Emphasizing that the elimination of crimes against women committed in the
name of honour requires greater efforts and commitment from Governments, the
international community, inter alia, by international cooperation efforts and civil
society, including non-governmental and community organizations, and that
fundamental changes in societal attitudes are required, and underlining the
importance of the empowerment of women as a tool,

1. Expresses its concern at the fact that women continue to be victims of
various forms of violence, including those that are identified in paragraph 96 (a) of
the outcome document of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly,
entitled “Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first
century”, and at the continuing occurrence in all regions of the world of such
violence, including crimes against women committed in the name of honour, which
take many different forms, and also expresses its concern at the fact that some
perpetrators assume that they have some justification for committing such crimes;

2. Welcomes the activities of States aimed at the elimination of crimes
against women committed in the name of honour, including the adoption of
amendments to relevant national laws relating to such crimes, the effective
implementation of such laws and national campaigns, all of which in some countries
have already led to a decrease in the incidence of these crimes;

3. Welcomes also the efforts, such as concrete projects, undertaken by
United Nations bodies, programmes and organizations, including the United Nations
Population Fund, the United Nations Children’s Fund and the United Nations
Development Fund for Women, to address the issue of crimes against women
committed in the name of honour, and encourages them to coordinate their efforts
and further welcomes the work carried out by civil society, including non-
governmental organizations, such as women’s organizations, grass-roots movements
and individuals, in raising awareness of such crimes and their harmful effects;

4. Calls upon all States:

(a) To implement their relevant obligations under international human rights
law, and to implement specific international commitments, including under the
outcome document of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly
entitled “Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first
century”;8

(b) To intensify efforts to prevent and eliminate crimes against women
committed in the name of honour, which take many different forms, by using
legislative, educational, social and other measures, including the dissemination of
information, and to involve, among others, public opinion leaders, educator,
religious leaders, chiefs, traditional leaders and the media in awareness-raising
campaigns;

(c) To encourage, support and implement measures and programmes aimed
at increasing the knowledge and the understanding of the causes and consequences
of crimes against women committed in the name of honour, among those responsible
for enforcing the law and implementing policies, such as police personnel, judicial
workers and health personnel;

(d) To establish, strengthen or facilitate, where possible, support services to
respond to the needs of actual and potential victims by, inter alia, providing for them
the appropriate protection, safe shelter, counselling, legal aid, rehabilitation and
reintegration into society;

(e) To create, strengthen or facilitate institutional mechanisms so that victims
and others can report such crimes in a safe and confidential environment and
encourages States to gather and disseminate statistical information on the occurrence
of such crimes;

5. Invites the international community, including United Nations bodies,
programmes and organizations, including through the technical assistance and
advisory services programmes of the Centre for International Crime Prevention, the
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the United
Nations Development Fund for Women, to support the efforts of all countries, at
their request, aimed at strengthening institutional capacity for preventing crimes
against women committed in the name of honour and at addressing their root causes;

A/C.3/55/L.11/Rev.1

6. Encourages the relevant human rights treaty bodies to continue to
address this issue, where appropriate;

7. Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report, including on
initiatives taken by States to work towards the elimination of the crimes in question,
to the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session on the subject matter of the
present resolution.
