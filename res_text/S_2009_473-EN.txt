  Draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Resolving to seek a safer world for all and to create the conditions for a world 
without nuclear weapons, in accordance with the goals of the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), in a way that promotes international 
stability, and based on the principle of undiminished security for all, 

 Reaffirming the Statement of its President adopted at the Council’s meeting at 
the level of Heads of State and Government on 31 January 1992 (S/23500), 
including the need for all Member States to fulfil their obligations in relation to 
arms control and disarmament and to prevent proliferation in all its aspects of all 
weapons of mass destruction, 

 Recalling also that the above Statement (S/23500) underlined the need for all 
Member States to resolve peacefully in accordance with the Charter any problems in 
that context threatening or disrupting the maintenance of regional and global 
stability, 

 Reaffirming that proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and their means 
of delivery, constitutes a threat to international peace and security,

relevant international organizations in the field of disarmament, arms control and 
non-proliferation, as well as the Conference on Disarmament, and supporting them 
to continue to play their due roles, 

 Underlining that the NPT remains the cornerstone of the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime and the essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear 
disarmament and for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy,  

 Reaffirming its firm commitment to the NPT and its conviction that the 
international nuclear non-proliferation regime should be maintained and 
strengthened to ensure its effective implementation, and recalling in this regard the 
outcomes of past NPT Review Conferences, including the 1995 and 2000 final 
documents, 

 Calling for further progress on all aspects of disarmament to enhance global 
security,
