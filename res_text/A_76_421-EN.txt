 III. Recommendation of the Special Political and Decolonization 
Committee (Fourth Committee)  

 

 

7. The Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) 

recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the following draft resolution:  

 

 

Information from Non-Self-Governing Territories transmitted 

under Article 73 e of the Charter of the United Nations 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 1970 (XVIII) of 16 December 1963, in which it 

requested the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation 

of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples 

to study the information transmitted to the Secretary-General in accordance with 

Article 73 e of the Charter of the United Nations and to take such information fully 

into account in examining the situation with regard to the implementation of the 

Declaration, contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 

1960, 

 Recalling also its resolution 75/102 of 10 December 2020, in which it requested 

the Special Committee to continue to discharge the functions entrusted to it under 

resolution 1970 (XVIII),  

 Stressing the importance of the timely transmission by the administering Powers 

of adequate information under Article 73 e of the Charter, in particular in relation to 

the preparation by the Secretariat of the working papers on the Territories concerned,  

 Mindful of the non-fulfilment of the obligation to transmit information on some 

Non-Self-Governing Territories in accordance with Article 73 e of the Charter,  

 Recalling its resolution 75/123 of 10 December 2020 on the Fourth International 

Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, and stressing in that regard the need to 

make real progress towards its full implementation,  

 Having examined the report of the Secretary-General,1  

 1. Reaffirms that, in the absence of a decision by the General Assembly itself 

that a Non-Self-Governing Territory has attained a full measure of self-government 

in terms of Chapter XI of the Charter of the United Nations, the administering Power 

concerned should continue to transmit information under Article 73 e of the Charter 

with respect to that Territory;  

 2. Requests the administering Powers concerned to respect their obligations 

under Article 73 e of the Charter with regard to each Territory on the agenda of the 

Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the 

Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples;  

 3. Also requests the administering Powers concerned, in accordance with 

their Charter obligations, to transmit or continue to transmit regularly to the 

Secretary-General for information purposes, subject to such limitation as security and 

constitutional considerations may require, statistical and other information of a 

technical nature relating to the economic, social and educational conditions in the 

Territories for which they are respectively responsible, as well as the fullest possible 

information on political and constitutional developments in the Territories concerned, 

including the constitution, legislative act or executive order providing for the
