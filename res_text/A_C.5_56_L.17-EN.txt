The General Assembly,

Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June
2002,1 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions,2

Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 425 (1978) of 19 March 1978, by

and its subsequent resolutions thereon, the most recent of which was resolution
55/180 B of 14 June 2001,

Reaffirming its resolutions 51/233 of 13 June 1997, 52/237 of 26 June 1998,
53/227 of 8 June 1999, 54/267 of 15 June 2000, 55/180 A of 19 December 2000 and
55/180 B,

Reaffirming also the general principles underlying the financing of United

Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Force with the necessary
financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant
resolutions of the Security Council,

Concerned that the Secretary-General continues to face difficulties in meeting
the obligations of the Force on a current basis, including reimbursement to current
and former troop-contributing States,

Concerned also that the surplus balances in the Special Account for the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon have been used to meet expenses of the Force in
order to compensate for the lack of income resulting from non-payment and late
payment by Member States of their contributions,

Force in Lebanon as at 15 November 2001, including the contributions outstanding

total assessed contributions from the inception of the Force to the period ending 31
December 2001, notes that some 15.5 per cent of the Member States have paid their
assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in
particular those in arrears, to ensure payment of their outstanding assessed
contributions;

paragraph 14 of its resolution 54/267, paragraph 14 of its resolution 55/180 A and
