Respect for the right to universal freedom of travel and the vital
importance of family reunification

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolution 57/227 of 18 December 2002,

Reaffirming that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are universal,
indivisible, interdependent and interrelated,

Recalling the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 as
well as article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,2

Stressing that, as stated in the Programme of Action of the International
Conference on Population and Development,3 family reunification of documented
migrants is an important factor in international migration and that remittances by
documented migrants to their countries of origin often constitute a very important
source of foreign exchange and are instrumental in improving the well-being of
relatives left behind,

Noting that while some positive developments occurred during the past two
years in the accomplishment of the objectives highlighted in General Assembly
resolution 57/227, in particular the commitment made on 9 June 2004 at the summit
meeting of the Group of Eight, held in Sea Island, Georgia, United States of

family reunification and the possibility of sending remittances to their relatives in
the country of origin,

Recalling that the family is the basic unit of society and, as such, should be
strengthened, and that it is entitled to receive comprehensive protection and support,

1. Once again calls upon all States to guarantee the universally recognized
freedom of travel to all foreign nationals legally residing in their territory;

2. Reaffirms that all Governments, in particular those of receiving countries,
must recognize the vital importance of family reunification and promote its
incorporation into national legislation in order to ensure protection of the unity of
families of documented migrants;

3. Calls upon all States to allow, in conformity with international
legislation, the free flow of financial remittances by foreign nationals residing in
their territory to their relatives in the country of origin;

4. Also calls upon all States to refrain from enacting, and to repeal if it
already exists, legislation intended as a coercive measure that discriminates against
individuals or groups of legal migrants by adversely affecting family reunification
and the right to send financial remittances to relatives in the country of origin;

5. Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to
request comments from Governments, intergovernmental and non-governmental
