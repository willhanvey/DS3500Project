 Reiterating its strong and unequivocal condemnation  of all acts, methods and 

practices of terrorism and violent extremism as and when conducive to terrorism in 

all its forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomsoever committed, 

regardless of their motivation,  

 Recognizing that terrorism has a detrimental effect on the full enjoyment of all 

human rights and fundamental freedoms, and impedes the full enjoyment of 

political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights,  

 Strongly condemning the systematic recruitment and use of children to 

perpetrate terrorist attacks, as well as the violations and abuses committed by 

terrorist groups against children, including killing and maiming, abduction and rape 

and other forms of sexual violence, and noting that such violations and abuses may 

amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity,  

 Expressing deep concern that acts of sexual and gender-based violence are 

known to be part of the strategic objectives and ideology of certain terrorist groups 

and are used as an instrument to increase their power through supporting financing 

and recruitment and through the destruction of communities,  

 Emphasizing that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent 

and interrelated,  

 Reaffirming the fundamental importance of respecting all human rights and 

fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, and reiterating that all States have an 

obligation to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to 

ensure implementation of their obligations under international human rights law and 

international humanitarian law, as applicable,  

 Reaffirming that the promotion and the protection of human rights for all and 

the rule of law are essential to the fight against terrorism, recognizing that effective 

counter-terrorism measures and the protection of human rights are not conflicting 

goals, but are complimentary and mutually reinforcing, and stressing the need to 

promote and protect the rights of victims of terrorism,  

 Stressing that States have a responsibility to protect individuals within their 

territory and subject to their jurisdiction from acts of terrorism, to take effective 

counter-terrorism measures and to investigate and prosecute those responsible for 

carrying out such acts, and emphasizing the importance of ensuring that counter-

terrorism laws, measures and practices are human rights -compliant,  

 Renewing its unwavering commitment to strengthening international 

cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism and violent extremism as and when 

conducive to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and reaffirming that any 

acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, 

wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed,  

 Emphasizing that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any 

religion, nationality, civilization or ethnic group, and that tolerance, pluralism, 

inclusion and respect for diversity, dialogue among civilizations and the 

enhancement of interfaith and intercultural understanding and respect among 

people, including at the national, regional and global levels, while avoiding the 

escalation of hatred, are among the most important elements in promoting 

cooperation and success in preventing and combating terrorism, and welcoming the 

various initiatives to that end,  

 Reaffirming the commitment of Member States to take measures aimed at 

addressing the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism, including but not 

limited to prolonged unresolved conflicts, the dehumanization of victims of 

terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, lack of the rule of law and violations 



 
A/C.3/72/L.49/Rev.1 

 

3/4 17-20150 

 

and abuses of human rights, ethnic, national and religious discrimination, political 

exclusion, socioeconomic marginalization and lack of good governance, while 

recognizing that none of these conditions can excuse or justify acts of terrorism,  

 Conscious that there are a number of drivers underlying radicalization to 

terrorism and that development based on the principles of social justice, inclusion 

and equal opportunities can contribute to the prevention of terrorism and violent 

extremism as and when conducive to terrorism, as well as to the promotion of 

inclusive, open and resilient societies, notably through education, and affirming the 

determination of States to work towards conflict resolution, to confront oppression, 

to eradicate poverty, to promote sustained economic growth, sustainable 

development, global prosperity, good governance, human rights and fundamental 

freedoms for all and the rule of law, to improve intercultural understanding and to

truth, in accordance with international law;  

 5. Recognizes that terrorism has a grave impact on the full enjoyment of al l

and increasing security costs;  

 6. Urges States to protect persons within their territory and subject to their 

jurisdiction by preventing and countering terrorism in all its forms and 

manifestations, in full compliance with their international legal obligations, and to 

respect and protect all human rights while countering terrorism in accordance with 

international law, in particular international human rights law, international refugee 

law and international humanitarian law;  

 7. Calls upon Member States to remain alert to the use of information and 

communications technology for terrorist purposes and to cooperate to counter 

violent extremist propaganda and incitement to violence on the Internet and social 

media, including by developing effective counter-narratives, and to prevent 

terrorists from recruiting and raising funds online for terrorist purposes, while 

respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, in compliance with their 

obligations under international law, and stresses the importance of cooperation with
