Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (“Johannesburg 
Plan of Implementation”),5 as well as the Monterrey Consensus of the International 
Conference on Financing for Development,6 

 Reaffirming the commitment to implement Agenda 21, the Programme for the 
Further Implementation of Agenda 21, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, 
including the time-bound goals and targets, and the other internationally agreed 
development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, 

 Reaffirming also the goals set in paragraph 19 of the Millennium Declaration,7 
to halve poverty and hunger by 2015, 

 Reaffirming further that eradicating poverty is the greatest global challenge 
facing the world today and an indispensable requirement for sustainable 
development, particularly for developing countries, and that although each country 
has the primary responsibility for its own sustainable development and poverty 
eradication and the role of national policies and development strategies cannot be 
overemphasized, concerted and concrete measures are required at all levels to 
enable developing countries to achieve their sustainable development goals as 
related to the internationally agreed poverty-related targets and goals, including 
those contained in Agenda 21, the relevant outcomes of other United Nations 
conferences and the United Nations Millennium Declaration,8 

 Recalling the 2005 World Summit Outcome,9 

 Recalling also its resolution 60/265 of 30 June 2006, 

 Recognizing that the achievement of many of the internationally agreed 
development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, in many 
countries is currently off track, and emphasizing that vigorous implementation of all 
development commitments will be needed without delay if the Goals are to be 
achieved, 

 Remaining concerned that Africa is the only continent currently not on track to 
achieve any of the goals of the Millennium Declaration by 2015, and in this regard 
emphasizing that concerted efforts and continued support are required to fulfil the 
commitments to address the special needs of Africa, 

 Noting the preparatory work being carried out by the Commission on 
Sustainable Development for its next two-year cycle, with the thematic focus on 
agriculture, rural development, land, drought, desertification and Africa, 

 Concerned by the relatively slow progress so far in achieving the above-
mentioned goals, especially the hunger target and goals, and recognizing the need to 
redouble the efforts of the international community in its attempt to reach the 
internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development 
Goals,

 Reaffirming that agriculture plays a crucial role in addressing the needs of a 
growing global population and is inextricably linked to poverty eradication, 
especially in developing countries, and that enhancing the role of women at all 
levels and in all aspects of rural development, agriculture, nutrition and food 
security is imperative and that sustainable agriculture and rural development are 
essential to the implementation of an integrated approach to increasing food 
production and enhancing food security and food safety in an environmentally 
sustainable way,10 

 Considering the increasing need to innovate in agriculture and food production 
to adapt, inter alia, to climate change, urbanization and globalization, 

 Cognizant that technological methods to advance these goals should be 
sustainable, accessible and of benefit to poor people, taking into account relevant 
international instruments and the internationally agreed development goals, 
including the Millennium Development Goals, 

 Recognizing that appropriate, affordable and sustainable agricultural 
technologies can play an important role in helping Member States alleviate poverty 
and eradicate hunger, 

 1. Calls upon Member States, especially those in a position to do so, and 
relevant United Nations organizations to make greater efforts to promote the 
development and transfer of appropriate technologies in and to developing countries 
under fair, transparent and mutually agreed terms, as well as to support national 
efforts to foster the effective utilization of local know-how and technology and 
promote agricultural research and technologies to enable poor rural men and women 
to increase agricultural productivity and enhanced food security; 

 2. Underlines the need for Member States to make their knowledge and 
know-how in the field of agricultural technology and agricultural innovation 
systems more accessible, in particular to poor people, subject to appropriate 
arrangements; 

 3. Reiterates that the eradication of poverty, hunger and malnutrition, in 
particular as they affect children, is crucial for the achievement of the Millennium 
Development Goals and that rural and agricultural development should be an 
integral part of national and international development policies, calls for increased 
productive investment in rural and agricultural development to achieve food 
security, in this regard calls for enhanced support for agricultural development and 
trade capacity-building in the agricultural sector in developing countries, including 
by the international community and the United Nations system, and encourages 
support for commodity development projects, especially market-based projects, and 
for their preparation under the Second Account of the Common Fund for 
Commodities; 

 4. Notes with satisfaction the contribution made by the “Technology for 
Agriculture” initiative of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
Nations; 

 5. Urges the relevant bodies of the United Nations system to support the 
efforts of Member States, in particular developing countries, to take full advantage

of new knowledge in agricultural technology, agricultural innovation, research and 
development to achieve relevant Millennium Development Goals, specifically the 
eradication of poverty and hunger; 

 6. Calls upon public and private institutions to further develop improved 
varieties of crops that are appropriate for various regions, especially those 
challenged by environmental factors, including climate change, and to develop and 
manage these crops in a sustainable manner, and calls for further efforts by all 
stakeholders to ensure that improved crop varieties are made available and 
affordable to smallholder farmers in a manner consistent with national regulations 
and relevant international agreements; 

 7. Underscores the importance of support to agricultural research, and calls 
for continued support to international agricultural research systems, including the 
International Agricultural Research Centres of the Consultative Group on 
International Agricultural Research, as well as other relevant international 
organizations; 

 8. Recognizes the importance of relevant institutions providing effective 
mechanisms for public-private agricultural advisory services, as well as extension, 
financial and market services to farmers, in particular smallholder farmers, so that 
the benefits of new knowledge, agricultural innovation systems and improved 
technology may reach them and be used by them; 

 9. Invites Member States, especially those in a position to do so, and 
relevant regional and international organizations to allocate financial and technical 
resources to support the development of efficient, productive and environmentally 
sound technologies for sustainable agriculture in developing countries; 

 10. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its 
sixty-fourth session a report on the implementation of the present resolution.
