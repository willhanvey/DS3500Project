draft resolution 
 

 

  Ethical imperatives for a nuclear-weapon-free world 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations, which was 

established to save succeeding generations from the untold suffering of the scourge 

of war, 

 Recalling also that the United Nations emerged at the time of the immense 

trail of death and destruction resulting from the Second World War, 70 years ago, 

 Recalling further the noble principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 

which enjoin the international community, individually and collectively, to spare no 

effort in promoting the ethical imperative of “in larger freedom”, so that all peoples 

may enjoy freedom from want, freedom from fear, and the freedom to live in 

dignity, 

 Convinced that given the catastrophic humanitarian consequences and risks 

associated with a nuclear weapon detonation, Member States have long envisaged 

nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation as urgent and interlinked ethical 

imperatives in achieving the objectives of the Charter of the United Nations, whi ch 

is reflected in the first resolution, resolution 1 (I), adopted by the General Assembly 

on 24 January 1946, aimed at the elimination from national armaments of atomic 

weapons and of all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction,  

 Acknowledging in this connection the ethical imperatives outlined in the 

provisions of its resolutions and reports and those of other related international 

initiatives on the catastrophic humanitarian consequences and risks posed by a 

nuclear weapon detonation, including the declaration that the use of nuclear 

weapons would cause indiscriminate suffering and as such is a violation of the 

Charter of the United Nations and the laws of humanity and international law,

condemnation of nuclear war as contrary to the prerogative of human conscience 

and a violation of the fundamental right to life,
2
 the threat to the very survival of 

humankind posed by the existence of nuclear weapons,
3
 the detrimental 

environmental effects of the use of nuclear weapons,
4
 and the disquiet that was 

expressed at the continued spending on the development and maintenance of nuclear 

arsenals,
5
 

 Acknowledging also the preamble and article VI of the Treaty on the 

Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
6
 and the advisory opinion of the International 

Court of Justice on the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons,
7
 in which 

the Court unanimously concluded that there exists an obligation to pursue in good 

faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its 

aspects under strict and effective international control,  

 Acknowledging further the United Nations Millennium Declaration,
8
 in which 

Heads of State and Government resolved to strive for the elimination of weapons of 

mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, and to keep all options open for 

achieving this aim, including the possibility of convening an international 

conference to identify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers,  

 Concerned that, despite the long-standing recognition it has accorded to these 

ethical imperatives and while much effort has been directed to addressing nuclear 

non-proliferation, limited progress has been made in meeting the nuclear 

disarmament obligations required to achieve and maintain the nuclear -weapon-free 

world that the international community demands, 

 Disappointed at the continued absence of progress towards multilateral 

negotiations on nuclear disarmament in the Conference on Disarmament, despite 

unrelenting efforts of Member States towards this end, and the lack of concrete 

outcomes of multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations within the United 

Nations framework, 

 Noting with satisfaction the increasing awareness, renewed attention and 

growing momentum that has been generated by Member States and the international 

community since 2010 regarding the catastrophic humanitarian consequences and 

risks associated with nuclear weapons, which underpin the ethical imperatives for 

nuclear disarmament and the urgency of achieving and maintaining a nuclear -

weapon-free world, together with all related international initiatives,  

 Conscious of the absolute validity of multilateral diplomacy in relation to 

nuclear disarmament, and determined to promote multilateralism as essential to 

nuclear disarmament negotiations,  

 1. Calls upon all States to acknowledge the catastrophic humanitarian 

consequences and risks posed by a nuclear weapon detonation, whether by accident, 

miscalculation or design;

 2. Acknowledges the ethical imperatives for nuclear disarmament and the 

urgency of achieving and maintaining a nuclear-weapon-free world, which is a 

“global public good of the highest order”, serving both national and collective 

security interests; 

 3. Declares: 

 (a) That the global threat posed by nuclear weapons must urgently be 

eliminated; 

 (b) That discussions, decisions and actions on nuclear weapons must focus 

on the effects of these weapons on human beings and the environment and must be 

guided by the unspeakable suffering and unacceptable harm that they cause;  

 (c) That greater attention must be given to the impact of a nuclear weapon 

detonation on women and the importance of their participation in discussions, 

decisions and actions on nuclear weapons;  

 (d) That nuclear weapons serve to undermine collective security, heighten 

the risk of nuclear catastrophe, aggravate international tension and make conflict 

more dangerous; 

 (e) That arguments in favour of the retention of nuclear weapons have a 

negative impact on the credibility of the nuclear disarmament and non -proliferation 

regime; 

 (f) That the long-term plans for the modernization of nuclear weapons 

arsenals run contrary to commitments and obligations to nuclear disarmament and 

engender perceptions of the indefinite possession of these weapons;  

 (g) That, in a world where basic human needs have not yet been met, the 

vast resources allocated to the modernization of nuclear weapons arsenals could 

instead be redirected to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals;  

 (h) That, given the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons, it is 

inconceivable that any use of nuclear weapons, irrespective of the cause, would be 

compatible with the requirements of international humanitarian law or international 

law, or the laws of morality, or the dictates of public conscience;  

 (i) That, given their indiscriminate nature and potential to annihilate 

humanity, nuclear weapons are inherently immoral;  

 4. Notes that all responsible States have a solemn duty to take decisions that 

serve to protect their people and each other from the ravages of a nuclear weapon 

detonation, and that the only way for States to do so is through the total elimination 

of nuclear weapons; 

 5. Stresses that all States share an ethical responsibility to act with urgency 

and determination, with the support of all relevant stakeholders, to take the effective 

measures, including legally binding measures, necessary to eliminate and prohibit 

all nuclear weapons, given their catastrophic humanitarian consequences and 

associated risks; 

 6. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-first session, 

under the item entitled “General and complete disarmament”, a sub -item entitled 

“Ethical imperatives for a nuclear-weapon-free world”.
