  United States of America: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming all previous resolutions and Presidential statements concerning the 

situation in Abyei and along the border between Sudan and South Sudan and 

underlining the importance of full compliance with and implementation of these,  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 

territorial integrity of Sudan and South Sudan, and to the purposes and the principles 

of the Charter of the United Nations, and recalling the importance of the principles of 

good neighbourliness, non-interference and regional cooperation,  

 Reiterating that the territorial boundaries of States shall not be altered by force, 

and that any territorial disputes shall be settled exclusively by peaceful means, 

affirming the priority it attaches to the full and urgent implementation of all 

outstanding issues from the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), underscoring 

that the future status of Abyei shall be resolved by negotiations between the parties 

in a manner consistent with the CPA and not by the unilateral actions of either party, 

and recalling prior agreements on the administration and security of the Abyei Area,  

 Welcoming continued cooperation between the Government of the Republic of 

the Sudan and Government of the Republic of South Sudan in support  of peace, 

security and stability, including the signing of the Juba Peace Agreement on Sudan 

on 3 October 2020, further welcoming recent high-level discussions between Sudan 

and South Sudan on the status of Abyei, and the convening of the Joint Political and 

Security Mechanism (JPSM) 28–29 October 2020, and encouraging that such 

meetings and those of other joint mechanisms take place on a consistent basis,  

 Encouraging the African Union, the African Union High-Level Implementation 

Panel (AUHIP), and the UN Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Horn of 

Africa to intensify their mediation roles with the Governments of South Sudan and 

Sudan to encourage them to establish temporary administrative and security 

arrangements for Abyei and to achieve a political solution for the status of Abyei, and 

commending the continued assistance provided to the parties by the Federal 

Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, and the United Nations Interim Security Force for 

Abyei (UNISFA), 

 Acknowledging that over the course of the nine years since establishment of 

UNISFA the mission has contributed towards the stabilization and demilitarization of 

the Abyei Area and together with the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring 

Mechanism (JBVMM) played a stabilizing role along the borders between South 

Sudan and Sudan,  



S/2020/1098 
 

 

20-15090 2/7 

 

 Stressing the need to reconfigure the mission to adapt to the current security 

situation and to develop a viable exit strategy and plan for a responsible drawdown 

of UNISFA based on the improved ability of Sudan and South Sudan to manage 

bilateral disputes, which prioritizes safety and security of civilians living in Abyei 

and accounts for the stability of the region,  

 Underlining that over the course of nine years the Government of Sudan and the 

Government of South Sudan have not made progress establishing joint institutions in 

Abyei, and encouraging Sudan and South Sudan to engage in substantive dialogue 

that can advance the political process for resolution of the Abyei dispute,  

 Expressing concern that the delayed deployment of UN police to the level 

authorized by the Council prevents UNISFA from fulfilling its security mandate and 

holds the potential to create a security vacuum in Abyei, and further expressing 

concern about Sudan and South Sudan’s efforts to impede UNISFA from fully 

executing its mandate, including by withholding visas for police, blocking 

appointment of a civilian Deputy Head of Mission and denying access to Athony 

airport, which would ease UNISFA’s logistical challenges, reduce transport costs,  and 

enhance safety and security for UNISFA personnel,  

 Commending the efforts of UNISFA, notwithstanding the impediments referred 

to in the previous paragraph, in its attempts to carry out its mandate effectively, 

including by its ongoing facilitation of peaceful migration throughout the Abyei Area, 

conflict prevention, mediation and deterrence, and expressing grave concern about 

the security threats and targeted attacks against United Nations peacekeepers in 

UNISFA, strongly underscoring the unacceptability of any attack on United Nations 

personnel, and reiterating that such attacks, which may constitute war crimes, should 

be swiftly and thoroughly investigated, and that those responsible should be held to 

account, 

 Bearing in mind that people in the Abyei Area continue to rely on humanitarian 

assistance, that access for humanitarian organizations to reach people in need remains 

of crucial importance, and that humanitarian actors continue to provide assistance to 

210,000 people in the Abyei Area,  

 Recalling resolutions 1325 (2000) and subsequent resolutions on women, peace, 

and security and emphasizing that persistent barriers to full implementation of these 

resolutions will only be dismantled through dedicated commitment to women’s 

empowerment, participation, and human rights, and through concerted leadership, 

consistent information and action, and support,  

 Recognizing that the current situation in Abyei and along the border between 

Sudan and South Sudan continues to constitute a threat to international peace and 

security, 

 1. Decides to extend until 15 May 2021 the mandate of UNISFA as set out in

as set out in paragraph 3 of resolution 1990 (2011); 

 2. Decides to extend until 15 May 2021 UNISFA’s mandate modification set 

forth in resolution 2024 (2011) and paragraph 1 of resolution 2075 (2012), which

Mechanism (JBVMM), and further decides that this shall be the final such extension 

unless the parties take the specific measures described in paragraph 3;  

 3. Determines that both parties should continue to demonstrate measurable

including police; 

 8. Urges that the Governments of Sudan and South Sudan facilitate basing 

arrangements for UNISFA in the Mission area including Athony airport, and provide

travel and air cargo needs for the Mission, increase humanitarian access, and enhance

the SDBZ in no way prejudices the current or future legal status of the border, ongoing 

negotiations on the disputed and claimed areas, and demarcation of the borders;

paragraph 3 of resolution 1990 (2011) includes taking the necessary actions to protect 

civilians under imminent threat of physical violence, irrespective of the source of 

such violence, and in that regard underlines that peacekeepers are authorized to use 

all necessary means, which includes the use of force when required, in order to protect 

civilians under threat of physical violence, in accordance with mission mandates, the 

United Nations Charter and other applicable international law, and stresses the
