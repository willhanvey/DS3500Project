situation in the CAR, characterized by a total breakdown in law and order, the

concern about the consequences of instability in the CAR, on the central African 
region and beyond, and stressing in this regard the need for the international 
community to respond swiftly,  

 Remaining seriously concerned by multiple and increasing violations of 
international humanitarian law and the widespread human rights violations and

disappearances, arbitrary arrests and detention, torture, sexual violence against women 
and children, rape, recruitment and use of children and attacks against civilians,

crimes under international law in particular war crimes and crimes against humanity, 
with serious regional implications, 

 Further expressing concern at the insufficient capacity of the police, justice 
and corrections institutions to hold perpetrators of such violations and abuses 
accountable,

their leaders and encouraging all parties and stakeholders in the CAR to support and 
contribute effectively, with the assistance of the international community, to
