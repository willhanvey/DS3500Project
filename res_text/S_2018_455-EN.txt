Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the Federal Democratic Republic of 

Ethiopia, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Sudan and South Sudan, and 

United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA),  

 Acknowledging that over the course of the seven years since establishment of 

UNISFA, the mission has been able to stabilize and demilitarize the Abyei Area and 

that UNISFA is now an interim security force with no viable exit strategy, and in this 

regard, taking note of the need to reconfigure the mission in order to create the space 

for a viable political process that would also serve as an exit strategy,  

 Taking note of the security situation in the Abyei Area as characterized by the

conflict prevention, mediation and deterrence, and strongly underscoring the 

unacceptability of any attack on United Nations personnel, and reiterating that such 

attacks, which may constitute a war crime, should be swiftly and thoroughly

 Further recalling resolutions 1325 (2000) and subsequent resolutions on 

women, peace, and security and emphasizing that persistent barriers to full 

implementation of these resolutions will only be dismantled through dedicated

concerted leadership, consistent information and action, and support, to build 

women’s engagement in all levels of decision-making, also recalling resolution 2242 

and its aspiration to increase the number of women in military and police contingents

decision of the Secretary-General to appoint a civilian head of mission,
