 Gravely concerned about the extremely difficult socioeconomic conditions 

being faced by the Palestine refugees in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 

including East Jerusalem, particularly in the refugee camps in the Gaza Strip, as a 

result of the recurrent military operations, continuing prolonged Israeli closures, the 

construction of settlements and the wall, and the severe economic and movement 

restrictions that in effect amount to a blockade, which have deepened 

unemployment and poverty rates among the refugees, with potentially lasting, long -

term negative effects, while taking note of developments with regard to the situation 

of access there, 

 Deploring the conflict in and around the Gaza Strip in July and August 2014,

networks, economic, industrial and agricultural properties, public institutions,

in November 2012, on the humanitarian and socioeconomic situation of the 

Palestine refugees in the Gaza Strip,

 Recognizing the need for the swift implementation of all aspects of the 

temporary tripartite agreement facilitated by the United Nations in September 2014,
