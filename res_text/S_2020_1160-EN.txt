  United States of America: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council,  

 Recalling its previous resolutions concerning the situation in Somalia, 

especially resolutions 1814 (2008), 1816 (2008), 1838 (2008), 1844 (2008), 1846 

(2008), 1851 (2008), 1897 (2009), 1918 (2010), 1950 (2010), 1976 (2011), 2015 

(2011), 2020 (2011), 2077 (2012), 2125 (2013), 2184 (2014), 2246 (2015), 2316 

(2016), 2383 (2017), 2442 (2018), and 2500 (2019), as well as the Statements of its 

President (S/PRST/2010/16) of 25 August 2010 and (S/PRST/2012/24) of 

19 November 2012,  

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General (S/2020/1072), as requested by 

resolution 2500 (2019), on the implementation of that resolution and on the situation 

with respect to piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia,  

 Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political 

independence, and unity of Somalia, including Somalia’s sovereign rights in 

accordance with international law, with respect to offshore natural resources, 

including fisheries,  

 Welcoming that there were no successful piracy attacks off the coast of Somalia 

in the prior 12 months, and noting that joint counter-piracy efforts have resulted in a 

steady decline in pirate attacks as well as in hijackings since 2011, with no successful 

ship hijackings for ransom reported off the coast of Somalia since March 2017 

however, recognizing the ongoing threat that resurgent piracy and armed robbery at 

sea poses, noting the letter of 2 December 2020 from the Permanent Representative 

of the Permanent Mission of Somalia to the United Nations requesting international 

assistance to counter piracy off its coast, and recalling reports of the Secretary 

General and communiqués of the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia 

(CGPCS), which continue to illustrate that piracy off the coast of Somalia has been 

repressed but not eradicated, and commending countries and organizations that have 

deployed naval counter-piracy missions in the region to suppress piracy and protect 

ships transiting through the waters off the coast of Somalia and the region,  

 Reaffirming that international law, as reflected in the United Nations 

Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (“The Convention”), sets out 

the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried 

out, including countering piracy and armed robbery at sea,  

 Recognizing the need and commending the efforts of States, including in 

particular States in the region, to investigate and prosecute not only suspec ts captured 

at sea, but also anyone who incites or intentionally facilitates piracy operations,
