Globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment
of all human rights

The General Assembly,

Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,
and expressing in particular the need to achieve international cooperation in
promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for
all without distinction,

Recalling the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 as well as the Vienna
Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human
Rights on 25 June 1993,2

Recalling also the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights3 and
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,3

Reaffirming the Declaration on the Right to Development adopted by the
General Assembly in its resolution 41/128 of 4 December 1986,

Recognizing that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and
interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in
a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the same emphasis,

Realizing that globalization affects all countries differently and makes them
more susceptible to external developments, positive as well as negative, including in
the field of human rights,

A/C.3/55/L.48

Realizing also that globalization is not merely an economic process, but also
has social, political, environmental, cultural and legal dimensions which have an
impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights,

Recognizing that multilateral mechanisms have a unique role to play in
meeting the challenges and opportunities presented by globalization,

Alarmed over the instability and unpredictability generated by unhampered
movement of capital in some countries resulting from the liberalization of capital
markets and its extremely negative impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights
by peoples of those countries,

Emphasizing that the core value of respect for life, liberty, justice, tolerance
and mutual respect as enunciated in the Charter and the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights should be guiding objectives of globalization with a human face,

Deeply concerned that the widening gap between the developed and the
developing countries has deepened poverty and adversely affected the full
enjoyment of all human rights by peoples, particularly in developing countries,

Noting that human beings strive for a world that is respectful of cultures,
identities and human rights and that, in that regard, they work to ensure that all
activities, including those affected by globalization, are consistent with those aims,

1. Recognizes that, while globalization, by its impact on, inter alia, the role
of the State, may affect human rights, the promotion and protection of all human
rights is first and foremost the responsibility of the State;

2. Emphasizes that narrowing the gaps between rich and poor, both within
and between all countries, should be the explicit global goal as part of the effort to
create an enabling environment for the full enjoyment of all human rights by all
peoples and for the eradication of poverty;

3. Underlines therefore the need to analyse the consequences of
globalization on the full enjoyment of all human rights;

4. Affirms the importance of establishing an open, rule-based, accountable,
predictable, just, equitable, comprehensive, development-oriented and non-
discriminatory system of social and economic relations for the full enjoyment of all
human rights;

5. Expresses concern that while globalization holds out the promise of
prosperity, it brings with it severe challenges for the developing countries and that
the promise of prosperity has not touched the vast majority of the world’s
population, especially in the least developed countries, which affects the economic,
social and cultural rights of their people;

6. Stresses that globalization has to be monitored and managed with a view
to enhancing its positive impact and alleviating its negative consequences on the
enjoyment of all human rights, both at the national and international levels;

7. Affirms that globalization is a complex historical process of structural
transformations, with numerous interdisciplinary aspects, and has a direct impact on
the enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, as well as the
right to development, at both the national and international levels;



3

A/C.3/55/L.48

8. Takes note of the preliminary report of the Secretary-General on
globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights,4 and requests
the Secretary-General to submit a comprehensive report on this subject to the fifth-
sixth session of the General Assembly.
