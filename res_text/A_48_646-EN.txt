Self-Government Arrangements, including its Annexes, and its Agreed Minutes, at
Washington, D.C., on 13 September 1993, 12/

1. Notes with regret that repatriation or compensation of the refugees,
as provided for in paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), has
not yet been effected and that, therefore, the situation of the refugees
continues to be a matter of concern;

2. Expresses its thanks to the Commissioner-General and to all the staff
of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near
East, recognizing that the Agency is doing all it can within the limits of
available resources, and also expresses its thanks to the specialized agencies
and to private organizations for their valuable work in assisting the refugees;

3. Requests that the headquarters of the Agency should be transferred as
soon as practicable to its area of operations;

4. Notes with regret that the United Nations Conciliation Commission for
Palestine has been unable to find a means of achieving progress in the
implementation of paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), 13/
and requests the Commission to exert continued efforts towards the
implementation of that paragraph and to report to the Assembly as appropriate,
but no later than 1 September 1994;

5. Notes that the new context created by the Israeli-Palestinian accord
of 13 September 1993 will have major consequences for the activities of the
Agency, which is henceforth called upon, within the framework of strengthened
cooperation with the specialized agencies and the World Bank, to make a decisive
contribution towards giving a fresh impetus to the economic and social stability
of the occupied territories, and notes also that the functioning of the Agency
remains essential throughout its area of operations;

6. Welcomes the results of the International Donors Conference to Support
Middle East Peace, held on 1 October 1993, concerning urgent financial and
economic assistance in support of the Israeli-Palestinian accord, and urges all
Member States to extend aid and assistance with a view to the economic
development of the occupied territories;

7. Directs attention to the continuing seriousness of the financial
position of the Agency, as outlined in the report of the Commissioner-General;

8. Notes with profound concern that, despite the commendable and
successful efforts of the Commissioner-General to collect additional
contributions, the increased level of income to the Agency is still insufficient
to cover essential budget requirements in the current year and that, at the
currently foreseen levels of contributions, deficits will recur each year;

generous efforts possible to meet the anticipated needs of the Agency, and
therefore urges non-contributing Governments to contribute regularly and
contributing Governments to consider increasing their regular contributions.
