  Oil slick on Lebanese shores 
 
 

 The General Assembly,  

 Recalling its resolutions 61/194 of 20 December 2006, 62/188 of 19 December 
2007, 63/211 of 19 December 2008 and 64/195 of 21 December 2009 on the oil 
slick on Lebanese shores,  

 Reaffirming the outcome of the United Nations Conference on the Human 
Environment, especially principle 7 of the Declaration of the Conference,1 in which 
States were requested to take all possible steps to prevent pollution of the seas,  

 Emphasizing the need to protect and preserve the marine environment in 
accordance with international law,  

 Taking into account the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and 
Development,2 especially principle 16, in which it was stipulated that the polluter 
should, in principle, bear the cost of pollution, and taking into account also chapter 
17 of Agenda 21,3 

 Noting with great concern the environmental disaster caused by the destruction 
by the Israeli Air Force on 15 July 2006 of the oil storage tanks in the direct vicinity 
of Jiyeh electric power plant in Lebanon, resulting in an oil slick that covered the 
entirety of the Lebanese coastline and extended to the Syrian coastline,

 Noting, further, that the Secretary-General expressed grave concern at the lack 
of acknowledgment on the part of the Government of Israel of its responsibilities 
vis-à-vis reparations and compensation to the Government and people of Lebanon 
and the Syrian Arab Republic affected by the oil spill,  

 Acknowledging that the Secretary-General concluded that this oil spill is not 
covered by any of the international oil spill compensation funds and thus merits 
special consideration,4 and recognizing his recommendation that further 
consideration be given to the option of examining the potential role of the 
Compensation Commission in securing the relevant compensations from the 
Government of Israel, 

 Noting again with appreciation the assistance offered by donor countries and 
international organizations for the clean-up operations and the early recovery and 
reconstruction of Lebanon through bilateral and multilateral channels, including the 
Athens Coordination Meeting on the response to the marine pollution incident in the 
Eastern Mediterranean, held on 17 August 2006, as well as the Stockholm 
Conference for Lebanon’s Early Recovery, held on 31 August 2006, 

 Acknowledging that the Secretary-General has welcomed the agreement of the 
Lebanon Recovery Fund to host the Eastern Mediterranean Oil Spill Restoration 
Trust Fund under its existing mechanisms, 

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation 
of General Assembly resolution 64/195 on the oil slick on Lebanese shores;5 

 2. Reiterates the expression of its deep concern, for the fifth consecutive 
year, about the adverse implications of the destruction by the Israeli Air Force of the 
oil storage tanks in the direct vicinity of the Lebanese Jiyeh electric power plant for 
the achievement of sustainable development in Lebanon;  

 3. Considers that the oil slick has heavily polluted the shores of Lebanon 
and partially polluted Syrian shores and consequently has had serious implications 
for livelihoods and the economy of Lebanon, owing to the adverse implications for 
natural resources, biodiversity, fisheries and tourism, and for human health, in the 
country; 

 4. Requests the Government of Israel to assume responsibility for prompt 
and adequate compensation to the Government of Lebanon and other countries 
directly affected by the oil slick, such as the Syrian Arab Republic whose shores 
have been partially polluted, for the costs of repairing the environmental damage 
caused by the destruction, including the restoration of the marine environment, in 
particular in the light of the Secretary-General’s remark concerning the lack of any 
acknowledgement on the part of the Government of Israel of the relevant paragraphs 
of Assembly resolutions 61/194, 62/188, 63/211 or 64/195; 

 5. Requests the Secretary-General to give further consideration to the option 
of examining the potential role of the Compensation Commission in securing the 
relevant compensation from the Government of Israel; 

 6. Reiterates the expression of its appreciation for the efforts of the 
Government of Lebanon and those of the Member States, regional and international

organizations, regional and international financial institutions, non-governmental 
organizations and the private sector in the initiation of clean-up and rehabilitation 
operations on the polluted shores, and encourages the Member States and the above-
mentioned entities to continue their financial and technical support to the 
Government of Lebanon towards achieving the completion of clean-up and 
rehabilitation operations, with the aim of preserving the ecosystem of Lebanon and 
that of the Eastern Mediterranean Basin; 

 7. Welcomes the agreement of the Lebanon Recovery Fund to host the 
Eastern Mediterranean Oil Spill Restoration Trust Fund, based on voluntary 
contributions, to provide assistance and support to the States directly adversely 
affected in their integrated environmentally sound management, from clean-up to 
safe disposal of oily waste, of this environmental disaster resulting from the 
destruction of the oil storage tanks at Jiyeh electric power plant; 

 8. Invites States, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental 
organizations and the private sector to make voluntary financial contributions to the 
Trust Fund, and in this regard requests the Secretary-General to mobilize 
international technical and financial assistance, in order to ensure that the Trust 
Fund has sufficient and adequate resources, since Lebanon is still engaged in the 
treatment of wastes and the monitoring of recovery;  

 9. Recognizes the multidimensionality of the adverse impact of the oil slick, 
and requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its sixty-
sixth session a report on the implementation of the present resolution under the item 
entitled “Sustainable development”.
