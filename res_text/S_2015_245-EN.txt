within the authority of the legitimate Government of Yemen, and noting that such 

actions are unacceptable, 

 Expressing alarm that such actions taken by the Houthis undermine the 

political transition process in Yemen, and jeopardize the security, stability, 

sovereignty and unity of Yemen,  

 Noting with concern the destabilizing actions taken by the former President of 

Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh, including supporting the Houthis’ actions, which 

continue to undermine the peace, security and stability of Yemen,  

 Welcoming the intention of the Gulf Cooperation Council to convene a

  Annex 
 

 

1. Abdulmalik al-Houthi  

 Abdul Malik al Houthi is a leader of a group that has engaged in acts that 

threaten the peace, security, or stability of Yemen.  

 In September 2014, Houthi forces captured Sanaa and in January 2015 they 

attempted to unilaterally replace the legitimate government of Yemen with an 

illegitimate governing authority that the Houthis dominated. Al -Houthi 

assumed the leadership of Yemen’s Houthi movement in 2004 after the death 

of his brother, Hussein Badredden al-Houthi. As leader of the group, al-Houthi 

has repeatedly threatened Yemeni authorities with further unrest if they do not 

respond to his demands and detained President Hadi, Prime Minister, and key 

cabinet members. Hadi subsequently escaped to Aden. The Houthis then 

launched another offensive towards Aden assisted by military units loyal to 

former president Saleh and his son, Ahmed Ali Saleh.  

2. Ahmed Ali Abdullah Saleh 

 Ahmed Ali Saleh has engaged in acts that threaten the peace, security, and 

stability of Yemen. 

 Ahmed Ali Saleh has been working to undermine President Hadi ’s authority, 

thwart Hadi’s attempts to reform the military, and hinder Yemen’s peaceful 

transition to democracy. Saleh played a key role in facilitating the Houthi 

military expansion. As of mid-February 2013, Ahmed Ali Saleh had issued 

thousands of new rifles to Republican Guard brigades and unidentified tribal 

shaykhs. The weapons were originally procured in 2010 and reserved to 

purchase the loyalties of the recipients for political gain at a later date.  

 After Saleh’s father, former Republic of Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh, 

stepped down as President of Yemen in 2011, Ahmed Ali Saleh retained his 

post as commander of Yemen’s Republican Guard. A little over a year later, 

Saleh was dismissed by President Hadi but he retained significant influence 

within the Yemeni military, even after he was removed from command. Ali 

Abdullah Saleh was designated by the UN under UNSCR 2140 in November 

2014.
