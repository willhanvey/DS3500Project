efforts of the Connnis s ioner-General to collect additional contTibutions u this
increased level of income to the United l{ations Relief and tr{orks Agency for

6. Cal-ls upon afI Governments as a matter of urgency to rnake the most
generous efforts possible to meet the anticipated needs of the United lTations Relief

of the budgetary deficits projected in the Comrnis s ioner-Generaf rs report, and
therefore urges non- contributing Governments to contribute regularly and
contributing Governments to ccnsider increasing their regular contributions.
