3/9 16-19901 

 

 Recalling that the seventy-first session of the General Assembly coincides 

with the seventieth anniversary of the Judgment of the Nuremberg Tribunal,  

 Mindful of the horrors of the Second World War, and stressing in this regard 

that the victory over Nazism in the Second World War contributed to establishing 

the conditions for the creation of the United Nations, designed to prevent future 

wars and save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,  

 1. Reaffirms the relevant provisions of the Durban Declaration
9
 and of the 

outcome document of the Durban Review Conference,
10

 in which States condemned 

the persistence and resurgence of neo-Nazism, neo-Fascism and violent nationalist 

ideologies based on racial and national prejudice and stated that those phenomena 

could never be justified in any instance or in any circumstances;  

 2. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Special Rapporteur of 

the Human Rights Council on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 

xenophobia and related intolerance, prepared in accordance with the request 

contained in General Assembly resolution 70/139;
11

  

 3. Expresses its appreciation to the United Nations High Commissioner for 

Human Rights and his Office for their efforts to fight racism, racial discrimination, 

xenophobia and related intolerance, including the maintenance by the Office  of the 

United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights of the database on practical 

means to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance;  

 4. Expresses deep concern about the glorification, in any form, of the Nazi 

movement, neo-Nazism and former members of the Waffen SS organization, 

including by erecting monuments and memorials and holding public demonstrations 

in the name of the glorification of the Nazi past, the Nazi movement and 

neo-Nazism, as well as by declaring or attempting to declare such members and 

those who fought against the anti-Hitler coalition and collaborated with the Nazi 

movement participants in national liberation movements;  

 5. Calls for the universal ratification and effective implementation of the 

International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,
3
 

and encourages those States parties that have not yet done so to consider making  the 

declaration under its article 14, thus providing the Committee on the Elimination of 

Racial Discrimination with the competence to receive and consider communications 

from individuals or groups of individuals within their jurisdiction claiming to be 

victims of a violation by a State party of any of the rights set forth in the 

Convention;  

 6. Emphasizes once more the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur 

that “any commemorative celebration of the Nazi regime, its allies and related 

organizations, whether official or unofficial, should be prohibited by States”,
12

 also 

emphasizes that such manifestations do injustice to the memory of the countless 

victims of the Second World War and negatively influence children and young 

people, and stresses in this regard that it is important that States take measures, in 

accordance with international human rights law, to counteract any celebration of the 

Nazi SS organization and all its integral parts, including the Waffen SS, and that

failure by States to effectively address such practices is incompatible with the 

obligations of States Members of the United Nations under its Charter;  

 7. Expresses concern about recurring attempts to desecrate or demolish 

monuments erected in remembrance of those who fought against Nazism during the 

Second World War, as well as to unlawfully exhume or remove the remains of such 

persons, and in this regard urges States to fully comply with their relevant 

obligations, inter alia, under article 34 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva 

Conventions of 1949;
13

  

 8. Notes with concern the increase in the number of racist incidents 

worldwide, including the rise of skinhead groups, which have been responsible for 

many of these incidents, as well as the resurgence of racist and xenophobic violence 

targeting, inter alia, persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic 

minorities or on any other grounds, including arson attacks on houses and 

vandalization of schools and places of worship;  

 9. Reaffirms that such acts may be qualified as falling within the scope of 

the Convention, that they may not be justified when they fa ll outside the scope of 

the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association as well as the rights to 

freedom of expression and that they may fall within the scope of article 20 of the 

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
2
 and may be subject to certain 

restrictions, as set out in articles 19, 21 and 22 of the Covenant;  

 10. Encourages States to take concrete measures, including legislative and 

educational ones, in order to prevent the denial of the crimes against humanity and 

war crimes committed during the Second World War;  

 11. Condemns without reservation any denial of or attempt to deny the 

Holocaust, as well as any manifestation of religious intolerance, incitement, 

harassment or violence against persons or communities on the basis of ethnic origin 

or religious belief;  

 12. Welcomes the call of the Special Rapporteur for the active preservation of 

those Holocaust sites that served as Nazi death camps, concentration and forced 

labour camps and prisons, as well as his encouragement of States to take measures, 

including legislative, law enforcement and educational measures, to put an end to all 

forms of Holocaust denial;
14

  

 13. Calls upon States to continue to take adequate steps, including through 

national legislation, in accordance with international human rights law, aimed at the 

prevention of hate speech and incitement to violence against persons in vulnerable 

situations; 

 14. Expresses deep concern about attempts at commercial advertising aimed 

at exploiting the sufferings of the victims of war crimes and crimes against 

humanity committed during the Second World War by the Nazi regime;  

 15. Stresses that the practices described above do injustice to the memory of 

the countless victims of crimes against humanity committed in the Second World 

War, in particular those committed by the SS organization and by those who fought

against the anti-Hitler coalition and collaborated with the Nazi movement, and may 

negatively influence children and young people, and that failure by States to 

effectively address such practices is incompatible with the obligations of States 

Members of the United Nations under its Charter, including those related to the 

purposes and principles of the Organization;  

 16. Also stresses that such practices fuel contemporary forms of racism, 

racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and contribute to the 

spread and multiplication of various extremist political parties, movements and 

groups, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and in this regard calls for 

increased vigilance; 

 17. Expresses concern that the human rights and democratic challenges 

posed by extremist political parties, movements and groups are universal and no 

country is immune to them;  

 18. Emphasizes the need to take the measures necessary to put an end to the 

practices described above, and calls upon States and all other stakeholders to take 

more effective measures in accordance with international human rights law to 

prevent and combat those phenomena and extremist movements, which pose a real 

threat to democratic values, and to increase their vigilance and strengthen their 

efforts to recognize and effectively address those challenges;  

 19. Underlines the importance of data and statistics on racist and xenophobic 

crimes for identifying the types of offences committed, the profiles of victims and 

of perpetrators and whether they are affiliated with extremist movements or groups, 

thus enhancing better understanding of the phenomenon and identifying effective  

measures to address such racist and xenophobic crimes;  

 20. Encourages States to adopt further measures to provide training for the 

police and other law enforcement bodies on the ideologies of extremist political 

parties, movements and groups whose advocacy constitutes incitement to racist and 

xenophobic violence, to strengthen their capacity to address racist and xenophobic 

crimes, to fulfil their responsibility for bringing to justice the perpetrators of such 

crimes and to combat impunity; 

 21. Expresses deep concern about the increased number of seats occupied by 

representatives of extremist parties of a racist or xenophobic character in a number 

of national and local parliaments, and emphasizes in this regard the need for all 

democratic political parties to base their programmes and activities on respect for 

human rights and freedoms, democracy, the rule of law and good governance and to 

condemn all messages disseminating ideas that are based on racial superiority or 

hatred and that have the objective of fuelling contemporary forms of racism, racial 

discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; 

 22. Notes with appreciation in this regard the call of the Special Rapporteur 

on political leaders and parties to strongly condemn incitement to racial 

discrimination or xenophobia, to promote tolerance and respect and to refra in from 

forming coalitions with extremist parties of a racist or xenophobic character;
15

16-19901 6/9 

 

 23. Expresses concern that ethnic profiling and police violence against 

persons in vulnerable situations discourage victims from seeking redress owing to 

distrust of the legal system, and in this regard encourages States to improve 

diversity within law enforcement agencies and to impose appropriate sanctions 

against those within the public service found guilty of racially motivated violence or 

of using hate speech; 

 24. Expresses deep concern about the increase in reported cases of racist and 

xenophobic manifestations during sports events, including those committed by 

extremist groups, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and calls upon States, 

sports federations and other relevant stakeholders to strengthen measures to prevent 

such incidents, while also welcoming the steps that many States, sports federations 

and clubs have taken to eliminate racism at sporting events, including through sport 

practised without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which 

require human understanding, tolerance, fair play and solidarity;  

 25. Recalls the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur to introduce into 

national criminal law a provision according to which committing an offence with 

racist or xenophobic motivations or aims constitutes an aggravating circumstance, 

allowing for enhanced penalties,
16

 and encourages those States whose legislation 

does not contain such provisions to consider that recommendation;  

 26. Notes measures taken by States to prevent discrimination against , in 

particular, persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic 

minorities, people of African descent, Roma, migrants, refugees, asylum seekers, 

and to ensure their integration into society, and urges States to ensure the full and 

effective implementation of legal, policy and institutional measures protecting these 

individuals and groups, and recommends that States effectively guarantee to these 

individuals and groups, without discrimination of any kind, their human rights, 

including the right to safety and security, access to justice, adequate reparation and 

appropriate information about their rights, as well as the prosecution and adequate 

sanctioning of those responsible for racist and xenophobic crimes against them;  

 27. Underlines that the roots of extremism are multifaceted and must be 

addressed through adequate measures such as education, awareness -raising and the 

promotion of dialogue, and in this regard recommends the increase of measures to 

raise awareness among young people of the dangers of the ideologies and activities 

of extremist political parties, movements and groups;  

 28. Reaffirms, in this regard, the particular importance of all forms of 

education, including human rights education, as a complement to legislative 

measures, and calls upon States to continue to invest in education, in both 

conventional and non-conventional curricula, inter alia, in order to transform 

attitudes and counteract ideas of racial hierarchies and superiority, and counter their 

negative influence, and to promote the values of non-discrimination, equality and 

respect for all, as outlined by the Special Rapporteur;  

 29. Emphasizes the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur presented at 

the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly, in which he emphasized the

importance of history classes in teaching the dramatic events and human suffering 

which arose out of the adoption of ideologies such as Nazism and Fascism;
17

  

 30. Stresses the importance of other positive measures and initiatives aimed 

at bringing communities together and providing them with space for genuine 

dialogue, such as round tables, working groups and seminars, including training 

seminars for State agents and media professionals, as well as awareness-raising 

activities, especially those initiated by civil society representatives, which require 

continued State support; 

 31. Underlines the positive role that relevant United Nations entities and 

programmes, in particular the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 

Organization, can play in the aforementioned areas;  

 32. Reaffirms article 4 of the Convention, according to which States parties 

condemn all propaganda and all organizations which are based on ideas or theor ies 

of superiority of one race or group of persons of one colour or ethnic origin, or 

which attempt to justify or promote racial hatred and discrimination in any form, 

and undertake to adopt immediate and positive measures designed to eradicate all 

incitement to, or acts of, such discrimination and, to this end, with due regard to the 

principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
1
 and the rights 

expressly set forth in article 5 of the Convention, inter alia:  

 (a) Shall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas 

based on racial superiority or hatred, and incitement to racial discrimination, as well 

as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of 

persons of another colour or ethnic origin, and also the provision of any assistance 

to racist activities, including the financing thereof;  

 (b) Shall declare illegal and prohibit organizations, and also organized and 

all other propaganda activities, which promote and incite racial discrimination, and 

shall recognize participation in such organizations or activities as an offence 

punishable by law; 

 (c) Shall not permit public authorities or public institutions, national or 

local, to promote or incite racial discrimination;  

 33. Also reaffirms that, as underlined in paragraph 13 of the outcome 

document of the Durban Review Conference, any advocacy of national, racial or 

religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence 

should be prohibited by law, that all dissemination of ideas based on racial 

superiority or hatred, or incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts of 

violence or incitement to such acts, shall be declared offences punishable by law, in 

accordance with the international obligations of States, and that these prohibitions 

are consistent with freedom of opinion and expression;  

 34. Recognizes the positive role that the exercise of the right to freedom of 

opinion and expression, as well as full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and 

impart information, including through the Internet, can play in combating racism, 

racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance;

 35. Expresses concern about the increased use of the Internet to promote and 

disseminate racism, racial hatred, xenophobia, racial discrimination and related 

intolerance, and in this regard calls upon States parties to the International Covenant 

on Civil and Political Rights to counter the dissemination of the above -mentioned 

ideas while respecting their obligations under articles 19 and 20 of the Covenant, 

which guarantee the right to freedom of expression and outline the grounds on 

which the exercise of this right can be legitimately restricted;  

 36. Recognizes the need to promote the use of new information and 

communications technologies, including the Internet, to contribute to the fight 

against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance;  

 37. Also recognizes the positive role that the media can play in combating 

racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, promoting a 

culture of tolerance and representing the diversity of a multicultural society;  

 38. Encourages States, civil society and other relevant stakeholders to use all 

opportunities, including those provided by the Internet and social media, to counter, 

in accordance with international human rights law, the dissemination of ideas based 

on racial superiority or hatred and to promote the values of equality, 

non-discrimination, diversity and democracy;  

 39. Encourages those States that have made reservations to article 4 of the 

Convention to give serious consideration to withdrawing such reservations as a 

matter of priority, as stressed by the Special Rapporteur;  

 40. Notes the importance of strengthening cooperation at the regional and 

international levels with the aim of countering all manifestations of racism, racial 

discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, in particular regarding issues 

raised in the present resolution; 

 41. Stresses the importance of cooperating closely with civil society and 

international and regional human rights mechanisms in order to counter effectively 

all manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 

intolerance, as well as extremist political parties, movements and groups, including 

neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and other similar extremist ideological movements 

that incite racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance;  

 42. Encourages States parties to the Convention to ensure that their 

legislation incorporates the provisions of the Convention, including those of article 4;  

 43. Encourages States to adopt the legislation necessary to combat racism 

while ensuring that the definition of racial discrimination set out therein complies 

with article 1 of the Convention; 

 44. Recalls that any legislative or constitutional measures adopted with a
