its finding that the main parties to the conflict, including ex-Seleka, the anti-Balaka, 

and elements from the CAR Armed Forces (FACA) who collaborated with armed 

groups committed violations of international humanitarian law and human rights 

violations and abuses since 1 January 2013, that may amount to war crimes and 

crimes against humanity, including ethnic cleansing by elements of the anti -Balaka 

militia,  

 Condemning in the strongest terms all attacks, provocations and incitement to 

violence against the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization 

Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) contingents and other 

international forces by armed groups or other perpetrators, paying tribute to the 

personnel of MINUSCA who sacrificed their lives in the service of peace, 

underlining that attacks targeting peacekeepers may constitute war crimes, 

reminding all parties of their obligations under international humanitarian law and 

urging the CAR Authorities to take all possible measures to ensure the arrest and 

prosecution of perpetrators,  

 Welcoming in this regard MINUSCA’s efforts to protect civilians and to

by peacekeepers in the CAR, as well as by non-United Nations forces, stressing the 

urgent need for T/PCCs and, as appropriate, MINUSCA, to promptly investigate

need to prevent such exploitation and abuse and to improve how these allegations 

are addressed in line with resolution 2272 (2016),
