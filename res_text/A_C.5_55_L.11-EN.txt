Agenda item 138 (b)
Financing of the United Nations peacekeeping forces in the
Middle East: United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon

Draft resolution submitted by Nigeria*

Financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon

The General Assembly,

Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon1 and the related report of the Advisory
Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 425 (1978) of 19 March 1978, by
which the Council established the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, and the
subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended the mandate of the Force, the
latest of which was resolution 1310 (2000) of 27 July 2000,

Recalling its resolution S-8/2 of 21 April 1978 on the financing of the Force
and its subsequent resolutions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 54/267 of
15 June 2000,

Reaffirming its resolutions 51/233 of 13 June 1997, 52/237 of 26 June 1998,
53/227 of 8 June 1999 and 54/267,

Reaffirming also that the costs of the Force are expenses of the Organization to
be borne by Member Sates in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the
Charter of the United Nations,

Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the
expenditures caused by the Force, a different procedure is required from that applied
to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries
are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically
less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards
such an operation,

Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the permanent members of the
Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27
June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the
Force,

Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Force with the necessary
financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant
resolutions of the Security Council,

Concerned that the Secretary-General continues to face difficulties in meeting
the obligations of the Force on a current basis, including reimbursement to current
and former troop-contributing States,

Concerned also that the surplus balances in the Special Account for the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon have been used to meet expenses of the Force in
order to compensate for the lack of income resulting from non-payment and late
payment by Member States of their contributions,

1. Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Interim
Force in Lebanon as at 31 October 2000, including the contributions outstanding
in the amount of 139.4 million United States dollars, representing some 3.9 per
cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Force to the
period ending 31 December 2000, notes that some 21 per cent of the Member
States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member
States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure the payment of their
outstanding assessed contributions;

2. Express its deep concern that Israel did not comply with General
Assembly resolutions 51/233, 52/237, 53/227 and 54/267;

3. Stresses once again that Israel should strictly abide by General Assembly
resolutions 51/233, 52/237, 53/227 and 54/267;

4. Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their
assessed contributions in full;

5. Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to
peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursements to troop
contributors that bear additional burdens owing to overdue payments by Member
States of their assessments;

6. Urges all Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment
of their assessed contributions to the Force in full and on time;

7. Expresses concern at the delay experienced by the Secretary-General in
deploying and providing adequate resources to some recent peacekeeping
missions, in particular those in Africa;

given equal and non-discriminatory treatment in respect of financial and
administrative arrangements;

mandates;

10. Requests the Secretary-General to make the fullest possible use of
facilities and equipment at the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy, in
order to minimize the costs of procurement for the Force, and for this purpose
requests the Secretary-General to speed up the implementation of the asset
management system at all peacekeeping missions in accordance with General
Assembly resolution 52/1 A of 15 October 1997;

11. Endorses the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of
the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;2

12. Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that
the Force is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;

13. Also requests the Secretary-General, in order to reduce the cost of
employing General Service staff, to continue efforts to recruit local staff for the
Force against General Service posts, commensurate with the requirements of the
Force;

14. Reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to take the necessary
measures to ensure the full implementation of paragraph 8 of General Assembly
resolution 51/233 and paragraph 5 of resolution 52/237, paragraph 11 of resolution
53/227 and paragraph 14 of 54/267, stresses once again that Israel shall pay the
amount of 1,284,633 dollars resulting from the incident at Qana on 18 April 1996,
and requests the Secretary-General to report on this matter to the Assembly at its
resumed fifty-fifth session;

15. Decides to appropriate to the Special Account for the United Nations
