democratic process of government by ensuring that the upcoming presidential and
legislative elections are peaceful, transparent, free and fair;

6. Authorizes a temporary increase in UNMIL’s personnel ceiling, to a total
of 15,250 United Nations military personnel, for the period from 15 November 2005

conclude an agreement regarding the status of military personnel of UNMIL
deployed to Sierra Leone pursuant to this resolution, taking into account General
Assembly resolution 59/47 on the scope of legal protection under the Convention on
the Safety and Security of United Nations and Associated Personnel, and decides
that, pending the conclusion of such an agreement, the model status-of-forces
agreement dated 9 October 1990 (A/45/594) shall apply provisionally;

11. Encourages the United Nations missions in the region, within their
capabilities and areas of deployment and without prejudice to their mandates, to
continue their efforts towards enhancing intermission cooperation, especially with
regard to the prevention of cross-border movement of arms, combatants and the
illicit exploitation of natural resources and in the implementation of disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration programmes;

12. Welcomes the efforts undertaken by UNMIL to implement the Secretary-
General’s zero tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and to ensure full
compliance of its personnel with the United Nations code of conduct, and requests
the Secretary-General to take all necessary action in this regard and to keep the
Security Council informed, and urges troop-contributing countries to take
appropriate preventive action, including the conduct of predeployment awareness
training, and to take disciplinary action and other action to ensure that allegations of
sexual exploitation or abuse against their personnel are properly investigated and, if
substantiated, punished;
