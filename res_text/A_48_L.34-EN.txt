45/83 C of 13 December 1990, 46/82 B of 16 December 1991 and 47/63 B of
11 December 1992, in which it determined that all legislative and administrative
measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which had altered or
purported to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem, in
particular the so-called "Basic Law" on Jerusalem and the proclamation of
Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, were null and void and must be rescinded
forthwith,

Recalling Security Council resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980, in
which the Council, inter alia, decided not to recognize the "Basic Law" and
called upon those States that had established diplomatic missions at Jerusalem
to withdraw such missions from the Holy City,

Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of ... 1993,

1. Determines that Israel’s decision to impose its laws, jurisdiction and
administration on the Holy City of Jerusalem is illegal and therefore null and
void and has no validity whatsoever;

2. Deplores the transfer by some States of their diplomatic missions to
Jerusalem in violation of Security Council resolution 478 (1980), and their
refusal to comply with the provisions of that resolution;
