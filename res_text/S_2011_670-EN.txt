and the statements of its Presidents S/PRST/2005/7 and S/PRST/2010/6, 

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial 
integrity and national unity of Libya, 

 Stressing that national ownership and national responsibility are key to 
establishing sustainable peace in Libya,  

 Stressing also the importance of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya, 
in accordance with its mandate under resolution 2009 (2011), assisting and 
supporting Libyan national efforts, inter alia to restore public security and order, 

 Recalling that, pursuant to paragraph 10 of resolution 1970 (2011), Member 
States are obliged to prohibit the procurement of all arms and related materiel from 
Libya by their nationals, or using their flagged vessels or aircraft, and whether or 
not originating in the territory of Libya, 

 Expressing concern at the proliferation of all arms and related materiel of all 
types, in particular man-portable surface-to-air missiles, from Libya, in the region 
and its potential impact on regional and international peace and security, 

 Underlining the risk of destabilization posed by the dissemination in the Sahel 
region of illicit small arms and light weapons, and recalling in that regard the 
Report of the Secretary-General on the activities of the United Nations Office for 
West Africa (S/2011/388), which, inter alia calls for strengthened cooperation in the 
Sahel area, as well as the work of the United Nation Office for Central Africa, 

 Recognizing the urgent need for additional efforts to be made at the national, 
regional and international levels, in order to prevent the proliferation of all arms and 
related materiel of all types, in particular man-portable surface-to-air missiles, in the 
region, 

 Recognizing also the urgent need to secure and destroy chemical weapons 
stockpiles in Libya, in accordance with its international obligations,

11-57315 2

threats to international peace and security, 

 Reiterating the obligation of Member States to cooperate in order to prevent 
the movement of terrorist groups, and the proliferation of arms in support of 
terrorist activities, inter alia through effective border control, 

 Mindful of its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace 
and security, 

 1. Calls upon the Libyan authorities to take all necessary steps to prevent 
the proliferation of all arms and related materiel of all types, in particular man-
portable surface-to-air missiles, to ensure their proper custody, as well as to meet 
Libya’s arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation obligations under 
international law, through the full implementation of their plans in this regard;

coordination with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, with

with assistance from its Panel of Experts, and in cooperation with the Counter 
Terrorism Executive Directorate, and working with other relevant UN bodies

international and regional organizations and entities, to assess the threats and 
challenges, in particular related to terrorism, posed by the proliferation of all arms 
and related materiel of all types, in particular man-portable surface-to-air missiles, 
from Libya, in the region, and to submit a report to the Council on proposals to 
counter this threat, and to prevent the proliferation of arms and related materiel, 
including, inter alia, measures to secure these arms and related materiel, to ensure 
that stockpiles are managed safely and securely, to strengthen border control and to 
enhance transport security; 

 6. Requests the Secretary-General to include in his reports pursuant to 
resolution 2009 (2011) to the Security Council updates on the implementation of 
this resolution;
