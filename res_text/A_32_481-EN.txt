DRAFT RESOLUTION I

Action programme in favour--'2.f-"developinp, island countries

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolutions 3338 (XXIX) of 17 December 1974 and 3362 (S-VII) of

Recalling resolution 98 (IV) of 31 May 1976 of the United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development, 6/ in which a series of special measures and specific
action~ respectively~ in f~vour of the least developed countries and in favour of
the land-locked and island developing countries were recommended~

Recalling also resolution 31/156 of 21 December 1976, in which the General
Assembly called upon the Secretary-General to submit, through the Economic and
Social Council, a progress report on the implementation of specific action in
favour of developing island countries,

Recalling further Economic and Social Council resolution 2126 (LXIII) of
4 August 1977, in which the Council reco~~ended that the General Assembly at its
thirty-second session should give full consideration to the progress report of the

need for specific action in favour of developing island countries,

supplementary to the general measures applicable to all developing countries, is
required to meet these particular impediments,

implementation of specific action in favour of developing island countries 1/ and
welcomes the initiation of the measures specified therein;

Development Organization in its implementation of the special technical assistance
programme for developing island countries;

Concerned that !!'~any developinG countric-s are experiencing extreme difficulties
in servicing their external debts and are unable to pur~ue or initiate ili~ortant
development projects) that the growth perfcrmcDce of the most seriously affecte~
least developed~ land-locked and island developing countries duriD2 the first

available at high interest rates and on short maturities,

~e~retting that so far most developed countries have not been prepared to
assist in resolving the immediate difficulties of those developing countries
suffering from the effects of heavy debt burdens or to consider the debt question
in the perspective of development rather than co~merce,

l{oting that the Special Action Proc;ramme of Cl billion offered by the

reach satisfactory decisions on:

(a) Generalized debt relief by the developed countries on the official
debt of developing countries) in particular of the most seriously affected, least
developed~ 18ilu-locked and island developing countries, in the context of the call
for a substantial increase in net official development assistance flows to
developing countries~

(b) Beorga:C11zation of the entire system of debt renegotiation to give it a
developnental orientation so ~s to result in adequate) equitable and consistent
debt reorsanizations;

(c) The problems created by the inadequate access of the majority of
developing countries to international capital markets, in particular the danger of
the blli~ching of repayments caused by the short maturities of such loans;

3. Uelcomes the steps taken by some developed countries to cancel official
debts owed to -::'hem by certain developing countries and the decision to extend
future official development assistance in favour of the most seriously affected
countries and t~e least developed of the developing countries in the form of
grants ~ 3.l1d urges that this be followed by similar decisions by other developed
countries;

from the "brain drain", should, in the light of the studies assessing the
ma(nitude~ composition, causes and effects of the outflow of trained personnel

measures Iilight be necessary to deal with the problems posed by such outflow,

Conscious that the development process of the developing countries,
particularly their capacity to strengthen their domestic technological potential,
is crucially dependent on the supply of highly trained personnel, and that the
outflow of such personnel represents a significant loss to those countries,

Ta~,in,cC: into account the fact that a Group of Governmental Experts on Reverse
Transfer of Technology will be convened by the Secretary-General of the United

International Labour Organisation, on 10 June 1977, concerning the establishment
of an international labour compensatory facility to compensate labour-exporting
countries for their loss of highly trained personnel,

1. Recommends that Hember States concerned and the competent international
organizations Should, as a matter of urgency, give due consideration to the
formulation of policies with a view to mitigating the adverse consequences
associated 'i.Tith the "brain drain'!:.

2. Urges developing countries to make a thorough evaluation at the
national level of the special characteristics of the f'brain-drainH prOblem;

3. Also urges the developing countries to give immediate consideration
to the rrodalities for promoting collective self-reliance among themselves with
a view to using and developing their human resources on the basis of mutual
advantage within the broader framework of co-operation in the field of trade,
technology and capital,
