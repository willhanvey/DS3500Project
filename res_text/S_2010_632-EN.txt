 The Security Council, 

 Noting the letter from the Prime Minister of Iraq to the President of the 
Security Council, dated 9 December 2010, which is annexed to this resolution, 

 Recognizing the positive developments in Iraq and that the situation now 
existing in Iraq is significantly different from that which existed at the time of the 
adoption of resolution 661 (1990), recognizing that Iraqi institutions are 
strengthening, and further recognizing the importance of Iraq achieving 
international standing equal to that which it held prior to the adoption of resolution 
661 (1990), 

 Welcomes the letter from the Prime Minister of Iraq which reaffirms the 
commitment by the Government of Iraq not to request any further extensions of the 
Development Fund for Iraq arrangements; and recognizing that the letter from the 
Prime Minister of Iraq also reaffirms the commitment by the Government to ensure 
that oil revenue would continue to be used fairly and in the interests of the Iraqi 
people, and that transition arrangements would be in keeping with the constitution 
and with international best practices in respect of transparency, accountability and 
integrity,  

 Recognizing the significant role of the Development Fund for Iraq and the 
International Advisory and Monitoring Board, and the provisions of paragraphs 20 
and 22 of resolution 1483 (2003) in helping the Government of Iraq to ensure that 
Iraq’s resources are being used transparently and accountably for the benefit of the 
Iraqi people, and stressing also the need for Iraq to finalize transition to successor 
arrangements for the Development Fund for Iraq and the International Advisory and 
Monitoring Board, 

 Acting under chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 

 1. Decides to terminate, on 30 June 2011, the arrangements established in 
paragraph 20 of resolution 1483 (2003) for depositing into the Development Fund 
for Iraq proceeds from export sales of petroleum, petroleum products and natural 
gas and the arrangements referred to in paragraph 12 of resolution 1483 (2003) and 
paragraph 24 of resolution 1546 (2004) for the monitoring of the Development Fund 
for Iraq by the International Advisory and Monitoring Board and further decides that, 



S/2010/632  
 

10-69562 2 
 

subject to the exception provided for in paragraph 27 of resolution 1546 (2004), the 
provisions of paragraph 22 of resolution 1483 (2003) shall continue to apply until 
that date, including with respect to funds and financial assets and economic 
resources described in paragraph 23 of that resolution; 

 2. Welcomes and affirms the Government of Iraq’s decision not to request 
any further extensions of the Development Fund for Iraq arrangements; and further 
decides this is the final extension of the Development Fund for Iraq arrangements; 

 3. Decides that after 30 June 2011, the requirement established in paragraph 
20 of UNSCR 1483 (2003) that all proceeds from export sales of petroleum, 
petroleum products and natural gas from Iraq be deposited into the Development 
Fund for Iraq shall no longer apply, and affirms that the requirement established in 
paragraph 21 of UNSCR 1483 (2003) that 5 percent of the proceeds from all export 
sales of petroleum, petroleum products and natural gas shall be deposited into the 
compensation fund established in accordance with resolution 687 (1991), and 
subsequent resolutions, shall continue to apply, and further decides that 5 percent of 
the value of any non-monetary payments of petroleum, petroleum products and 
natural gas made to service providers shall be deposited into the compensation fund, 
and that unless the Government of Iraq and the governing council of the United 
Nations Compensation Commission, in the exercise of its authority over methods of 
ensuring that payments are made into the compensation fund, decide otherwise, the 
above requirements shall be binding on the Government of Iraq; 

 4. Calls upon the Government of Iraq to work closely with the Secretary-
General to finalize the full and effective transition to a post-Development Fund 
mechanism by or before 30 June 2011, which takes into account IMF stand-by 
arrangement requirements, includes external auditing arrangements and ensures that 
Iraq will continue to meet its obligations as established in the provisions of 
paragraph 21 of resolution 1483 (2003); further requests that the Government of 
Iraq provide a written report to the council no later than 1 May 2011 on progress 
towards the transition to a post-Development Fund mechanism; 

 5. Directs the transfer of the full proceeds from the Development Fund for 
Iraq to the Government of Iraq’s successor arrangements account or accounts and 
the termination of the Development Fund for Iraq no later than 30 June 2011 and 
requests written confirmation to the Council once the transfer and termination are 
completed; 

 6. Requests the Secretary-General to provide written reports on an ongoing 
basis to the council every six months, with the first report due no later than  
1 January 2012, about the United Nations compensation fund, evaluating the 
continued compliance with the provisions of paragraph 21 of resolution 1483 
(2003); 

 7. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.

Annex 
Letter dated 8 December 2010 from the Prime Minister of Iraq 
addressed to the President of the Security Council 
 
 I should like to refer to my letter dated 13 December 2009 addressed to the 
President of the Security Council, in which I explained that in 2010 the Government 
of Iraq would put in place appropriate arrangements, in keeping with the 
Constitution, for the Development Fund for Iraq and the International Advisory and 
Monitoring Board, with a view to ensuring the continued equitable use of oil 
revenue in the interests of the Iraqi people, in accordance with international best 
practices with regard to transparency, accountability and integrity. 

 Pursuant to Security Council resolution 1905 (2009), the Government of Iraq 
submitted in its first quarterly report the requisite action plan and timeline for the 
transition to the successor arrangements for the Development Fund for Iraq and the 
International Advisory and Monitoring Board. It subsequently submitted its second 
and third reports on the progress that had been made. In the third report, details 
were given of the parts of the action plan that had been completed and those that 
remained incomplete. Reference was also made to the situation in Iraq and the fact 
that the delay in the formation of a new Government after the legislative elections 
that took place on 7 March 2010 had, in one way or another, affected the ability of 
Government institutions to take rapid and effective action with regard to the 
comprehensive implementation of the action plan. 

 On the basis of the foregoing, and in order to make it possible to ensure the 
comprehensive implementation of the action plan and a smooth transition to the 
successor arrangements, the Government of Iraq is once more in need of the 
assistance of the international community. It therefore hopes that the Security 
Council will extend for a further and final six months immunity for the 
Development Fund for Iraq, on the basis of the arrangements set forth in Security 
Council resolution 1483 (2003), paragraph 20.  

 I should be grateful if you would circulate this letter to the members of the 
Council with the greatest possible expedition and include it as an annex to the 
resolution currently being drafted on Iraq. 
 
 

(Signed) Nuri Kamel al-Maliki 
Prime Minister of the Republic of Iraq 

Baghdad, December 2010
