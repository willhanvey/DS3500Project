Stressing the commitment made in the Final Document of the 2000 Review

Concerned that the total number of nuclear weapons deployed and in stockpile
still amounts to many thousands,

Reiterating the particular responsibility of the nuclear-weapon States for
transparent, verifiable and irreversible reductions in nuclear weapons leading to
nuclear disarmament,

Emphasizing that further reductions of non-strategic nuclear weapons should
be accorded priority and be carried out in a comprehensive manner,

should be included as an integral part of the nuclear-arms reduction and
disarmament process;

carried out in a transparent, verifiable and irreversible manner;

3. Agrees on the importance of preserving, reaffirming, implementing and
building upon the 1991 and 1992 Presidential Nuclear Initiatives of the United
States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics/Russian Federation
on non-strategic nuclear weapons;

4. Calls upon the Russian Federation and the United States of America to
formalize their Presidential Nuclear Initiatives into legal instruments and to initiate
negotiations on further effectively verifiable reductions of their non-strategic
nuclear weapons;

5. Stresses the importance of special security and physical protection
measures for the transport and storage of non-strategic nuclear weapons, and calls
upon all nuclear-weapon States in possession of such weapons to take the necessary
steps in this regard;

6. Calls for further confidence-building and transparency measures to
reduce the threats posed by non-strategic nuclear weapons;

7. Calls also for concrete agreed measures to further reduce the operational
status of non-strategic nuclear weapons systems;

item entitled “Reduction of non-strategic nuclear weapons”.
