  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 

draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council,  

 Recalling all its previous resolutions and statements of its President on the 

situation in Somalia, 

 Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political 

independence, and unity of Somalia, 

 Welcoming the response of the international community to address instability 

and insecurity in Somalia, and commending the African Union’s leadership of this 

response, 

 Welcoming the progress achieved in Somalia so far, and commending the Somali 

people, the Somali authorities, the African Union, the African Union Mission in 

Somalia (AMISOM) and its troop contributing countries, the United Nations and 

Somalia’s other international partners for their role in this,  

 Reiterating that the immediate and pressing threat to the stability and security 

of Somalia, to the Somali people and to Somalia’s neighbours is posed by Al Shabaab 

and armed opposition groups, condemning in the strongest possible terms their attacks 

in Somalia and beyond, and expressing deep concern at the loss of civilian life from 

these attacks, 

 Paying tribute to the bravery and sacrifices made by AMISOM and Somali 

Security Forces (SSF) personnel in the fight against Al Shabaab, and commending the 

contribution of AMISOM to building lasting peace and stability in Somalia,  

 Welcoming the support provided by the United Nations Support Office in 

Somalia (UNSOS) to AMISOM and the United Nations Assistance Mission in 

Somalia (UNSOM) and recognising the complementary work of the United Nations 

Panel of Experts for Somalia and the role of sanctions imposed by the United Nations 

Security Council, as, amongst other things, a non-military means of degrading Al 

Shabaab, and armed opposition groups, 

 Recognising that the situation in Somalia has evolved since it first authorised 

AMISOM 14 years ago, including the threat posed by Al Shabaab, further recognising 

that military action alone will not overcome this threat, reiterating the need, therefore, 

to pursue an approach that addresses stabilisation and governance challenges, 

including addressing gaps related to public administration, rule of law, combating 

organised crime, justice and law enforcement, and preventing and countering violent 

extremism conducive to terrorism, alongside security sector reform and military

operations, noting in this regard the potential of international cooperation and support 

for peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction and development in Somalia if 

provided in line with priorities defined by its government and further noting in this 

regard African Union Post-Conflict Reconstruction and Development (AUPCRD) 

policy and the AUPCRD dedicated Centre in Cairo,  

 Recalling that the Somali authorities have the primary responsibility for 

ensuring security in their country, welcoming the FGS’s commitment to conduct joint 

operations with AMISOM in order to become the primary security provider in 

Somalia, but noting that Somalia is not yet in a position to take full responsibility for 

its own security and that degrading Al Shabaab and armed opposition groups and 

building and sustaining peace will therefore require continued regional and 

international collaboration and support, stressing that this support should be in-line 

with the direction provided by the Somalia, 

 Emphasising the importance of building the capacity of Somali forces and 

institutions so they are able to manage current and future threats, further emphasising 

the importance of effective coordination between the Federal Government of Somalia 

(FGS) and its Federal Member States (FMS) and international partners in order to 

ensure such capacity building is coherent and aligned with the direction provided by 

Somalia and enables the SSF to assume progressively greater responsibility for 

Somalia’s security, 

 Underlining the critical importance of the FGS and FMS reaching inclusive 

political agreements, expressing concern at the delays in finalising arrangements for 

elections in 2021 and urging them to organise free, fair, credible and inclusive 

elections, in line with the 17 September 2020 agreement, as soon as possible, further 

urging them to collaborate on security and other national priorities, noting the 

responsibilities of all parties to improve cooperation and engage in FGS-led 

discussions, and underscoring that full cooperation of all parties would advance 

progress on national priorities including the implementation of the National Security 

Architecture, revised Somalia Transition Plan, ensuring a fully functioning federal 

system and finalising the constitution as the legal and political foundation for 

Somalia’s government and institutions, 

 Recalling its resolution 1325 (2000) and subsequent resolutions, recognising the 

important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in 

peacebuilding, and stressing the importance of their full, equal and meaningful 

participation and involvement in all efforts at all levels for the maintenance and 

promotion of peace and security, and the need to increase their role in decision-

making and leadership with regard to conflict prevention and resolution as envisaged 

in the Somali Women’s Charter, 

 Condemning violations and abuses of human rights and violations of 

international humanitarian law in Somalia, calling on all parties to act in full 

compliance with their obligations under international human rights law and 

international humanitarian law, and recalling the Working Group Conclusions on 

Children and Armed Conflict in Somalia (S/AC.51/2020/6), 

 Expressing serious concern at the humanitarian situation in Somalia and the 

impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, floods and the desert locust upsurge recognising 

that these present a challenge to Somalia’s health system, agriculture, socio-economic 

situation and humanitarian situation, calling for all parties to the conflict to allow and 

facilitate, in accordance with relevant provisions of international law, including 

applicable international humanitarian law, and in a manner consistent with the United 

Nations guiding principles of humanitarian emergency assistance, including 

humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, the provision of humanitarian 

assistance necessary to support Somalia, noting with appreciation the measures taken

S/2021/243 

 

3/12 21-03443 

 

by AMISOM and the United Nations to ensure the safety and security of AMISOM 

and United Nations personnel whilst maintaining continuity of operations, calling for 

continued efforts to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and locust-infestation, and 

welcoming the role played by AMISOM in supporting Somali-led disaster 

management and relief efforts and their efforts to create conditions conducive to the 

delivery of humanitarian assistance, 

 Emphasising the need for adequate risk assessment and risk management 

strategies by the FGS and the United Nations, of climate change, other ecological 

changes, natural disasters and other factors on the stability of Somalia,  

 Taking note of the United Nations mandated (resolutions 2520 (2020), 2472 

(2019)) Independent Assessment of International Support to the Whole Security 

Environment in Somalia Post-2021 (Independent Assessment) and its 

recommendations, reaffirming paragraph 1 of resolution 2520 (2020) welcomes the 

revised Somalia Transition Plan (STP) (2021), as formally transmitted to the African 

Union and the United Nations in February 2021 and urging Somalia, through the 

Security and Justice Committee, and the African Union, through the Peace and 

Security Council to finalise its endorsement without delay, expressing its full support 

for Somalia’s desire to lead the security transition process, further noting the African 

Union Peace and Security Council’s communiqué of 9 February 2021 on the situation 

in Somalia, and the Secretary-General’s report of 17 February 2021 (S/2021/113) on 

the situation in Somalia and looking forward to the African Union’s independent 

assessment of AMISOM due in May 2021, 

 Recognising its objective of transferring responsibility for security to Somali 

authorities, with the aim of Somalia taking the lead in 2021, and achieving full 

responsibility by the end of 2023, requires a phased approach and that this resolution 

starts a process which will be informed by: 

 (a) the UN mandated Independent Assessment, published in January 2021; 

 (b) the STP, published in February 2021; 

 (c) the African Union’s planned independent assessment due in May 2021;  

 (d) the African Union Peace and Security Council’s decisions also due in May 

2021, the completion of a revised, joint, African Union-FGS Concept of Operations, 

in August 2021 as mandated in paragraph 8 of this resolution;  

 (e) the Secretary-General’s presentation of a proposal for a new mission from 

2022, in September 2021 as mandated in paragraph 9 of this resolution and jointly 

produced by the Secretary-General with the African Union and in consultation with 

the FGS and donors; and 

 (f) the Secretary-General’s presentation of options for continuing United 

Nations logistical support in October 2021, as mandated in paragraph 21 of this 

resolution; 

 and stressing the need for constructive engagement from all relevant 

stakeholders in these activities, 

 Determining that the situation in Somalia continues to constitute a threat to 

regional and international peace and security, 

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  

* 

 1. Reiterates its aspiration that Somalia should be responsible for its own 

security, emphasises that the FGS should lead the security transition process and it 

should effectively start in 2021, welcomes in this regard the STP urges the FGS and

FMS to fully implement their commitments and further urges Somalia’s international 

partners to support Somalia in fulfilling these commitments, including by ensuring 

AMISOM’s strategic tasks and priorities support the transition to Somali 

responsibility for security; 

 2. Recognises the role of the African Union Peace and Security Council, 

takes note of its request that the African Union Commission finalise its independent 

assessment to report in May 2021 and urges it to mandate in May 2021 an AMISOM 

that supports and enables the implementation of the STP and identifies and 

implements the necessary steps in 2021 in order to ensure continued delivery of 

support to Somali security efforts in 2022, including through a reconfigured African 

Union mission, from 2022 that is better able to face the changing threat posed by Al 

Shabaab and armed opposition groups, and is focussed on supporting and enabling 

the SSF to take primary responsibility for security;  

 3. Reiterates that while Al Shabaab remains the most immediate and pressing 

security and stability threat to Somalia, it and armed opposition groups will not be 

defeated by military means alone, and in this regard, urges the FGS and FMS with 

the support of the African Union, the United Nations and international partners to 

work closer together to increase the delivery of non-military activities to address 

Al-Shabaab’s organised crime, illicit finance, access to and trafficking in small arms 

and light weapons, procurement, justice and propaganda activities;  

 4. Underlines the need for Somalia and its partners to take a coordinated and 

cohesive approach towards Somali-led political and security reforms, with all joint 

operations, and strategic and operational decisions, including SSF force generation, 

to ensure transition of security responsibilities agreed between the Somali authorities, 

SSF, and AMISOM from the outset, in coordination with the United Nations and other 

international partners where appropriate, and therefore calls on: 

 (a) The FGS to lead strategic coordination through regular high-level 

meetings of the Somali Transition Plan Strategic Steering Committee supported by 

the Security and Justice Committee (formerly the Comprehensive Approach to 

Security Executive) and the Somalia Development and Reconstruction Facility 

Committee; 

 (b) The FGS, FMS, AMISOM, UNSOM, UNSOS, and international partners 

to increase coordination and collaboration, including by establishing a joint fusion 

cell to plan and deliver integrated strategic operations led by the Somali Government, 

and with support from the African Union, the United Nations and Somalia’s security 

partners, and to conduct joint analysis, joint integrated planning, operational 

coordination and joint performance assessment noting that UNSOS has already 

constructed a suitable facility in Mogadishu and further calls on the FGS, FMS, 

AMISOM, UNSOM, UNSOS and international partners to extend the joint fusion cell 

into the AMISOM sectors; 

 (c) International and regional partners, in coordination with AMISOM, 

UNSOM and through the CAS, to continue to coordinate and better align their support 

with respect to mentoring, training, provision of equipment, capacity building of SSF, 

and remuneration of police and military forces of Somalia including through ensuring 

that all such support and assistance is appropriately notified as required by resolution 

2551 (2020); 

 5. Underscores that the primary responsibility for protecting civilians lies 

with the Somali authorities, further underscores the importance of protecting civilians 

in accordance with international humanitarian law, underlines the need for Somalia 

and its international partners to take into account the security situation in each 

location during transition of security responsibilities to Somalia, emphasises that

planning and decision-making should be guided by a comprehensive assessment of 

the threat to civilians and that proactive measures to mitigate risks should be taken, 

including by establishing an appropriately-sized and qualified SSF presence to ensure 

continued security and protection before, during and after military action, and
