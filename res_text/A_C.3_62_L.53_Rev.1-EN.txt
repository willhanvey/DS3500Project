  The right to food 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling all its previous resolutions on the issue of the right to food, in 
particular resolution 61/163 of 19 December 2006 and resolution 6/2 of the Human 
Rights Council of 27 September 2007,1 as well as all resolutions of the Commission

 Recalling also the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,2 which provides 
that everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for her or his health and 
well-being, including food, the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger 
and Malnutrition3 and the United Nations Millennium Declaration,4 

 Recalling further the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights,5 in which the fundamental right of every person to be 
free from hunger is recognized, 

 Bearing in mind the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World 
Food Summit Plan of Action6 and the Declaration of the World Food Summit: five 
years later, adopted in Rome on 13 June 2002,7 

 Reaffirming the concrete recommendations contained in the Voluntary 
Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in 
the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004,8 

 Bearing in mind paragraph 6 of its resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 

 Reaffirming that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated, and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on 
the same footing and with the same emphasis,  

 Reaffirming also that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and 
economic environment, at both the national and the international levels, is the 
essential foundation that will enable States to give adequate priority to food security 
and poverty eradication, 

 Reiterating, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the 
Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used 
as an instrument of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the 
importance of international cooperation and solidarity, as well as the necessity of 
refraining from unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law 
and the Charter of the United Nations and that endanger food security, 

 Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources 
and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations 
contained in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food 
Summit Plan of Action and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and 
internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food 
security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies 
where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential,

 Recognizing that the problems of hunger and food insecurity have global 
dimensions and that there has been virtually no progress made on reducing hunger 
and that it could increase dramatically in some regions unless urgent, determined 
and concerted action is taken, given the anticipated increase in the world’s 
population and the stress on natural resources,9 

 Noting that environmental degradation, desertification and global climate 
change are exacerbating destitution and desperation, causing a negative impact on 
the realization of the right to food, in particular in developing countries, 

 Expressing its deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters, 
diseases and pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted 
in massive loss of life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and 
food security, in particular in developing countries, 

 Stressing the importance of reversing the continuing decline of official 
development assistance devoted to agriculture, both in real terms and as a share of 
total official development assistance, 

 Welcoming the theme “The right to food”, chosen by the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations to mark World Food Day on 16 October 2007, 

 Taking note of the Final Declaration adopted at the International Conference 
on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development of the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations in Pôrto Alegre, Brazil, on 10 March 2006,10 

 1. Reaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human 
dignity and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, 
regional and international levels for its elimination; 

 2. Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious 
food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of 
everyone to be free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his 
or her physical and mental capacities; 

 3. Considers it intolerable that more than 6 million children still die every 
year from hunger-related illness before their fifth birthday and that there are about 
854 million undernourished people in the world and that, while the prevalence of 
hunger has diminished, the absolute number of undernourished people has been 
increasing in recent years when, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations, the planet could produce enough food to feed 12 billion 
people, twice the world’s present population; 

 4. Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately 
affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender 
inequality and discrimination, that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as 
boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is 
estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition;

 5. Encourages all States to take action to address gender inequality and 
discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition 
of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of 
the right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including 
income, land and water, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 

 6. Encourages the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the 
right to food to continue mainstreaming a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his 
mandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
Nations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms addressing the right to 
food and food insecurity to integrate a gender perspective into their relevant 
policies, programmes and activities; 

 7. Reaffirms the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and 
nutritious food are inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities;  

 8. Encourages all States to take steps with a view to achieving 
progressively the full realization of the right to food, including steps to promote the 
conditions for everyone to be free from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy 
fully the right to food, and to create and adopt national plans to combat hunger, and 
recognizes in this regard the great efforts and positive developments with respect to 
the right to food in some developing countries and regions including those 
highlighted in the interim report of the Special Rapporteur;11 

 9. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and public 
investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in 
particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investments 
in appropriate, small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to 
reduce vulnerability to droughts; 

 10. Recognizes that 80 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas, and 
50 per cent are small-scale farm-holders, and that these people are especially 
vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of inputs, and the fall in farm 
incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an 
increasing challenge for poor producers; and that support by States for small 
farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises is an element key to food 
security and provision of the right to food;  

 11. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including 
through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop 
desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies 
that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, and, in this regard, calls for 
the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification 
in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, 
Particularly in Africa;12 

 12. Stresses its commitments to promoting and protecting, without 
discrimination, the economic, social and cultural rights of indigenous peoples in 
accordance with international human rights obligations and, as appropriate, in 
accordance with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous

Peoples,13 and acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and 
representatives of indigenous communities have expressed in different forums their 
deep concerns over the obstacles and challenges they face with respect to the full 
enjoyment of the right to food, and calls upon States to take special actions to 
combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and 
malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against 
them; 

 13. Requests all States and private actors, as well as international 
organizations within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to 
promote the effective realization of the right to food for all, including in the ongoing 
negotiations in different fields; 

 14. Recognizes the need to strengthen national commitment as well as 
international assistance, upon request and in cooperation with affected countries, 
towards a better realization and protection of the right to food, and in particular to 
develop national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and 
land because of hunger or natural or man-made disasters affecting the enjoyment of 
the right to food;  

 15. Stresses the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation 
and utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including 
external debt relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to 
implement sustainable food security policies; 

 16. Recognizes the need for a successful conclusion of the Doha 
Development Round negotiations of the World Trade Organization as a contribution 
to creating international conditions that permit the realization of the right to food; 

 17. Stresses that all States should make all efforts to ensure that their 
international policies of a political and economic nature, including international 
trade agreements, do not have a negative impact on the right to food in other 
countries; 

 18. Recalls the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against 
Hunger and Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at 
identifying additional sources of financing for the fight against hunger and poverty; 

 19. Recognizes that the promises made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to 
halve the number of persons who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, and 
invites once again all international financial and development institutions, as well as 
the relevant United Nations agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the 
necessary funding to realize the aim of halving by 2015 the proportion of people 
who suffer from hunger, as well as the right to food as set out in the Rome 
Declaration on World Food Security6 and the United Nations Millennium 
Declaration;4 

 20. Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that 
all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet 
their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a 
comprehensive response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other 
communicable diseases;

 21. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and 
expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 

 22. Stresses the importance of international development cooperation and 
assistance, in particular in activities related to disaster risk reduction and in 
emergency situations such as natural and man-made disasters, diseases and pests, for 
the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, 
while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the 
implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 

 23. Calls upon Member States, the United Nations system and other relevant 
stakeholders to support national efforts aimed at responding rapidly to the food 
crises currently occurring across Africa and expresses its deep concern that funding 
shortfalls are forcing the World Food Programme to cut operations across different 
regions, including Southern Africa;  

 24. Invites all relevant international organizations, including the World Bank 
and the International Monetary Fund, to promote policies and projects that have a 
positive impact on the right to food, to ensure that partners respect the right to food 
in the implementation of common projects, to support strategies of Member States 
aimed at the fulfilment of the right to food and to avoid any actions that could have 
a negative impact on the realization of the right to food; 

 25. Takes note of the interim report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
food, and welcomes the valuable work and commitment of the first mandate-holder 
towards achieving the realization of the right to food;  

 26. Supports the realization of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur as 
extended for a period of three years by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 
6/2 of 27 September 2007;1 

 27. Requests the Secretary-General and the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to provide all the necessary human and financial 
resources for the effective fulfilment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur; 

 28. Welcomes the work already done by the Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights in promoting the right to adequate food, in particular its General 
Comment No. 12 (1999) on the right to adequate food (article 11 of the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights),14 in which the Committee 
affirmed, inter alia, that the right to adequate food is indivisibly linked to the 
inherent dignity of the human person and is indispensable for the fulfilment of other 
human rights enshrined in the International Bill of Human Rights, and is also 
inseparable from social justice, requiring the adoption of appropriate economic, 
environmental and social policies, at both the national and the international levels, 
oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human rights for all; 

 29. Recalls General Comment No. 15 (2002) of the Committee on the right 
to water (articles 11 and 12 of the Covenant),15 in which the Committee noted, inter 
alia, the importance of ensuring sustainable water resources for human consumption 
and agriculture in realization of the right to adequate food;

 30. Reaffirms that the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive 
Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, 
adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
Nations in November 2004,8 represent a practical tool to promote the realization of

Committee and the Special Rapporteur, and encourages them to continue their 
cooperation in this regard;

Rapporteur to visit their countries to enable him to fulfil his mandate more 
effectively; 

 33. Requests the Special Rapporteur to submit an interim report to the
