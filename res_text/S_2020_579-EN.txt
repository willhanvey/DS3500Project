  Viet Nam: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming its determination to combat impunity for all those responsible for 

serious international crimes and the necessity of all persons indicted by the 

International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), and the International Tribunal 

for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) being brought to justice and, in this regard, 

recalling the mandate of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals 

(Mechanism) established by resolution 1966 (2010) of 22 December 2010,  

 Recalling Article 25 and Article 26 of the Statute of the Mechanism, set out in 

Annex 1 to resolution 1966 (2010), concerning the supervision of the enforcement of 

sentences and pardon or commutation of sentences, respectively,  

 Having regard to Article 14, paragraph 4 of the Statute of the Mechanism,  

 Recalling its decision in resolution 2422 (2018) adopted on 27 June 2018 

appointing the Prosecutor of the Mechanism for a period from 1 July 2018 until 30 

June 2020, and that the Prosecutor of the Mechanism may be appointed or reappointed 

for a two-year term, notwithstanding Article 14, paragraph 4 of the Statute of the 

Mechanism,  

 Having considered the nomination by the Secretary-General of Mr. Serge 

Brammertz as Prosecutor of the Mechanism (S/2020/580), 

 Recalling the strong need for States to cooperate with the Mechanism to achieve 

the arrest and surrender of those remaining fugitives indicted by the ICTR, and, in 

this regard, recalling also General Assembly resolution 74/273 of 21 April 2020 

adopted during the review period,  

 Recalling its decision in resolution 1966 (2010) that the Mechanism shall 

operate for an initial period of four years from the first commencement date referred 

to in paragraph 1 of the resolution, to review the progress of the work of the 

Mechanism, including in completing its functions, before the end of this initial period 

and every two years thereafter, and that the Mechanism shall continue to operate for 

subsequent periods of two years following each such review, unless the Security 

Council decides otherwise,  

 Noting that the current period of operation of the Mechanism ends on 30 June 

2020,  

 Having conducted its review of the progress of the work of the Mechanism, 

including in completing its functions, since the last review of the Mechanism in June 

2018, pursuant to paragraph 17 of resolution 1966 (2010) and in accordance with the

procedure set out in the statement of its President of 28 February 2020 

(S/PRST/2020/4),  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 1. Decides to appoint Mr. Serge Brammertz as Prosecutor of the International 

Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals with effect from 1 July 2020 until 

30 June 2022;  

 2. Urges States to cooperate fully with the Mechanism;  

 3. Continues to urge all States, especially States where fugitives are 

suspected of being at large, to intensify their cooperation with and render all 

necessary assistance to the Mechanism, in particular to achieve the arrest and 

surrender of all remaining fugitives indicted by the ICTR as soon as possibl e; 

 4. Notes with concern that the Mechanism faces problems in the relocation 

of acquitted persons and convicted persons who have completed serving their 

sentence, emphasises the importance of finding expeditious and durable solutions to 

these problems, including as part of a reconciliation process, encourages all efforts 

to that end, and, in this regard, reiterates its call upon all States to cooperate with and 

render all necessary assistance to the Mechanism;  

 5. Welcomes the arrest in France on 16 May 2020 of Félicien Kabuga, 

indicted for genocide and crimes against humanity allegedly committed in Rwanda in 

1994, commends the cooperation between the Mechanism, in particular the Office of 

the Prosecutor, and law enforcement and judicial authorities in France, as well as 

Rwanda, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, 

Luxembourg, the United States, Switzerland and others, together with EUROPOL and 

INTERPOL, which contributed to locating and to the arrest of the fugitive, and 

recognises this is an important step of cooperation with the Mechanism, in accordance 

with paragraph 4 of resolution 2422 (2018), to bring to justice persons indicted by the 

ICTR; 

 6. Emphasises that, in view of the substantially reduced nature of the residual 

functions, the Mechanism was established to be a small, temporary and efficient 

structure, whose functions and size will diminish over time, with a small number of 

staff commensurate with its reduced functions, and, recognising in this regard the full 

commitment to these elements expressed by the Mechanism, requests the Mechanism 

to continue to be guided in its activities by these elements;  

 7. Welcomes the report (S/2020/309) submitted by the Mechanism to the 

Council pursuant to its Presidential Statement (S/PRST/2020/4) for the purposes of 

the review of the progress of the work of the Mechanism, including in completing its 

functions, as required by paragraph 17 of resolution 1966 (2010), and the report of 

the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) on the evaluation of the methods 

and work of the Mechanism (S/2020/236), taking note of the OIOS’s conclusions on 

the Mechanism’s implementation of the OIOS recommendations and paragraph 8 of 

resolution 2422 (2018); 

 8. Takes note of the work of the Mechanism to date, in particular 

development of a legal and regulatory framework, procedures, and working practices 

consistent with the Statute of the Mechanism and drawing on lessons learned from 

and best practices of the ICTY and ICTR and of other tribunals, including use of 

rosters to ensure judges and staff are utilized only when required, enabling judges and 

staff to work remotely to the maximum extent possible, and minimizing the need for 

full bench participation in pre-trial and pre-appeal hearing work, in order to produce 

substantial reductions in the costs of judicial activities compared to those of the ICTY 

and ICTR, and commends the Mechanism for its efforts to produce such reductions;

 9. Notes further the views and recommendations made with regard to the 

Mechanism’s work by the Council’s Informal Working Group on International 

Tribunals, as reflected in this resolution, and requests the Mechanism to take into 

account those views and implement the recommendations, and to continue to take 

steps to further enhance efficiency and effective and transparent management, in 

particular: (i) full implementation of the outstanding recommendations of the OIOS; 

(ii) production of clear and focused projections of completion timelines at the earliest 

stage possible and disciplined adherence thereto; (iii) continued ensuring of 

geographic diversity and gender balance of staff, while ensuring continued 

professional expertise; (iv) continued implementation of a human resources policy 

consistent with its temporary mandate; (v) further reduction of costs, including 

through, but not limited to, flexible staff engagement; and (vi) coordination and 

information sharing across the three organs of the Mechanism on matters that affected 

them equally in order to ensure systematic thinking and planning about the future;  

 10. Reiterates its request to the Mechanism to include in its six-monthly 

reports to the Council information on progress achieved in implementing this 

resolution, as well as detailed information on the staffing of the Mechanism, 

respective workload and related costs with breakdown by division and detailed 

projections of the duration of residual functions based on available data;  

 11. Recalls the importance of ensuring the rights of persons detained on the 

authority of the Mechanism in accordance with applicable international standards, 

including those related to health care;  

 12. Recalls its encouragement to the Mechanism in resolution 2422 (2018) to 

consider an appropriate solution to the approach to early release of persons convicted 

by the ICTR, and notes that during the review period, conditions on early release in 

appropriate cases were put in place and the Mechanism refined procedures in this 

regard;  

 13. Notes the conclusion of the Council’s review of the progress of the work 

of the Mechanism, including in completing its functions, since the last review of the 

Mechanism in June 2018, pursuant to resolution 1966 (2010);  

 14. Recalls, with a view to strengthening independent oversight of the 

Mechanism, that, as set out in its Presidential Statement (S/PRST/2020/4), future 

reviews carried out pursuant to paragraph 17 of resolution 1966 (2010) shall include 

evaluation reports sought from the OIOS with respect to the methods and work of the 

Mechanism;  

 15. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
