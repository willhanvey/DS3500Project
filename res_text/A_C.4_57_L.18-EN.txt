A/C.4/57/L.18

Bearing in mind the detrimental impact of Israeli settlement policies, decisions
and activities on efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East,

Expressing grave concern about the continuation by Israel of settlement
activities in violation of international humanitarian law, relevant United Nations
resolutions and the agreements reached between the parties, including the ongoing
construction of the settlements in Jabal Abu-Ghneim and in Ras Al-Amud in and
around Occupied East Jerusalem,

Gravely concerned about the dangerous situation resulting from actions taken
by the illegal armed Israeli settlers in the occupied territory, as illustrated in the
recent period and earlier by the massacre of Palestinian worshippers by an illegal
Israeli settler in Al-Khalil on 25 February 1994, and during the past year,

Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General,3

1. Reaffirms that Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territory, including
East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan are illegal and an obstacle to
peace and economic and social development;

2. Calls upon Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the Geneva
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12
August 1949,1 to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and
to the occupied Syrian Golan and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the
Convention, in particular article 49;

3. Reiterates its demand for the complete cessation of all Israeli settlement
activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the
occupied Syrian Golan, including the construction of the settlement in Jabal Abu
Ghneim;

4. Stresses the need for full implementation of Security Council resolution
904 (1994) of 18 March 1994, in which, among other things, the Council called
upon Israel, the occupying Power, to continue to take and implement measures,
including confiscation of arms, with the aim of preventing illegal acts of violence by
Israeli settlers, and called for measures to be taken to guarantee the safety and
protection of the Palestinian civilians in the occupied territory;

5. Reiterates its calls for the prevention of all acts of violence by Israeli
settlers, particularly in the light of recent developments;

6. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its
fifty-eighth session on the implementation of the present resolution.
