and to understand others,

Stressing the need for strict observance of the resolutions and rules
establishing language arrangements for the different bodies and organs of the
United Nations,

Recalling that Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish are
both official and working languages of the General Assembly and its committees
and subcommittees 1/ and of the Security Council 2/ and that English and French
are the working languages of the Secretariat, 3/

Regretting that unequal use is made of the different official languages and
of the working languages of the Secretariat in the United Nations, and desiring
that persons recruited by the Organization should have a command of and use at
least one of the six official languages in addition to one working language of
the Secretariat,

Considering that the translation and interpretation budgets of United
Nations bodies should be commensurate with the needs and should not be subject
to budgetary constraints, as noted in resolution 42/207 C of 11 December 1987,

Noting that the principle of equality of the official languages is being
called into question with increasing frequency by the holding of so-called
"low-cost" informal meetings,

Emphasizing the need for the Organization to continue to promote the
learning of all the official languages and the working languages of the
Secretariat by members of missions accredited to the Organization and by
Secretariat staff,

Emphasizing also the importance of providing access for all Governments and
all sectors of civil society to the Organization's documentation, archives and
data banks in all the official languages,

1. Requests the Secretary-General to ensure the strict implementation of
the resolutions establishing language arrangements for both the official
languages and the working languages of the Secretariat, and invites Member
States to do likewise;

2. Recalls that the Secretariat is required, in its relations with Member
States, to use the official or working language requested by those States;

3. Requests the Secretary-General to ensure that, upon recruitment,
personnel recruited by the different bodies of the Organization have a command
of and use at least one of the working languages of the Secretariat or one of
the working languages of another body of the Organization, in the case of staff
members who are to work for that body and whose tenure of appointment does not

                        

     1/ Rule 51 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly.

     2/ Rule 41 of the provisional rules of procedure of the Security Council.

exceed two years; also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the use of
another of the six official languages is duly encouraged and taken into account,
particularly when promotions and incremental steps are under consideration, in
order to ensure linguistic balance within the Organization;

4. Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure, in particular in the
recruitment and promotion of Secretariat staff, equality of the working
languages of the Secretariat and of their use within the Organization;

5. Stresses the need to ensure, in particular through the training and
recruitment of specialists, that the necessary resources are available to
guarantee the proper and timely translation of documents into the different
official and working languages of the United Nations;

6. Recalls the need to ensure the simultaneous distribution of such
documents in the official languages of the Organization;

7. Stresses the need to ensure adequate human and financial resources for
maintaining the teaching, at all levels, of the official languages and the
working languages of the Secretariat;

8. Stresses also the importance of ensuring the availability of adequate
data banks and publications in the different official languages in the libraries
and documentation centres of the various bodies;

9. Urges the delegations of Member States and the Secretariat to
endeavour to avoid holding informal meetings without interpretation;

10. Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report at its fifty-second
session on the implementation of this resolution and on the use of the official
languages of the United Nations and the working languages of the Secretariat.
