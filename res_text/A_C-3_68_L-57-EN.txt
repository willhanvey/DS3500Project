conscience and political prisoners, and continues to call upon the Government of the

representation of their choice, the refusal to consider granting bail to detainees, the 
poor conditions of prisons and the denial of access to adequate medical treatment, as 
well as reports of detainees dying in custody, being subjected to torture, rape and 
other forms of sexual violence, harsh interrogation techniques and the use of
