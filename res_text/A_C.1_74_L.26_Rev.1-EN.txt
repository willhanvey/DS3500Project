  Nuclear disarmament verification 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling the fundamental principles for disarmament negotiations set forth in 

the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly, the first 

special session devoted to disarmament,1 and the general principles of verification set 

forth in the United Nations Disarmament Commission principles of verification of 

1988,2 without prejudice to the mandate of the Conference on Disarmament,  

 Recalling also its resolution 71/67 of 5 December 2016, in which it, inter alia, 

requested the Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States and to establish 

a group of governmental experts to consider the role of verification in advancing 

nuclear disarmament, 

 Reaffirming the shared commitment to further progress in nuclear disarmament 

and non-proliferation, 

 Convinced that, while verification is not an aim in itself, further development 

of the multilateral disarmament verification capabilities will be required to provide 

assurance of compliance with multilateral nuclear disarmament agreements for the 

achievement and maintenance of a world without nuclear weapons,

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General,3 

 Recognizing the pioneering nature of the work of the Group of Governmental 

Experts on Nuclear Disarmament Verification, as this represents the first time that the 

General Assembly established a body specifically to discuss nuclear disarmament 

verification, and recognizing also the need for further work related to the role of 

verification in advancing nuclear disarmament, taking into account the report of the 

Group,4 

 Noting that a credible multilateral verification regime in which all States have 

confidence will also be essential for achieving and maintaining a world without 

nuclear weapons, 

 Noting also that capacity-building on nuclear disarmament verification is a 

valuable component in the nuclear disarmament process and also one of the 

fundamental factors determining whether the goal of verification could be effectively 

upheld, and noting further that building capacity on nuclear disarmament verification 

in a sustainable manner is not only of great significance, but also faced with practical 

challenges, 

 Recognizing that nuclear disarmament verification must be balanced against 

legitimate sovereignty-, security-, safety- and proliferation-related concerns of the 

parties to or participants in an agreement or arrangement in this area,  

 Noting the contribution of representatives of civil society from the 

non-governmental, academic and research communities,  

 1. Welcomes the adoption by consensus of the report of the Group of 

Governmental Experts on Nuclear Disarmament Verification, mandated in resolution 

71/67;4

Commission to address nuclear disarmament verification, including through

 4. Welcomes efforts for capacity-building on nuclear disarmament 

verification; 

 5. Encourages further work on nuclear disarmament verification, taking into 

account the report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Nuclear Disarmament 

Verification; 

 6. Requests the Secretary-General to establish a group of governmental 

experts of up to 25 participants, chosen on the basis of equitable geographical 

representation and equitable representation of women and men, which will meet in 

Geneva for four sessions of one week each in 2021 and 2022, to further consider 

nuclear disarmament verification issues, including, inter alia, the concept of a Group 

of Scientific and Technical Experts, building on the report of the Group of 

Governmental Experts on Nuclear Disarmament Verification4 and the views of 

Member States referred to in paragraph 2 above;  

 7. Requests the Chair of the group of governmental experts to organize, in 

New York, two informal intersessional consultative meetings, open-ended so that all
