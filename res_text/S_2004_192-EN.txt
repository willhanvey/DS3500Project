Draft resolution

The Security Council,

Recalling its previous resolutions and the statements by its President
concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo,

Reiterating its concern regarding the presence of armed groups and militias in
the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly in North and
South Kivu and in Ituri, which perpetuate a climate of insecurity in the whole
region,

Condemning the continuing illicit flow of weapons into the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, and declaring its determination to closely monitor
compliance with the arms embargo imposed by its resolution 1493 of 28 July 2003,

Underscoring the right of the Congolese people to control their own natural
resources, recalling in this regard the statement made by its President on 19
November 2003 (S/PRST/2003/21), which emphasizes the connection, in the context
of the continuing conflict, between the illegal exploitation of natural resources and
trafficking in raw materials and arms, as highlighted in the final report of the Panel
of Experts on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources and Other Forms of
Wealth in the Democratic Republic of Congo (S/2003/1027), and stressing for this
purpose, the need for all Member States to work to achieve an end to the illegal
exploitation of natural resources,

Encouraging all States signatories to the Nairobi Declaration of 15 March
2000 on the Problem of the Proliferation of Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons in
the Great Lakes Region and Horn of Africa to implement quickly the measures
required by the Co-ordinated Agenda for Action as an important means of support of
the measures imposed by paragraph 20 of resolution 1493,

Taking note of the Secretary-General’s fourteenth report on the United Nations
Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), dated 17
November 2003 (S/2003/1098), and of its recommendations,

Noting that the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to
constitute a threat to international peace and security in the region,

Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,

1. Reaffirms the demand, laid down in paragraph 20 of resolution 1493, that
all States take the necessary measures to prevent the supply of arms and any related

materiel or assistance to armed groups operating in North and South Kivu and in

crossings in North and South Kivu and in Ituri;

4. Authorizes MONUC to seize or collect, as appropriate, the arms and any

5. Reiterates its demand that all parties provide immediate, unconditional
and unhindered access to MONUC personnel, in accordance with paragraphs 15 and
19 of resolution 1493, to enable them to carry out the tasks outlined in paragraphs 3
and 4 above;

6. Reiterates its condemnation of the continuing illegal exploitation of
natural resources in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, especially in the eastern
part of the country, which contributes to the perpetuation of the conflict, and
reaffirms the importance of bringing an end to these illegal activities, including by
applying the necessary pressure on the armed groups, traffickers and all other actors
involved;

7. Urges all States, and especially those in the region, to take the
appropriate steps to end these illegal activities, including through judicial means
where possible, and, if necessary, to report to the Council;
