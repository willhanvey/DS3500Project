Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration4 and the outcome
documents of the twenty-third5 and twenty-fourth6 special sessions of the General
Assembly, held in New York from 5 to 10 June 2000 and in Geneva from 26 June to
1 July 2000, respectively,

Recalling also its resolution 59/184 of 8 March 2005,

Recalling further Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/17 of
14 April 2005 on globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of all human
rights,7

Recognizing that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent
and interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights
globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same
emphasis,

Realizing that globalization affects all countries differently and makes them
more exposed to external developments, positive as well as negative, inter alia, in
the field of human rights,

Realizing also that globalization is not merely an economic process, but that it
also has social, political, environmental, cultural and legal dimensions, which have
an impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights,

Welcoming the affirmation of the commitment contained in paragraphs 19 and
47 of the 2005 World Summit Outcome8 to promote fair globalization and the
development of the productive sectors in developing countries to enable them to
participate more effectively in and benefit from the process of globalization,

Realizing further the need to undertake a thorough, independent and
comprehensive assessment of the social, environmental and cultural impact of
globalization on societies,

Recognizing in each culture a dignity and value that deserve recognition,
respect and preservation, convinced that, in their rich variety and diversity and in
the reciprocal influences that they exert on one another, all cultures form part of the
common heritage belonging to all humankind, and aware that the risk of a global
monoculture poses more of a threat if the developing world remains poor and
marginalized,

Recognizing also that multilateral mechanisms have a unique role to play in
meeting the challenges and opportunities presented by globalization,

Underlining the urgency of mainstreaming and addressing migration in the
context of globalization,

Expressing concern at the negative impact of international financial turbulence
on social and economic development and on the full enjoyment of all human rights,

Recognizing that globalization should be guided by the fundamental principles
that underpin the corpus of human rights, such as equity, participation,
accountability, non-discrimination at both the national and international levels,
respect for diversity, tolerance and international cooperation, and solidarity,

Deeply concerned at the inadequacy of measures to narrow the widening gap
between the developed and the developing countries, and within countries, which
has contributed, inter alia, to deepening poverty and has adversely affected the full
enjoyment of all human rights, in particular in developing countries,

Noting that human beings strive for a world that is respectful of human rights
and cultural diversity and that, in this regard, they work to ensure that all activities,
including those affected by globalization, are consistent with those aims,

1. Recognizes that, while globalization, by its impact on, inter alia, the role
of the State, may affect human rights, the promotion and protection of all human
rights is first and foremost the responsibility of the State;

2. Emphasizes that development should be at the centre of the international
economic agenda and that coherence between national development strategies, and
international obligation and commitments are imperative for an enabling
environment for development and an inclusive and equitable globalization;

3. Reaffirms that narrowing the gap between rich and poor, both within and
between countries, is an explicit goal at the national and international levels, as part
of the effort to create an enabling environment for the full enjoyment of all human
rights;

4. Reaffirms also the commitment to create an environment at both the
national and the global levels that is conducive to development and to the
elimination of poverty through, inter alia, good governance within each country and
at the international level, transparency in the financial, monetary and trading
systems and commitment to an open, equitable, rule-based, predictable and non-
discriminatory multilateral trading and financial system;

5. Recognizes that, while globalization offers great opportunities, the fact
that its benefits are very unevenly shared and its costs unevenly distributed
represents an aspect of the process that affects the full enjoyment of all human
rights, in particular in developing countries;

6. Welcomes the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights on globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of human
rights,9 which focuses on the liberalization of agricultural trade and its impact on
the realization of the right to development, including the right to food, and takes
note of the conclusions and recommendations contained therein;

7. Calls upon Member States, relevant agencies of the United Nations
system, intergovernmental organizations and civil society to promote equitable and
environmentally sustainable economic growth for managing globalization so that
poverty is systematically reduced and the international development targets are
achieved;

8. Recognizes that only through broad and sustained efforts, including
policies and measures at the global level to create a shared future based upon our
common humanity in all its diversity, can globalization be made fully inclusive and
equitable and have a human face, thus contributing to the full enjoyment of all
human rights;

9. Underlines the urgent need to establish an equitable, transparent and
democratic international system to strengthen and broaden the participation of
developing countries in international economic decision-making and norm-setting;

10. Affirms that globalization is a complex process of structural
transformation, with numerous interdisciplinary aspects, which has an impact on the
enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right
to development;

11. Affirms also that the international community should strive to respond to
the challenges and opportunities posed by globalization in a manner that ensures
respect for the cultural diversity of all;

12. Underlines, therefore, the need to continue to analyse the consequences
of globalization for the full enjoyment of all human rights;

13. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General,10 and requests the
Secretary-General to seek further the views of Member States and relevant agencies
of the United Nations system and to submit a substantive report on this subject to
the General Assembly at its sixtieth sixty-first session.
