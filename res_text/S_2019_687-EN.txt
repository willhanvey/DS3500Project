  France: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling all its previous resolutions, statements of its President and press 

statements on the situation in Mali,  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, unity and territorial 

integrity of Mali, emphasizing that the Malian authorities have primary responsibility 

for the provision of stability and security throughout the territory of Mali, and 

underscoring the importance of achieving national ownership of peace- and security-

related initiatives,  

 Recalling the provisions of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali 

(“the Agreement”) calling upon the Security Council to give its full support to the 

Agreement, to closely monitor its implementation and, if necessary, to take measures 

against anyone hindering the implementation of the commitments contained therein 

or the realisation of its objectives,  

 Recognizing that more progress was made during the past year than during the 

first years after the signing of the Agreement, which were characterized by a slow 

pace of implementation, noting that a combination of some level of political will and 

international pressure, including through the prospect of sanctions, constituted an 

important factor in securing these positive results, expressing a significant sense of 

impatience with parties over the persistent delays in the full implementation of key 

provisions of the Agreement, further noting that continued delays in implementation 

contribute to a political and security vacuum jeopardizing the stability and 

development of Mali as well as the viability of the Agreement, stressing the need for 

increased ownership and prioritization in the implementation of the Agreement, and 

further stressing the importance of the full, effective and meaningful participation of 

women in the mechanisms established by the Agreement to support and monitor its 

implementation, 

 Recalling the provisions of resolution 2480 (2019) urging Malian parties to take 

immediate and concrete action to fulfil the priority measures listed in paragraph 4 of 

resolution 2480 (2019) before the end of MINUSMA’s current mandate, encouraging 

the Panel of Experts established pursuant to resolution 2374 (2017) (“the Panel of 

Experts”) to identify parties responsible for potential lack of implementation of these 

priority measures through its regular reporting and interim updates, and expressing 

its intent, should these priority measures not be implemented by the end of 

MINUSMA’s current mandate, to respond with measures pursuant to resolution 2374 

(2017) on individuals and entities who are thus obstructing or threatening the 

implementation of the Agreement,

 Stressing that all parties to the Agreement share the primary responsibility to 

make steadfast progress in its implementation,  

 Taking note of the decisions of the Security Council Committee established 

pursuant to resolution 2374 (2017) concerning Mali (“the Committee”) of 

20 December 2018 and 10 July 2019 that several individuals be placed on the list of 

individuals and entities subject to measures pursuant to resolution 2374 (2017) (“the 

2374 Sanctions List”) and further taking note of the intention of the Committee to 

consider the removal of these individuals from the 2374 Sanctions List if the priority 

measures listed in paragraph 4 of resolution 2480 (2019) are fully implemented and 

the individuals designated cease all illicit activities, including those listed in the 

statement of case, while stressing that the Security Council has not yet seen sufficient 

progress to merit such consideration,  

 Reiterating that individuals or entities placed on the 2374 Sanctions List shall 

not benefit from any financial, operational or logistical support from United Nations 

entities deployed in Mali, until their removal from the 2374 Sanctions List and 

without prejudice to the exemptions set by paragraphs 2, 5, 6 and 7 of resolution 2374 

(2017), 

 Taking note of the final report (S/2019/636) of the Panel of Experts, 

 Noting the importance of continued cooperation and information exchange 

between the Panel of Experts and all other United Nations entities operating in Mali, 

within their mandates and capabilities,  

 Determining that the situation in Mali continues to constitute a threat to 

international peace and security in the region,  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 1. Decides to renew until 31 August 2020 the measures as set out in 

paragraphs 1 to 7 of resolution 2374 (2017);  

 2. Reaffirms that these measures shall apply to individuals and entities as 

designated by the Committee, as set forth in paragraphs 8 and 9 of resolution 2374

 3. Decides to extend until 30 September 2020 the mandate of the Panel of 

Experts, as set out in paragraphs 11 to 15 of resolution 2374 (2017), as well as the 

request to MINUSMA, as set out in paragraph 16 of resolution 2374 (2017), expresses 

its intention to review the mandate and take appropriate action regarding its further 

extension no later than 31 August 2020, and requests the Secretary-General to take 

the necessary administrative measures as expeditiously as possible to re -establish the 

Panel of Experts, in consultation with the Committee, drawing, as appropriate, on the 

expertise of the current members of the Panel of Experts;  

 4. Requests the Panel of Experts to provide to the Council, after discussion 

with the Committee, a midterm report no later than 29 February 2020, a final report 

no later than 15 August 2020, and periodic updates in between, as appropriate;  

 5. Reaffirms the reporting and review provisions as set out in resolution 2374 

(2017);  

 6. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
