Occupied Palestinian Territory,2 and recalling also its resolutions ES-10/15 of 
20 July 2004 and ES-10/17 of 15 December 2006, 

 Convinced that achieving a just, lasting and comprehensive settlement of the

attainment of comprehensive and lasting peace and stability in the Middle East, 

 Aware that the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples is 
among the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, 

 Affirming the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by 
war, 

 Recalling its resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970, 

 Reaffirming the illegality of the Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territory 
occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, 

 Reaffirming also the illegality of Israeli actions aimed at changing the status of 
Jerusalem, including measures such as the so-called E-l plan and all other unilateral 
measures aimed at altering the character, status and demographic composition of the 
city and the territory as a whole, 

 Reaffirming further that the construction by Israel, the occupying Power, of a 
wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, 
and its associated regime, are contrary to international law,

severe restrictions on the movement of persons and goods, including medical and

economic situation of the Palestinian people, which remains that of a dire 
humanitarian crisis, 

 Concerned about the continued establishment of Israeli checkpoints in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the transformation of 
several of these checkpoints into structures akin to permanent border crossings 
inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which are severely impairing the 
territorial contiguity of the Territory and severely undermining efforts and aid aimed 
at rehabilitating and developing the Palestinian economy, 

 Recalling the mutual recognition between the Government of the State of 
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, the representative of the 
Palestinian people,3 and the agreements concluded between the two sides and the 
need for full compliance with those agreements,

(2003), of the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State solution to the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict,4 and stressing the urgent need for its implementation and 
compliance with its provisions,
