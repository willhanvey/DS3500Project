 Recalling the commitments of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action

resolution 1325, recognizing with appreciation all the work undertaken for the 

Global Study and encouraging close examination of its recommendations,

relevant thematic areas of work on its agenda, including threats to international 

peace and security caused by terrorist acts, 

 Recognizing the differential impact on the human rights of women and girls of 

terrorism and violent extremism, including in the context of their health, education, 

and participation in public life, and that they are often directly targeted by terrorist 

groups, and expressing deep concern that acts of sexual and gender-based violence 

are known to be part of the strategic objectives and ideology of certain terrorist 

groups, used as a tactic of terrorism, and an instrument to increase their power 

through supporting financing, recruitment, and the destruction of communities, as 

described in the Secretary-General’s Report on Sexual Violence in Conflict of

relatively low number of women in senior positions in political, peace and security-

related national, regional and international institutions, the lack of adequate gender -
