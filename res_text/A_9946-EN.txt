resolution 45 (III) of 18 May 1972, stressed the urgency "to establish generally 
accepted norms to govern international economic relations systematically" and 
recognized that "it is not feasible to establish a just order and a stable world 
as long as the Charter to protect the rights of all countries, and in particular 
the developing States, is not formulated", 

Recalling further that in the same resolution it was decided to establish a 
Working Group of governmental representatives to draw up a draft Charter of 
Economic Rights and Duties of States, which the General Assembly, in its resolution 
3037 (XXVII) of 19 December 1972, decided should be composed of 40 Member States, 

Noting that in its resolution 3082 (XXVIII) of 6 December 1973, it reaffimed 
its conviction of the urgent need to establish or improve norms of universal 
application for the development of international economic relations on a just and 
equitable basis and urged the Working Group on the Charter of Economic Rights and 
Duties of States to complete, as the first step, in the codification and development 
of the matter, the elaboration of a final draft Charter of Economic Rights and 
Duties of States, to be considered and approved by the General Assembly at its 
twenty-ninth session, 

Bearing in mind the spirit and terms of its resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 
3202 (S-VI) of l May 1974, containing the Declaration and the Programme of Action 
on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order, which underlined the 
vital importance of the Charter to be adopted by the General Assembly at its 
twenty-ninth session and stressed the fact that the Charter shall constitute an 
effective instrument towards the establishment of a new system of international 
economic relations based on equity, sovereign equality, and interdependence of the 
interests of developed and developing countries, 

Having examined the report of the 1oorking Group on the Charter of Economic 
Rights and Duties of States on its fourth session, 11/ transmitted to the General 
Assembly by the Trade and Development Board at its fourteenth session, 

Expressing its appreciation to the Working Group on the Charter of Economic
