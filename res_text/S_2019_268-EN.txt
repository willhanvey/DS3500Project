offences in domestic laws and regulations and that the punishment duly reflects the 

seriousness of such terrorist acts, 

 Reaffirming that Member States must ensure that any measures taken to counter 

terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, in particular 

international human rights law, international refugee law, and international 

humanitarian law, underscoring that respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms 

and the rule of law are complementary and mutually reinforcing with effective 

counter-terrorism measures, and are an essential part of a successful counter-terrorism 

effort, noting the importance of respect for the rule of law so as to effectively prevent 

and combat terrorism, and noting that failure to comply with these and other 

international obligations, including under the Charter of the United Nations, is one of 

the factors contributing to increased radicalization to violence and fosters a sense of 

impunity, 

 Noting with grave concern that terrorists and terrorist groups raise funds through 

a variety of means, which include but are not limited to abuse of legitimate 

commercial enterprise, exploitation of natural resources, abuse of non-profit 

organizations, donations, crowdfunding and proceeds of criminal activity, including 

but not limited to : kidnapping for ransom, extortion, the illicit trade and trafficking 

in cultural property, trafficking in persons, including for the purpose of sexual 

exploitation, drug trafficking and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons,  

 Further noting with grave concern that terrorists, including foreign terrorist 

fighters, and terrorist groups may move and transfer funds, including through 

financial institutions, abuse of legitimate businesses and non-profit organizations, 

including as front businesses and organizations and cash-couriers, as well as through 

the use of emerging payment methods, such as prepaid cards and mobile-payments or 

virtual-assets, 

 Expressing concern that terrorists can benefit from transnational organized 

crime as a source of financing or logistical support, recognizing that the nature and 

scope of the linkages between terrorism and transnational organized crime vary by 

context, and emphasizing the need to coordinate efforts at the local, national, regional, 

sub regional and international levels to respond to this challenge, in accordance with 

international law, 

 Reiterating its concern at the continuing use by terrorists and their supporters 

of information and communications technologies, in particular the Internet, to 

facilitate terrorist acts, as well as their use to incite, recruit, fund, or plan terrorist 

acts, 

 Recognizing that innovations in financial technologies, products and services 

may offer significant economic opportunities but also present a risk of being misused, 

including for terrorist financing,  

 Underscoring the central role of the United Nations, in particular its Secur ity 

Council, in the fight against terrorism and stressing the essential role of the Financial 

Action Task Force (FATF) in setting global standards for preventing and combatting 

money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing and its Globa l 

Network of FATF-style regional bodies (FSRBs) and taking note with appreciation of 

the “FATF Consolidated Strategy on Combating Terrorist Financing” and its 

operational plan, 

 Encouraging Member States to actively cooperate with FATF, including by 

contributing to its monitoring of terrorist financing risks,  

 Expressing its commitment to continue supporting efforts to deny terrorist 

groups’ access to funding and financial services through the ongoing work of the 



 
S/2019/268 

 

3/8 19-05231 

 

United Nations counter-terrorism bodies and the FATF and its FSRBs to improve 

anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing frameworks worldwide, 

particularly their implementation,  

 Welcoming the adoption by its Counter-Terrorism Committee of the Addendum 

to the Madrid Guiding Principles on Foreign Terrorist Fighters (S/2018/1177), which 

contains, inter alia, specific recommendations on countering the financing of 

terrorism and stressing the importance of full and effective implementation of such 

principles, 

 Commending efforts undertaken at the national, regional and multilateral levels 

to foster international cooperation to prevent and suppress the financing of terrorism,  

 Noting with appreciation the holding of the conference entitled “No Money for 

Terror” in Paris on 25–26 April 2018 as well as its final declaration and looking 

forward to the upcoming conference to be held in Australia in 2019,  

 Reaffirming that sanctions are an important tool under the Charter of the United 

Nations in the maintenance and restoration of international peace and security, 

including in countering terrorism and terrorism financing,  

 Noting with concern that many Member States have not effectively enacted and 

enforced the prohibition described in paragraph 1 (d) of resolution 1373, and that the 

provision of financial or other related services to terrorist organizations and 

individual terrorists, even in the absence of a link to a specific terrorist act , furthers 

their ability to engage in terrorist acts,  

 Recognizing the significant need to build and strengthen capacities of Member 

States, upon their request and with a view to supporting national ownership to more 

effectively counter terrorism and terrorist financing and to make better use of existing 

international instruments and mechanisms,  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,

States shall prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts and refrain from 

providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities or persons involved in 

terrorist acts, including by suppressing recruitment of members of terrorist groups 

and eliminating the supply of weapons to terrorists;  

 2. Emphasizes its decision in resolution 1373 that all Member States shall 

criminalize the wilful provision or collection, by any means, directly or indirectly, of 

funds by their nationals or in their territories with the intention that the funds should 

be used, or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in order to carry out terrorist 

acts; and its decision in resolution 2178 that all Member States shall establish  serious 

criminal offenses regarding the travel, recruitment, and financing of foreign terrorist 

fighters;  

 3. Highlights that the obligation regarding the prohibition in paragraph 1 (d) 

of resolution 1373 applies to making funds, financial assets or economic resources or 

financial or other related services available, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of 

terrorist organizations or individual terrorists for any purpose, including but not 

limited to recruitment, training, or travel, even in the absence of a link to a specific 

terrorist act;  

 4. Strongly urges all States to implement the comprehensive international 

standards embodied in the revised Forty FATF Recommendations on Combating 

Money Laundering, and the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation and its

prosecute and to penalize in a manner duly reflecting the seriousness of the offense 

the wilful provision or collection of funds, financial assets or economic resources or 

financial or other related services, directly or indirectly, with the intention that the 

funds should be used, or in the knowledge that they are to be used for the benefit of 

terrorist organizations or individual terrorists for any purpose, including but not 

limited to recruitment, training, or travel, even in the absence of a link to a specific 

terrorist act;  

 6. Demands that Member States ensure that all measures taken to counter 

terrorism, including measures taken to counter the financing of terrorism as provided 

for in this resolution, comply with their obligations under international law, including 

international humanitarian law, international human rights law and international 

refugee law;  

 7. Calls upon Member States to conduct financial investigations in terrorism 

related cases and to seek ways to address the challenges in obtaining evidence to 

secure terrorist financing convictions;

prosecute cases of terrorist financing and to apply, as appropriate, effective, 

proportionate, and dissuasive criminal sanctions to individuals and entities convicted 

of terrorist financing activity;

with the measures imposed by the Security Council in resolution 2368 (2017) and 

recalls that the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team mandate includes 

gathering information on instances of reported non-compliance with the sanctions 

measures imposed in resolution 2368 (2017), including by collating information from 

all relevant sources and that such reporting should be discussed in the  Committee;

 12. Stresses the need for robust implementation of the measures outlined in 

paragraph 1 of resolution 2368 (2017) and urges all States to participate actively in

consider including, when submitting new listing requests, individuals and entities 

involved in the financing of terrorism;  

 13. Calls on States to invest resources in the implementation of sanctions 

regimes pursuant to resolutions 1373 (2001), 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011) and 2253
