 Expressing grave concern about the continuing systematic violation of the 
human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel, the occupying Power, including 
that arising from the excessive use of force, the use of collective punishment, the 
closure of areas, the confiscation of land, the establishment and expansion of 
settlements, the construction of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory in 
departure from the Armistice Line of 1949, the destruction of property and 
infrastructure, and all other actions by it designed to change the legal status, 
geographical nature and demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem,  

 Gravely concerned about the military actions that have been carried out since 
28 September 2000 and that have led to thousands of deaths among Palestinian 
civilians, including hundreds of children, and tens of thousands of injuries,  

 Gravely concerned in particular about the continuing deterioration in the 
humanitarian and security situation in the Gaza Strip, including that resulting from 
the prolonged closures and severe economic and movement restrictions that in effect 
amount to a blockade and the military operations between December 2008 and 
January 2009, which caused extensive loss of life and injury, particularly among 
Palestinian civilians, including children and women; widespread destruction and 
damage to Palestinian homes, properties, vital infrastructure and public institutions, 
including hospitals, schools and United Nations facilities; and the internal 
displacement of civilians, as well as from the firing of rockets into Israel,  

 Stressing the need for the full implementation by all parties of Security 
Council resolution 1860 (2009) and resolution ES-10/18 of 16 January 2009, 

 Gravely concerned by reports regarding serious human rights violations and 
grave breaches of international humanitarian law committed during the military 
operations in the Gaza Strip between December 2008 and January 2009, including 
the findings in the summary by the Secretary-General of the report of the Board of 
Inquiry10 and in the report of the United Nations Fact-finding Mission on the Gaza 
Conflict,11 and stressing the necessity for serious follow-up by all parties of the 
recommendations addressed to them towards ensuring accountability and justice, 

 Expressing deep concern about the short- and long-term detrimental impact of 
such widespread destruction and the impeding of the reconstruction process by 
Israel, the occupying Power, on the human rights situation and on the  
socio-economic and humanitarian conditions of the Palestinian civilian population,  

 Expressing deep concern also about the Israeli policy of closures, severe 
restrictions, and a permit regime that obstruct the freedom of movement of persons 
and goods, including medical and humanitarian personnel and goods, throughout the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and about the consequent 
violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people and the negative impact on 
their socio-economic situation, which remains that of a dire humanitarian crisis, 
particularly in the Gaza Strip, 

 Concerned in particular about the continued establishment of Israeli 
checkpoints in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the 
transformation of several of these checkpoints into structures akin to permanent

children and women, continue to be held in Israeli prisons or detention centres under 
harsh conditions that impair their well-being, and expressing concern about the ill-
treatment and harassment of any Palestinian prisoners and all reports of torture,

 4. Condemns all acts of violence, including all acts of terror, provocation,

and to and from the outside world;  

 10. Calls upon Israel, the occupying Power, to cease its imposition of

Crossing, both of 15 November 2005;
