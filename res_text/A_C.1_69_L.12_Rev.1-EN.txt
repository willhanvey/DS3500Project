announcement by Austria to convene a third meeting on the humanitarian impact of 

nuclear weapons on 8 and 9 December 2014, 

 Emphasizing the evidence presented at the Conferences on the Humanitarian 

Impact of Nuclear Weapons, which detailed the catastrophic consequences that 

would result from a nuclear weapon detonation, reaching well beyond national 

borders, the lack of capacity of States and international organizations to deal with 

the aftermath, and the risk of an occurrence due to an accident, systems failure or 

human error,  

 Recalling the convening, on 26 September 2013, of the high-level meeting of 

the General Assembly on nuclear disarmament and resolution 68/32 of 5 December 

2013 on the follow-up to the 2013 high-level meeting of the Assembly on nuclear 

disarmament and the decisions contained therein,  

 Recalling also that the 2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on 

the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will take place 20 years after the 

indefinite extension of the Treaty and 70 years after the use of nuclear weapons on 

Hiroshima and Nagasaki, representing a historic opportunity to advance nuclear 

disarmament,  

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General2 on taking forward multilateral 

nuclear disarmament negotiations, which includes the steps already taken by 

Member States to promote multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations pursuant 

to resolution 68/46 of 5 December 2013,  

 Underlining the importance of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation 

education,  

 Reaffirming that transparency, verifiability and irreversibility are cardinal 

principles applying to nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, which are 

mutually reinforcing processes,  

 Recalling the decisions and the resolution adopted at the 1995 Review and 

Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 

Nuclear Weapons,3 the basis upon which the Treaty was indefinitely extended, and 

the Final Documents of the 20004 and the 20105 Review Conferences of the Parties 

to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and in particular the 

unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon States to accomplish the total 

elimination of their nuclear arsenals, leading to nuclear disarmament, in accordance 

with commitments made under article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 

Nuclear Weapons,6 

 Reaffirming the commitment of all States parties to the Treaty on the

verifiability and transparency in relation to the implementation of their treaty 

obligations,  

 Recalling that the 2010 Review Conference reaffirmed and recognized that the 

total elimination of nuclear weapons is the only absolute guarantee against the use 

or threat of use of nuclear weapons and the legitimate interest of non-nuclear-

weapon States in receiving unequivocal and legally binding negative security 

assurances from nuclear-weapon States pending the total elimination of nuclear 

weapons,  

 Recognizing the continued vital importance of the entry into force of the 

Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty7 to the advancement of nuclear 

disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation objectives, and welcoming the recent 

ratification of the Treaty by the Congo and Niue, 

 Reaffirming the conviction that, pending the total elimination of nuclear 

weapons, the establishment and maintenance of nuclear-weapon-free zones 

enhances global and regional peace and security, strengthens the nuclea r 

non-proliferation regime and contributes towards realizing the objectives of nuclear 

disarmament, welcoming the third preparatory meeting for the third Conference of 

States Parties and Signatories to Treaties that Establish Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones 

and Mongolia, held in New York on 7 May 2014, and welcoming also the 

coordination by Indonesia of the third Conference, in 2015,  

 Welcoming the signing by the nuclear-weapon States of the Protocol to the 

Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia on 6 May 2014, and urging 

those States to continue making real progress towards strengthening all existing 

nuclear-weapon-free zones through, inter alia, the withdrawal or revision of any 

reservations or interpretative declarations contrary to the object and purpose of the 

treaties establishing such zones,  

 Recalling the encouragement expressed at the 2010 Review Conference for the 

establishment of further nuclear-weapon-free zones, on the basis of arrangements 

freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned, reaffirming the 

expectation that this will be followed by concerted international efforts to create 

such zones in areas where they do not currently exist, especially in the Middle East, 

and in that context recognizing the agreement at the 2010 Review Conference on 

practical steps to fully implement the 1995 resolution on the Middle East,  

 Acknowledging the ongoing efforts towards the full implementation of the 

Treaty between the Russian Federation and the United States of America on 

Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, 

while re-emphasizing the encouragement of the 2010 Review Conference to both 

States to continue discussions on follow-on measures in order to achieve deeper 

reductions in their nuclear arsenals,  

 Deeply disappointed at the continued absence of progress towards multilateral 

negotiations on nuclear disarmament, in particular in the Conference on 

Disarmament, despite intensive efforts during its 2014 session,

 Underlining the importance of multilateralism in relation to nuclear 

disarmament, while recognizing also the value of unilateral, bilateral and regional 

initiatives, and the importance of compliance with the terms of such initiatives,  

 Recalling the third session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2015 Review 

Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 

Weapons, held in New York from 28 April to 9 May 2014,  

 Taking note of the reports presented by the nuclear-weapon States to the 

Preparatory Committee for the 2015 Review Conference at its third session,8 

pursuant to actions 5, 20 and 21 of the action plan on nuclear disarmament 

contained in the Final Document of the 2010 Review Conference,
1
  

 Emphasizing the importance of a successful 2015 Review Conference, which 

should contribute to strengthening the Treaty and making progress towards 

achieving its full implementation and universality, and monitor the implementation 

of commitments made and actions agreed at the 1995, 2000 and 2010 Review 

Conferences,  

 1. Reiterates that each article of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 

Nuclear Weapons is binding on the States parties at all times and in all 

circumstances and that all States parties should be held fully accountable with 

respect to strict compliance with their obligations under the Treaty, and calls upon 

all States parties to comply fully with all decisions, resolutions and commitments 

made at the 1995, 2000 and 2010 Review Conferences;  

 2. Also reiterates the deep concern expressed by the 2010 Review 

Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 

at the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons, and 

the need for all States at all times to comply with applicable international law, 

including international humanitarian law;  

 3. Calls upon the 2015 Review Conference, in its decisions and follow-on 

actions, to give due prominence to the humanitarian imperatives which further 

underpin the need for nuclear disarmament and to the urgency, in the l ight of those 

imperatives, of achieving and maintaining a world free of nuclear weapons;  

 4. Recalls the reaffirmation of the continued validity of the practical steps 

agreed to in the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the 

Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,9 including the specific 

reaffirmation of the unequivocal undertaking of the nuclear-weapon States to 

accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear
