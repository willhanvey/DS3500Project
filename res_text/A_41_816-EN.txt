I I I . RECOMMENDATION OF THE FIRST COMMITTEE

6. The First Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the
following draft resolution:

Implementation of General Assembly Resolution 40/79 concerninq
the Signature and Ratification of Additional Protocol I of the
Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America

(Treaty of Tlatelolco)

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolutions 2286 (XXII) of 5 December 1967, 3262 (XXIX) of
9 December 1974, 3473 (XXX) of 11 December 1975, 32/76 of 12 December 1977,
S-10/2 of 30 June 1978, 33/58 of 14 December 1978, 34/71 of 11 December 1979,
35/143 of 12 December 1980, 36/83 of 9 December 1981, 37/71 Of
9 December 1982, 38/61 of 15 December 1983, 39/51 of 12 December 1984 and
40/79 of 12 December 1985 concerning the signature and ratification Of
Additional Protocol I of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in
Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco),

Taking into account that, within the zone of application of that Treaty,
to which twenty-three sovereign States are already parties, there are Some
Territories which, in spite of not being sovereign political entities, are
nevertheless in a position to receive the benefits deriving from the Treaty
through its Additional Protocol I, to which the four States that de jure or
de facto are internationally responsible for those Territories may become
parties,

Considering that it would not be fair that the peoples of some of those
Territories were deprived of such benefits without being given the opportunity
to express their opinion in this connection,

Recalling that three of the States to which the Additional Protocol I is
opened - the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Kingdom
of the Netherlands and the United States of America - became parties to the
Protocol in 1969, 1971 and 1981, respectively,

1. Deplores that the signature of Additional Protocol I by France?
which took place on 2 March 1979, has not yet been followed by the
corresponding ratification, notwithstanding the time already elapsed and the
pressing invitations which the General Assembly has addressed to it;

2. Once more urges France not to delay any further such ratification,
which has been requested so many times and which appears all the more
advisable, since France is the only one of the four States to which the
PKotocol iS open that is not yet party to it;
