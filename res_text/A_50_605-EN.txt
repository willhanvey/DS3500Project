The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolution 49/35 A of 9 December 1994 and all its previous
resolutions on the question, including resolution 194 (III) of 11 December 1948,

Taking note of the report of the Commissioner-General of the United Nations
Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East covering the
period from 1 July 1994 to 30 June 1995, 4/

Welcoming the signature by the Government of the State of Israel and the

Welcoming also the signature by the Government of the State of Israel and
the Palestine Liberation Organization of the Interim Agreement on the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip at Washington on 28 September 1995,

Commending the work of the Multilateral Working Group on Refugees of the
Middle East peace process,

1. Notes with regret that repatriation or compensation of the refugees,
as provided for in paragraph 11 of its resolution 194 (III), has not yet been
effected and that, therefore, the situation of the refugees continues to be a
matter of concern;

2. Expresses its thanks to the Commissioner-General and to all the staff
of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near
East, recognizing that the Agency is doing all it can within the limits of

3. Notes with regret that the United Nations Conciliation Commission for
Palestine has been unable to find a means of achieving progress in the
implementation of paragraph 11 of resolution 194 (III), 6/ and requests the
Commission to exert continued efforts towards the implementation of that
paragraph and to report to the General Assembly as appropriate, but not later

Refugees in the Near East an updated plan for the transfer;

7. Reiterates its concern about the continuing seriousness of the
financial position of the Agency, as outlined in the report of the Commissioner-
General;

8. Notes with profound concern that the structural deficit problem
confronting the Agency portends an almost certain decline in the living
conditions of Palestine refugees and therefore has possible consequences for the
peace process;

9. Calls upon all Governments, as a matter of urgency, to make the most
generous efforts possible to meet the anticipated needs of the Agency, including
the costs of moving the headquarters to Gaza, and urges non-contributing

resolution 194 (III).
