 Recalling its resolution 63/58 of 2 December 2008, 

 Reiterating its grave concern at the danger to humanity posed by the 
possibility that nuclear weapons could be used,  

 Noting with satisfaction the renewed interest in nuclear disarmament on the 
part of international leaders expressed, inter alia, during the Security Council 
summit on nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament held on 24 September

weapons, 

 Reaffirming that nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are 
mutually reinforcing processes requiring urgent irreversible progress on both fronts, 

 Recognizing the continued vital importance of the early entry into force of the 
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty1 to the advancement of nuclear 
disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation objectives, and welcoming the recent 
ratifications of the Treaty by Lebanon, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique and Saint 
Vincent and the Grenadines, 

 Recalling that the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the

and regional peace and security, strengthens the nuclear non-proliferation regime 
and contributes towards realizing the objectives of nuclear disarmament”,2 

 Welcoming the entry into force, on 21 March 2009, of the Treaty on a Nuclear-
Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia and the entry into force, on 15 July 2009, of the 
Treaty of Pelindaba,3 which establishes a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa, and 
expressing the hope that these important steps will be followed by concerted 
international efforts to create nuclear-weapon-free zones in other areas in the world, 
especially in the Middle East, 

 Recalling the decisions entitled “Strengthening the review process for the 
Treaty”, “Principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament” 
and “Extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons” and the 
resolution on the Middle East, all of which were adopted at the 1995 Review and 
Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons4 and the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference of the 
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,5  

 Recalling also the unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon States to 
accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals, leading to nuclear 
disarmament, in accordance with commitments made under article VI of the Treaty 
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,6  

 Welcoming the progress towards a follow-on agreement to the Strategic Arms

Russian Federation and of the United States of America,  

 Welcoming also the outcome of the third session of the Preparatory Committee 
for the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,7 at which the Committee adopted the 
provisional agenda and decisions relating to the organization of the work of the 
Review Conference,  

 Welcoming further the recent positive developments in the Conference on 
Disarmament, which led to the adoption of a programme of work on 29 May 2009,  

 1. Continues to emphasize the central role of the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons6 and its universality in achieving nuclear 
disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, and calls upon all States parties to 
respect their obligations; 

 2. Calls upon all States to comply fully with all commitments made 
regarding nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation and not to act in any 
way that may compromise either cause or that may lead to a new nuclear arms race;

pursue continued positive developments in that forum, in order to maintain the

spare no efforts to ensure an early start to the substantive work of the Conference at 
the beginning of its 2010 session; 

 10. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-fifth session the 
item entitled “Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: accelerating the
