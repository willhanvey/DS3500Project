 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming all its previous resolutions and statements pertaining to the 
situation between Ethiopia and Eritrea (hereinafter referred to as “the parties”) and 
the requirements contained therein, including in particular resolutions 1320 (2000), 
1430 (2002), 1466 (2003), 1640 (2005), 1681 (2006), 1710 (2006) and 1741 (2007), 

 Stressing once again its unwavering commitment to the peace process, and to 
the full and expeditious implementation of the Algiers Agreements, and the 
importance of prompt implementation of the delimitation decision of the Eritrea-
Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC) (S/2002/423) as a basis for peaceful and 
cooperative relations between the parties, 

 Reaffirming the integrity of the Temporary Security Zone (TSZ) as provided 
for in the Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities of 18 June 2000 (S/2000/601) and 
recalling the objectives of its establishment and the commitment of the parties to 
respect the TSZ, and in this regard, expressing deep concern over the continuing 
serious violations of the TSZ, 

 Underlining that the Security Council remains committed to its role, in 
particular helping to ensure that the parties respect the commitments they made in 
the Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities, 

 Commending the efforts made by the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and 
Eritrea (UNMEE) and its military and civilian personnel to accomplish its duties, 
despite the difficult circumstances, 

 Stressing further that the full demarcation of the border between the two 
parties is vital to lasting peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea as well as in the region, 
recalling that both parties under the Peace Agreement of 12 December 2000 have 
agreed to cooperate with the EEBC in the delimitation and demarcation process and 
that they also agreed that the delimitation and demarcation determinations of the 
EEBC will be final and binding, commending the efforts of the EEBC to resume 
demarcation, and expressing its regret that the EEBC, for reasons beyond its control 
as explained in the Annexes of the report of the Secretary-General of 22 January 
2007 (S/2007/33), has so far been unable to demarcate the boundary as planned, 

 Acknowledging the Statement of the EEBC of 27 November 2006,
