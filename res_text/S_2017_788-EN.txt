 Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence

the United Nations, 

 Recalling that the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as

terrorist acts, its violent extremist ideology, its continued gross, systematic and 

widespread attacks directed against civilians, its violations of international 

humanitarian law and abuses of human rights, particularly those committed against 

women and children, and including those motivated by religious or ethnic grounds, 

and its recruitment and training of foreign terrorist fighters whose threat affects  all 

regions and Member States, 

 Condemning the commission of acts by ISIL (Da’esh) involving murder, 

kidnapping, hostage-taking, suicide bombings, enslavement, sale into or otherwise

sexual violence, recruitment and use of children, attacks on critical infrastructure, as  

well as its destruction of cultural heritage, including archaeological sites, and 

trafficking of cultural property,  

 Further recognising that the commission of such acts which may amount to 

war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide, is part of the ideology and 

strategic objectives of ISIL (Da’esh), and used by ISIL (Da’esh) as a tactic of 

terrorism, and that holding ISIL (Da’esh) members accountable, particularly those

who bear the greatest responsibility, including in terms of leadership, which can 

include regional or mid-level commanders, and the ordering and commission of 

crimes, will further expose this, and could assist in countering terrorism and violent 

extremism which can be conducive to terrorism, including by stemming financing 

and the continued flow of international recruits to the terrorist group ISIL (Da’esh), 

 Welcoming the considerable efforts of the Government of Iraq to defeat ISIL 

(Da’esh), and its letter to the Secretary-General and Security Council dated 

9 August 2017 calling for the assistance of the international community to ensure 

that members of ISIL (Da’esh) are held accountable for their crimes in Iraq, 

including where those may amount to crimes against humanity (S/2017/710), 

 1. Reiterates its condemnation of all violations of international 

humanitarian law, violations and abuses of international human rights law, and acts 

of terrorism, and expresses its determination that, having united to defeat the 

terrorist group ISIL (Da’esh), those responsible in this group for such acts, 

including those that may amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity, and 

genocide, must be held accountable; 

 2. Requests the Secretary-General to establish an Investigative Team, 

headed by a Special Adviser, to support domestic efforts to hold ISIL (Da’esh) 

accountable by collecting, preserving, and storing evidence in Iraq of acts that may 

amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed by the 

terrorist group ISIL (Da’esh) in Iraq, to the highest possible standards, which should 

be addressed by the Terms of Reference referred to in paragraph 4, to ensure the 

broadest possible use before national courts, and complementing investigations 

being carried out by the Iraqi authorities, or investigations carried out by authorities 

in third countries at their request; 

 3. Underlines that the Special Adviser, while avoiding duplication of effort 

with other relevant United Nations bodies, will also promote throughout the world, 

accountability for acts that may amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity or 

genocide committed by ISIL (Da’esh), and work with survivors, in a manner 

consistent with relevant national laws, to ensure their interests in achieving 

accountability for ISIL (Da’esh) are fully recognised; 

 4. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the Security Council, for its 

approval, within 60 days, Terms of Reference acceptable to the Government of Iraq 

in order to ensure the Team can fulfil its mandate, and consistent with this 

resolution, in particular paragraph 6, regarding the operation of the Investigative 

Team in Iraq; 

 5. Underscores that the Investigative Team shall operate with full respect 

for the sovereignty of Iraq and its jurisdiction over crimes committed in its territor y, 

and that the Team’s Terms of Reference shall specify that Iraqi investigative judges, 

and other criminal experts, including experienced members of the prosecution 

services, will be appointed to the Team to work on an equal footing alongside 

international experts, and further underscores that evidence of crimes collected and 

stored by the Team in Iraq should be for eventual use in fair and independent 

criminal proceedings, consistent with applicable international law, conducted by 

competent national-level courts, with the relevant Iraqi authorities as the primary 

intended recipient as specified in the Terms of Reference, and with any other uses to 

be determined in agreement with the Government of Iraq on a case by case basis;  

 6. Emphasizes that the Team should be impartial, independent, and credible 

and should act consistent with the Terms of Reference which set out the framework 

in which the Team will operate, the Charter of the United Nations and United

Nations best practice, and relevant international law including international human 

rights law; 

 7. Requests that, after the Security Council has approved the Terms of 

Reference that are acceptable to the Government of Iraq, the Secretary -General 

undertake without delay the steps, measures, and arrangements necessary for the 

speedy establishment and full functioning of the Team, in accordance with the 

Terms of Reference, and notify it when the Team begins its work;  

 8. Underlines that the Team should ensure its Iraqi members benefit from 

international expertise on the Team, and make every effort to share knowledge and 

technical assistance with Iraq; 

 9. Encourages Member States, and regional and intergovernmental 

organisations, to provide appropriate legal assistance and capacity building to the 

Government of Iraq in order to strengthen its courts and judicial system;  

 10. Calls on all other States to cooperate with the Team including through 

mutual arrangements on legal assistance, where necessary and appropriate, and in 

particular to provide it with any relevant information as appropriate they may 

possess pertaining to its mandate under this resolution; 

 11. Underlines that another Member State in whose territory ISIL (Da’esh) 

has committed acts that may amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity, or 

genocide, may request the Team to collect evidence of such acts, but only with the 

approval of the Security Council which may request the Secretary -General to submit 

separate Terms of Reference with regards to the operation of the Team in that State;  

 12. Requests the Team to cooperate, as appropriate, and consistent with its 

investigative functions in paragraph 2, with the Analytical Support and Sanctions 

Monitoring Team established pursuant to resolution 1526 (2004) and 2368 (2017) 

and with any other relevant monitoring bodies, and to work with other United 

Nations bodies within their respective mandates; 

 13. Requests the Secretary-General to establish, as a supplement to financing 

as an expense of the Organisation, a trust fund to receive voluntary contributions to 

implement this resolution; 

 14. Calls on States, and regional and intergovernmental organisations, to 

contribute funds, equipment and services to the Team including the offer of expert 

personnel in support of the implementation of this resolution;  

 15. Requests the Special Adviser to complete the first report of the Team’s 

activities, within 90 days of the date on which it commences its activities, as 

notified by the Secretary-General, and to complete subsequent reports every 180 

days thereafter, and requests the Special Adviser to present these reports to the 

Security Council; 

 16. Decides to review the mandate of the Special Adviser and Team after a 

period of two years, with any further extension to be decided at the request of the 

Government of Iraq, or any other government that has requested the Team to collect 

evidence of acts that may amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity, or 

genocide, committed by ISIL (Da’esh) in its territory;  

 17. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
