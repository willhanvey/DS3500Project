 Recalling that marine science is important for eradicating poverty, contributing 

to food security, conserving the world’s marine environment and resources, helping 

to understand, predict and respond to natural events and promoting the sustainable 

development of the oceans and seas, by improving knowledge, through sustained 

research efforts and the evaluation of monitoring results, and applying such 

knowledge to management and decision-making,  

 Reiterating its deep concern at the serious adverse impacts on the marine 

environment and biodiversity, in particular on vulnerable marine ecosystems and 

their physical and biogenic structure, including coral reefs, cold water habitats, 

hydrothermal vents and seamounts, of certain human activi ties,  

 Emphasizing the need for the safe and environmentally sound recycling of 

ships,  

 Expressing deep concern at the adverse economic, social and environmental 

impacts of the physical alteration and destruction of marine habitats that may result 

from land-based and coastal development activities, in particular those land 

reclamation activities that are carried out in a manner that has a detrimental impact 

on the marine environment,  

 Reiterating its serious concern at the current and projected adverse effects of 

climate change and ocean acidification on the marine environment and marine 

biodiversity, and emphasizing the urgency of addressing these issues,  

 Noting with concern, in this regard, the latest findings by the World 

Meteorological Organization, in its annual “Greenhouse gas bulletin”, that, for the 

first time in 2015, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were 400 parts per 

million, on average across the year as a whole,  

 Expressing concern that climate change continues to increase the severity and 

incidence of coral bleaching throughout tropical seas and weakens the ability of 

reefs to withstand ocean acidification, which could have serious and irreversible 

negative effects on marine organisms, particularly corals, as well as to withstand 

other pressures, including overfishing and pollution,  

 Reiterating its deep concern at the vulnerability of the environment and the 

fragile ecosystems of the polar regions, including the Arctic Ocean and the Arctic 

ice cap, particularly affected by the projected adverse effects of climate change and 

ocean acidification,  

 Recognizing the need for a more integrated and ecosystem-based approach to, 

further study of and the promotion of measures for enhanced cooperation, 

coordination and collaboration relating to the conservation and sustainable use of 

marine biodiversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction,  

 Recognizing also that the realization of the benefits of the Convention could 

be enhanced by international cooperation, technical assistance and advanced 

scientific knowledge, as well as by funding and capacity-building,  

 Recognizing further that hydrographic surveys and nautical charting are 

critical to the safety of navigation and life at sea, environmental protection, 

including the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems, and the economics of the 

global shipping industry, and encouraging further efforts towards electronic 



 
A/71/L.26 

 

5/60 16-20813 

 

charting, which not only provides significantly increased benefits for safe 

navigation and management of ship movement, but also provides data and 

information that can be used for sustainable fisheries activities and other sectoral 

uses of the marine environment, the delimitation of maritime boundaries and 

environmental protection, and noting that, under the International Convention for 

the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974,
15

 ships on international voyages are required to 

carry an electronic chart display and information system, in accordance with the 

implementation schedule as set out in that Convention,  

 Recognizing that ocean data buoys deployed and operated in accordance with 

international law are critical for improving understanding of weather, climate and 

ecosystems, and that certain types of ocean data buoys contribute to saving lives by 

detecting tsunamis, and reiterating its serious concern at intentional and 

unintentional damage to such buoys,  

 Emphasizing that underwater archaeological, cultural and historical heritage, 

including shipwrecks and watercraft, holds essential information on the history of 

humankind and that such heritage is a resource that needs to be protected and 

preserved,  

 Recognizing the duty of States under article 303, paragraph 1, of the 

Convention to protect objects of an archaeological and historical nature found at sea 

and to cooperate for this purpose,  

 Expressing concern, in this regard, at various threats posed to such objects, 

including their destruction, and the illicit trafficking in such objects,  

 Recognizing that illicit trafficking in wildlife is, in some cases, committed by 

transnational organized criminal groups using maritime routes, contributes to 

damage to ecosystems and livelihoods and requires enhanced regional and global 

cooperation and coordination in response, in accordance with international law,  

 Noting with concern the continuing problem of transnational organized crime 

committed at sea, including illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic 

substances, the smuggling of migrants, trafficking in persons and illicit trafficking 

in firearms, and threats to maritime safety and security, including piracy, armed 

robbery at sea, smuggling and terrorist acts against shipping, offshore installations 

and other maritime interests, and noting the deplorable loss of life and adverse 

impact on international trade, energy security and the global economy resulting 

from such activities, 

 Reiterating the importance of the fair treatment of crew members and its 

influence on maritime safety,  

 Recognizing that fibre-optic submarine cables transmit most of the world’s 

data and communications and hence are vitally important to the global economy and 

the national security of all States, conscious that these cables are susceptible to 

intentional and accidental damage from shipping and other activities and that the 

maintenance, including the repair, of these cables is important, noting that these 

matters have been brought to the attention of States at various workshops and 

seminars, and conscious of the need for States to adopt national laws and

regulations to protect submarine cables and render their wilful damage or damage 

by culpable negligence punishable offences,  

 Noting the importance of the delineation of the outer limits of the continental 

shelf beyond 200 nautical miles and that it is in the broader interest of the 

international community that coastal States with a continental shelf beyond 

200 nautical miles submit information on the outer limits of the continental shelf 

beyond 200 nautical miles to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf 

(the Commission), and welcoming the submissions to the Commission by a 

considerable number of States Parties to the Convention on the outer limits of their 

continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, that the Commission has continued to 

fulfil its role, including of making recommendations to coastal States, and that the 

summaries of recommendations are being made publicly available,
16

 

 Noting also that many coastal States Parties have submitted preliminary 

information indicative of the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond 

200 nautical miles, as provided for in the decision of the eighteenth Meeting of 

States Parties to the Convention regarding the workload of the Commission and the 

ability of States, particularly developing States, to fulfil the requirements of article 

4 of annex II to the Convention, as well as the decision contained in SPLOS/72, 

paragraph (a),
17

 

 Noting further that some coastal States may continue to face particular 

challenges in relation to preparing and presenting submissions to the Commission,  

 Noting that financial and technical assistance may be sought by developing 

countries for activities in relation to preparing and presenting submissions to the 

Commission, including through the voluntary trust fund established by the General 

Assembly in its resolution 55/7 of 30 October 2000 for the purpose of facilitating 

the preparation of submissions to the Commission for developing States, in 

particular the least developed countries and small island developing States, and 

compliance with article 76 of the Convention, as well as other accessible 

international assistance,  

 Recognizing the importance of the trust funds established pursuant to 

resolution 55/7 in facilitating the participation of members of the Commission from 

developing States in the meetings of the Commission and in fulfilling the 

requirements of article 4 of annex II to the Convention, noting with appreciation the 

recent contributions made to them, while observing with concern that the lack of 

funds in the voluntary trust fund for the purpose of defraying the cost of the 

participation in its meetings of the members of the Commission from developing 

States may prevent the Commission from implementing the decision of the twenty -

sixth Meeting of States Parties that requested the Commission to meet for up to 

26 weeks, and may preclude the Commission from advancing its work as a result of 

the potential lack of quorum at the 2017 sessions, and in this regard urging States, 

international financial institutions, donor agencies, intergovernmental organizations, 

non-governmental organizations and natural and juridical persons to contribute to 

the trust fund,

 Recognizing that practical difficulties can arise when there is a considerable 

delay between the preparation of submissions and their consideration by the 

Commission, including in retaining expertise up to and during the consideration of 

the submissions by the Commission,  

 Recognizing also the significant workload of the Commission in view of the 

large number of submissions already received and a number of submissions yet to be 

received, which places additional demands and challenges on its members and the 

secretariat as provided by the Secretary-General of the United Nations through the 

Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea of the Office of Legal Affairs of 

the Secretariat (the Division), and welcoming the decision of the twenty -first Meeting 

of States Parties to the Convention regarding the workload of the Commission,
18

 

 Noting with concern the projected timetable of the work of the Commission on 

the submissions already received by it and those yet to be received, and in this 

regard noting the decision of the twenty-sixth Meeting of States Parties to the 

Convention to renew the request made by the twenty-first Meeting of States Parties 

to the Convention and to request the Commission to consider, in coordination with 

the Secretariat, as from 16 June 2017, within the existing resources made available 

to the Secretariat, that the Commission, and its subcommissions meeting 

simultaneously as far as possible, meet at Headquarters for up to 26 weeks but not 

less than an intended minimum of 21 weeks a year for a period of five years, 

distributed in such a way that the Commission determines to be the most effective, 

and that no two sessions be sequential, and to request the Commission to prepare a 

plan of sessions to be held in 2017 on the basis of that request,
19

 

 Recognizing the need to ensure that the Commission can perform its functions 

under the Convention expeditiously, efficiently and effectively and maintain its  high 

level of quality and expertise,  

 Expressing concern about the implications of the workload of the Commission 

for the conditions of service of its members,  

 Recalling, in this regard, the decisions of the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth 

Meetings of States Parties to the Convention regarding the conditions of service of  

the members of the Commission,
20

 

 Recalling also its decision, in resolutions 57/141 of 12 December 2002 and 

58/240 of 23 December 2003, to establish a regular process under the United
