stressing that such cuts should be irreversible, verifiable and transparent,

items, 

 Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration,15 in which Heads of

conference to identify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers, 

 Recalling also the statement on the total elimination of nuclear weapons,

by-step reduction of the nuclear threat and to carry out effective nuclear 
disarmament measures with a view to achieving the total elimination of these 
weapons within a specified framework of time;

instrument on security assurances of non-use and non-threat of use of nuclear 
weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States;
