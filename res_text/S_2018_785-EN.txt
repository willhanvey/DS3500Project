 The Security Council,  

 Recalling its previous resolutions, in particular resolutions 2423 (2018), 2391 

(2017) and 2374 (2017),  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, unity and territorial 

integrity of Mali, emphasizing that the Malian authorities have primary responsibility 

for the provision of stability and security throughout the territory of Mali, and 

underscoring the importance of achieving national ownership of peace- and security-

related initiatives,  

 Taking note of the renewed commitment of the Government of Mali, the 

Plateforme coalition of armed groups and the Coordination des Mouvements de 

l’Azawad coalition of armed groups (“the Plateforme and Coordination armed 

groups”) to the expeditious implementation of all of their remaining obligations under 

the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali (“the Agreement”), through the 

adoption of a “Chronogramme d’actions prioritaires” during the meeting of the 

Comité de Suivi de l’Accord (CSA) held in Bamako on the 15 and 16 January 2018, 

followed by the adoption of a Roadmap for its implementation on 22 March 2018 

(“the Roadmap”),  

 Welcoming the recent positive steps achieved in the implementation of the 

Agreement, while expressing its deep frustration that parties have too long stalled the 

implementation of the Agreement, in spite of significant international support and 

assistance, further expressing a significant sense of impatience with parties over the 

persistent delays in the full implementation of key provisions of the Agreement and 

stressing the absolute urgency for the Government of Mali and the Plateforme and 

Coordination armed groups to take unprecedented steps to fully and expeditiously 

deliver on remaining obligations under the Agreement,  

 Stressing that all parties to the Agreement share the primary responsibility to 

make steadfast progress in its implementation,  

 Recalling the provisions of the Agreement calling upon the Security Council to 

give its full support to the Agreement, to closely monitor its implementation and, if 

necessary, to take measures against anyone hindering the implementation of the 

commitments contained therein or the realisation of its objectives,  

 Recalling the provisions of resolution 2423 (2018) expressing the intention of 

the Security Council to follow closely the timely implementation of the Road map 

referred to above and to respond with measures pursuant to resolution 2374 (2017)
