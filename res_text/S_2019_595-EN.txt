  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 

draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council,  

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 16 April on his Good Offices 

(S/2019/322) and of 10 July on the United Nations operation in Cyprus (S/2019/562), 

further welcoming the Secretary-General’s willingness, and expressing its full support 

for his Good Offices to remain available to assist the sides, should they jointly decide 

to re-engage in negotiations with the necessary political will,  

 Underscoring that the responsibility for finding a solution lies first and foremost 

with the Cypriots themselves, and reaffirming the primary role of the United Nations 

in assisting the parties to bring the Cyprus conflict and division of the island to a 

comprehensive and durable settlement with a sense of urgency,  

 Noting the progress made towards a comprehensive settlement up to and 

including the Conference on Cyprus in June 2017, including the commitments in the 

leaders’ Joint Statement of 2 April 2017 on the basis of the Joint Declaration of 

11 February 2014, and recalling the six points of the Secretary-General’s framework 

presented on 30 June 2017 as a way to move forward to close the remaining gaps,  

 Urging the sides to renew their efforts to achieve an enduring, comprehensive 

and just settlement based on a bicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality, 

as set out in relevant Security Council resolutions, including OP4 of its resolution 

716 (1991), and stressing that the status quo is unsustainable,  

 Expressing concern at the increased tensions in the eastern Mediterranean over 

hydrocarbons exploration, convinced of the many important benefits, including 

economic benefits for all Cypriots that would flow from a comprehensive and durable 

settlement, and reiterating the Secretary-General’s call for serious efforts to avoid 

any further escalation and to defuse tensions, 

 Recalling its resolution 1325 (2000) and related resolutions, recognising that 

the active and meaningful participation and leadership of women is essential in 

building peace in Cyprus and will contribute to making any future settlement  

sustainable, welcoming efforts to bring together a broader range of women actors on 

both sides, and looking forward to the outcome of the gender-sensitive socio-

economic impact assessment requested in its resolution 2453 (2019), 

 Emphasising the importance of confidence-building measures and their timely 

implementation, and urging the sides to step up their efforts to promote 

intercommunal contacts, reconciliation and the active engagement of civil society, in 

particular women and youth,

 Welcoming measures to date to strengthen the liaison and engagement capacity
