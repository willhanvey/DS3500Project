 Welcoming the ongoing work by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer 

Space on the implementation of the 21 Guidelines for the Long-term Sustainability 

of Outer Space Activities,2 which may have a positive effect on international peace 

and security, 

 Emphasizing the need to maintain outer space as a peaceful, safe, stable, secure 

and sustainable environment for the benefit of all and the significant contribution of 

outer space activities to social, economic, scientific and technological development, 

as well as to international peace and security,  

 Urging all States, when developing, planning and executing their space 

activities, to remain committed to the peaceful exploration and use of outer space and 

to refrain from conducting activities contrary to their obligations under international 

law, including those that could threaten the ability of all States to freely use and 

explore outer space, now and in the future,  

 Stressing that the creation of long-lived orbital debris arising from the deliberate 

destruction of space systems increases the risk of in-orbit collisions and the potential 

for misunderstanding and miscalculations that could lead to conflict,  

 Seriously concerned about the possibility of an arms race in outer space, and 

reaffirming that the prevention of an arms race in outer space would avert a grave 

danger for international peace and security, as well as being an essential condition for 

the promotion and strengthening of international cooperat ion in the exploration and 

use of outer space for peaceful purposes,  

 Recalling paragraph 80 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of 

the General Assembly, in which it is stated that, in order to prevent an arms race in 

outer space, further measures should be taken and appropriate international 

negotiations held in accordance with the spirit of the Treaty on Principles Governing 

the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon 

and Other Celestial Bodies, 

 Convinced that possible solutions to outer space security can involve a 

combination of legally binding obligations and political commitments, and that work 

in both of these areas can be further pursued in a progressive, sustained and 

complementary manner, without undermining existing legal obligations,  

 Recalling the primary role of the Conference on Disarmament on questions 

relating to the prevention of an arms race in outer space in all its aspects, including 

the weaponization of outer space and threats from capabilities on Earth, and the 

relevant responsibilities of the First Committee of the General Assembly and the 

Disarmament Commission, 

 Noting the rapid advances of technologies in space systems, the use of which 

could have positive or negative effects on international security, and encouraging 

further discussion among States of the impact of these developments,  

 Recognizing that efforts to prevent an arms race and to prevent conflict from 

beginning in or extending into outer space must include consideration of the use of 

all potential technologies and means, whether on Earth or in outer space,  

 Stressing that uses of these technologies and means for purposes inconsistent 

with the objectives of maintaining international stability and security, including 

against signals for operators and users and the terrestrial infrastructure supporting 

space systems, can lead to the perception of threats on Earth as well as in outer space

and can have destabilizing effects on peace and security, and that such threats al ready 

exist in outer space and on Earth,  

 Recognizing the need for States to seek to avoid and mitigate the potential 

impact on peace and security arising from accidents, miscommunication or a lack of 

transparency, which could lead to miscalculations and the escalation of tensions and 

contribute to an arms race, 

 Reiterating the need for all States to work together to reduce threats to space 

systems through the further development and implementation of norms, rules and 

principles of responsible behaviours with the aim of maintaining a peaceful, safe, 

stable, secure and sustainable outer space environment, which might, as appropriate 

and without prejudice, contribute to further consideration of legally binding 

instruments on the prevention of an arms race in outer space, 

 Reaffirming that verification is one of the essential components of legally 

binding arms control instruments, and encouraging further consideration of effective 

verification regarding space systems,  

 Recognizing the importance of the full involvement and equal participation of 

women and men in discussions on reducing space threats through responsible 

behaviours and the need to assess the possible differentiated impacts of such threats,  

 1. Affirms that all States must conduct their activities in the exploration and 

use of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, in conformity with 

international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, and urges Member 

States to take this into account when formulating their space policies; 

 2. Encourages those States that have not yet become parties to the 

international treaties governing the exploration and use of outer space to give 

consideration to ratifying or acceding to those treaties in accordance with their 

national law, as well as incorporating them into their national legislation;  

 3. Expresses the desire that all Member States reach a common understanding 

of how best to act to reduce threats to space systems in order to maintain outer space 

as a peaceful, safe, stable and sustainable environment, free from an arms race and 

conflict, for the benefit of all, and consider establishing channels of direct 

communication, including for the management of perceptions of threat;  

 4. Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly 

pursuant to its resolution 75/36,3 and his recommendation that Member States study 

the ideas contained therein and decide on an inclusive process to take these issues 

forward at the seventy-sixth session of the General Assembly;  

 5. Decides to convene, beginning in 2022, an open-ended working group to: 

 (a) Take stock of the existing international legal and other normative 

frameworks concerning threats arising from State behaviours with respect to outer 

space; 

 (b) Consider current and future threats by States to space systems, and actions, 

activities and omissions that could be considered irresponsible;  

 (c) Make recommendations on possible norms, rules and principles of 

responsible behaviours relating to threats by States to space systems, including, as 

appropriate, how they would contribute to the negotiation of legally binding 

instruments, including on the prevention of an arms race in outer space;  

 (d) Submit a report to the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session;

 6. Also decides that the open-ended working group shall work on the basis of 

consensus, hold its organizational session in Geneva for two days, and meet in Geneva 

for two sessions of five days each in both 2022 and 2023, with the participation of 

intergovernmental organizations and other entities having received a standing 

invitation to participate as observers in the work of the General Assembly, as well as 

organizations and bodies of the United Nations, and with the attendance of other 

international organizations, commercial actors and civil society representatives, in 

accordance with established practice, and further decides that the Chair may also hold 

intersessional consultative meetings with interested parties to  exchange views on the 

issues within the mandate of the open-ended working group; 

 7. Requests the Secretary-General to provide all necessary assistance to the 

open-ended working group and its Chair and to transmit its report to the Conference 

on Disarmament and the Disarmament Commission;  

 8. Continues to invite States members and observers of the Conference on 

Disarmament and the Disarmament Commission to inform those bodies of their 

national space security policies, strategies or doctrines, on a voluntary basis, in 

accordance with and in support of the mandates of those bodies; 

 9. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-seventh 

session, under the item entitled “Prevention of an arms race in outer space”, a sub -item 

entitled “Reducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of respo nsible 

behaviours”.
