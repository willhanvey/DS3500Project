established by resolution 2041 (2012),  

 Recalling its resolutions on the recruitment and use of children and armed 
conflict, 

 Expressing its strong concern about the security situation in Afghanistan, in 
particular the ongoing violent and terrorist activities by the Taliban, Al-Qaida, 
illegal armed groups, criminals and those involved in the narcotics trade, and the 
strong links between terrorism activities and illicit drugs, resulting in threats to the 
local population, including children, national security forces and international 
military and civilian personnel, 

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial 
integrity and national unity of Afghanistan,  

 Stressing the importance of a comprehensive political process in Afghanistan 
to support reconciliation among all Afghans,  

 Recognizing that the security situation in Afghanistan has evolved and that 
some members of the Taliban have reconciled with the Government of Afghanistan, 
have rejected the terrorist ideology of Al-Qaida and its followers, and support a 
peaceful resolution to the continuing conflict in Afghanistan, 

 Recognizing that notwithstanding the evolution of the situation in Afghanistan 
and progress in reconciliation, the situation in Afghanistan remains a threat to 
international peace and security, and reaffirming the need to combat this threat by 
all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international 
law, including applicable human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, stressing in 
this regard the important role the United Nations plays in this effort,

the Afghan Constitution and application of the procedures introduced by the 
Security Council in its resolution 1988 (2011) as well as other relevant resolutions

its followers, and to support a peaceful resolution to the continuing conflict in

associated with the Taliban in constituting a threat to the peace, stability and 
security of Afghanistan, to accept the Government of Afghanistan’s offer of 
reconciliation, 

 Reiterating the need to ensure that the present sanctions regime contributes 
effectively to ongoing efforts to combat the insurgency and support the Government 
of Afghanistan’s work to advance reconciliation in order to bring about peace, 
stability, and security in Afghanistan,  

 Taking note of the Government of Afghanistan’s request that the Security 
Council support national reconciliation, including by removing names from the 
United Nations sanctions lists for those who reconcile, and, therefore, have ceased 
to engage in or support activities that threaten the peace, stability and security of 
Afghanistan, 

 Expressing its intention to give due regard to lifting sanctions on those who 
reconcile,  

 Welcoming the appointment of the new chairman of the High Peace Council in 
April 2012 as an important step in the Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace and 
reconciliation process, 

 Stressing the central and impartial role that the United Nations continues to 
play in promoting peace, stability and security in Afghanistan, and expressing its 
appreciation and strong support for the ongoing efforts of the Secretary-General and
