brought to justice, 

 Taking note of the letter to the President of the Council from the Secretary-

problems in the relocation of acquitted persons and convicted persons who have 

completed serving their sentences, emphasizing the importance of the successful 

relocation of such persons, and, also noting the assumption of responsibility of the 

Mechanism for such persons from 1 January 2015,
