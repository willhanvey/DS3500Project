28 September 2001, 1535 (2004) of 26 March 2004, 1540 (2004) of 28 April 2004,
1566 (2004) of 8 October 2004, and 1617 (2005) of 29 July 2005, the declaration
annexed to its resolution 1456 (2003) of 20 January 2003, as well as its other
resolutions concerning threats to international peace and security caused by acts of
terrorism,

Reaffirming also the imperative to combat terrorism in all its forms and
manifestations by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations,
and also stressing that States must ensure that any measures taken to combat
terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, and should adopt
such measures in accordance with international law, in particular international
human rights law, refugee law, and humanitarian law,

Condemning in the strongest terms all acts of terrorism irrespective of their
motivation, whenever and by whomsoever committed, as one of the most serious
threats to peace and security, and reaffirming the primary responsibility of the
Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security under the
Charter of the United Nations,

Condemning also in the strongest terms the incitement of terrorist acts and
repudiating attempts at the justification or glorification (apologie) of terrorist acts
that may incite further terrorist acts,

Deeply concerned that incitement of terrorist acts motivated by extremism and
intolerance poses a serious and growing danger to the enjoyment of human rights,
threatens the social and economic development of all States, undermines global
stability and prosperity, and must be addressed urgently and proactively by the
United Nations and all States, and emphasizing the need to take all necessary and
appropriate measures in accordance with international law at the national and
international level to protect the right to life,

Recalling the right to freedom of expression reflected in Article 19 of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the General Assembly in 1948
(“the Universal Declaration”), and recalling also the right to freedom of expression
in Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights adopted by
the General Assembly in 1966 (“ICCPR”) and that any restrictions thereon shall

only be such as are provided by law and are necessary on the grounds set out in
paragraph 3 of Article 19 of the ICCPR,

Recalling in addition the right to seek and enjoy asylum reflected in Article 14
of the Universal Declaration and the non-refoulement obligation of States under the
Convention relating to the Status of Refugees adopted on 28 July 1951, together
with its Protocol adopted on 31 January 1967 (“the Refugees Convention and its
Protocol”), and also recalling that the protections afforded by the Refugees
Convention and its Protocol shall not extend to any person with respect to whom
there are serious reasons for considering that he has been guilty of acts contrary to
the purposes and principles of the United Nations,

Reaffirming that acts, methods, and practices of terrorism are contrary to the
purposes and principles of the United Nations and that knowingly financing,
planning and inciting terrorist acts are also contrary to the purposes and principles
of the United Nations,

Deeply concerned by the increasing number of victims, especially among
civilians of diverse nationalities and beliefs, caused by terrorism motivated by
intolerance or extremism in various regions of the world, reaffirming its profound
solidarity with the victims of terrorism and their families, and stressing the
importance of assisting victims of terrorism and providing them and their families
with support to cope with their loss and grief,

Recognizing the essential role of the United Nations in the global effort to
combat terrorism and welcoming the Secretary-General’s identification of elements

promote comprehensive, coordinated and consistent responses at the national,
regional and international level to counter terrorism,

Stressing its call upon all States to become party, as a matter of urgency, to the
international counter-terrorism Conventions and Protocols whether or not they are
party to regional Conventions on the matter, and to give priority consideration to
signing the International Convention for the Suppression of Nuclear Terrorism
adopted by the General Assembly on 13 April 2005,

Re-emphasizing that continuing international efforts to enhance dialogue and
broaden understanding among civilizations, in an effort to prevent the
indiscriminate targeting of different religions and cultures, and addressing
unresolved regional conflicts and the full range of global issues, including
development issues, will contribute to strengthening the international fight against
terrorism,

Stressing the importance of the role of the media, civil and religious society,
the business community and educational institutions in those efforts to enhance
dialogue and broaden understanding, and in promoting tolerance and coexistence,
and in fostering an environment which is not conducive to incitement of terrorism,

Recognizing the importance that, in an increasingly globalized world, States
act cooperatively to prevent terrorists from exploiting sophisticated technology,
communications and resources to incite support for criminal acts,

Recalling that all States must cooperate fully in the fight against terrorism, in
accordance with their obligations under international law, in order to find, deny safe

from entering their territory;

and broaden understanding among civilizations, in an effort to prevent the
