United States of America: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its resolutions 2314 (2016), 2235 (2015), 2209 (2015) and 2118 

(2013), 

 Noting that additional allegations of chemical weapons use in Syria are being 

investigated by the Fact-Finding Mission of the Organization for the Prohibition of 

Chemical Weapons (OPCW), 

 Condemning again in the strongest terms any use of any toxic chemicals as a 

weapon in the Syrian Arab Republic and expressing alarm that civilians continue to 

be killed and injured by toxic chemicals as weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic,  

 Reaffirming that the use of chemical weapons constitutes a serious violation of 

international law and reiterating that those individuals, entities, groups or 

governments responsible for any use of chemical weapons must be held 

accountable, 

 Reaffirming their grave concern that the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant 

(ISIL, also known as Da’esh), and other individuals, groups, undertakings, and 

entities associated with ISIL (Da’esh) or Al-Qaida, including but not limited to 

foreign terrorist fighters who have joined ISIL (Da’esh) in Syria, groups that have 

pledged allegiance to ISIL (Da’esh), and Al-Nusra Front (ANF), continue operating 

in the Syrian Arab Republic, 

 Stressing the need for all Member States to fully comply with their obligations 

under resolution 2178 (2014), 

 Recalling that in resolution 2118 the Council underscored that no party in 

Syria should use, develop, produce, acquire, stockpile, retain or transfer chemical 

weapons and decided that member States shall inform immediately the Security 

Council of any violations of resolution 1540 including acquisitions by non-State 

actors of chemical weapons, their means of delivery and related materials in order to 

take necessary measures therefore,  

 1. Decides to renew the mandate of the Joint investigative Mechanism, as 

set out in resolution 2235, for a further period of one year from the date of adoption 

of this resolution, with a possibility of further extension and update by the Security 

Council if it deems necessary;

 2. Recalls its decision that the Syrian Arab Republic shall not use, develop, 

produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile or retain chemical weapons, or, transfer, 

directly or indirectly, chemical weapons to other States or non -State actors; 

 3. Reaffirms paragraphs 1, 3-4, 6, 8, 9, 12, and 15 of resolution 2235;  

 4. Encourages the Joint Investigative Mechanism, where relevant, to 

consult appropriate United Nations counter-terrorism and non-proliferation bodies, 

in particular the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1540 and 

1267/1989/2253 ISIL (Da’esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee, in order to 

exchange information on non-State actor perpetration, organization, sponsorship, or 

other involvement in use of chemicals as weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic 

where the OPCW Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) determines or has determined that a 

specific incident in the Syrian Arab Republic involved or likely involved the use of 

chemicals as weapons; 

 5. Invites the Joint Investigative Mechanism to engage relevant regional 

States in pursuit of its mandate, including in order to identify to the greatest extent 

feasible any individuals, entities or groups associated with ISIL (Da’esh) or ANF 

who were perpetrators, organizers, sponsors or otherwise involved in the use of 

chemicals as weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic where the OPCW FFM 

determines or has determined that a specific incident in the Syrian Arab Republic 

involved or likely involved the use of chemicals as weapons, encourages relevant 

regional states to provide, as appropriate, to the Joint Investigative Mechanism 

information on non-State actors’ access to chemical weapons and their components 

or efforts by non-State actors to develop, acquire, manufacture, possess, transport, 

transfer or use chemical weapons and their means of delivery that occur under their 

jurisdiction, including relevant information from national investigations, and 

underscores the importance of States Parties’ obligations under Article VII of the 

Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use 

of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction (CWC), and the full implementation 

of paragraph 8 of resolution 2235, including with respect to information pertaining 

to non-State actors; 

 6. Recalls Article X.8 and X.9 of the CWC allowing any State Party to 

request and receive assistance and protection against the use or threat of use of 

chemical weapons if it considers that chemical weapons have been used against it, 

recalls further that such requests, substantiated by relevant information, are 

transmitted by the Director General of the OPCW to the Executive Council and all 

States Parties to the CWC, and invites the Joint Investigative Mechanism to offer its 

services to the OPCW in such circumstances if relevant to effectively fulfilling the 

Joint Investigative Mechanism’s mandate;  

 7. Reaffirms paragraph 7 of resolution 2235, including with respect to the 

ability of the Joint Investigative Mechanism to examine additional information and 

evidence that was not obtained or prepared by the FFM but that is related to the 

mandate of the Joint Investigative Mechanism, and stresses the need for its full 

implementation, in particular the provision of information requested by the Joint 

Investigative Mechanism and the making available of witnesses;  



 
S/2016/974 

 

3/3 16-20443

90 days of adoption of this resolution, and complete subsequent reports as 

appropriate thereafter, and requests the Joint Investigative Mechanism to present the 

report, or reports, to the United Nations Security Council and inform the OPCW 

Executive Council, and invites the Joint Investigative Mechanism to brief, as 

appropriate, the 1540 Committee, the 1267/1989/2253 Committee or other relevant 

counter-terrorism or non-proliferation bodies on relevant results of their work;
