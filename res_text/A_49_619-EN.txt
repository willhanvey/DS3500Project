area of operation,

effected and that, therefore, the situation of the refugees continues to be a
matter of concern;

2. Expresses its thanks to the Commissioner-General and to all the staff
of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near
East, recognizing that the Agency is doing all it can within the limits of

Refugees in the Near East as soon as possible and in any case before the
