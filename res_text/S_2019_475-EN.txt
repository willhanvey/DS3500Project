 Noting the report of the Secretary-General on the Protection of Civilians in 

Armed Conflict of 07 May 2019 (S/2019/373), and the relevant conclusions contained 

therein,  

 Noting that this year marks the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions of 

1949, which together with their Additional Protocols are a key part of the legal 

framework for the protection of civilians in armed conflict,  

 Noting further that this year also marks the 20th anniversary of the progressive 

consideration by the Security Council of the protection of civilians in armed conflict 

as a thematic issue; and acknowledging the enduring need for the Security Council 

and Member States to strengthen further the protection of civilians in armed conflict,  

 Urging States which have not yet done so to consider becoming parties to 

Additional Protocols I and II of 1977 to the Geneva Conventions at the earliest 

possible date,  

 Reaffirming that parties to armed conflict bear the primary responsibility to take 

all feasible steps to ensure the protection of civilians and recalls that States bear the 

primary responsibility to respect and ensure the human rights of all individuals within 

their territory and subject to their jurisdiction, as provided for by relevant 

international law,  

 Stressing the important contribution of measures to prevent persons from going 

missing as a result of armed conflict, including, inter alia; enacting national 

legislation, ensuring detainee registration, providing appropriate training for armed 

forces, producing and providing proper means of identification, including for 

members of armed forces, the establishment of national information bureaus upon the 

outbreak of an armed conflict, grave registration services and registers of deaths and 

ensuring accountability as appropriate in cases of missing persons,  

 Cognizant of the great scientific and technological progress which has 

significantly increased the efficacy of the search for and identification of missing 

persons including through, inter alia; forensic sciences, DNA analysis, satellite maps 

and imagery, and ground penetrating radar,  

 Emphasizing the importance of the principles of humanity, neutrality, 

impartiality and independence in the provision of humanitarian assistance and 

reaffirming also the need for actors engaged in the provision of such assistance in 

situations of armed conflict to promote and fully respect these principles; and recalls, 

in this regard, the statement of its President of 9 March 2000 (S/PRST/2000/7),  

 Reiterating strong support for the efforts of the international organizations, in 

particular, International Committee of the Red Cross in addressing the issue of 

missing persons, consistent with the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their 

Additional Protocols of 1977, and appreciating the work of the national, regional and 

international organizations and mechanisms in this field,  

 Expressing its concern about the dramatic increase in persons reported missing 

as a result of armed conflict, which entails consequences for the missing persons 

themselves and for their families, especially women and children, and communities 

in the immediate and long-term, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of 

allowing families to know the fate and whereabouts of their missing relatives, 

consistent with applicable international humanitarian law, which is of crucial 

humanitarian importance,  

 Recognizing that it is critical for States to address the issue holistically, from 

prevention to tracing the location, identifying missing persons and returning human 

remains to their families, without adverse distinction, that informed and early action 

is crucial for addressing cases of missing persons in an effective and credible manner,

S/2019/475 

 

3/5 19-09428 

 

and that the manner in which these cases are addressed affects relations between 

parties to armed conflict and efforts to resolve conflicts,  

 Recognizing the importance of truth, justice and accountability in efforts 

towards reconciliation and the peaceful settlement of conflicts, and the end of 

impunity,  

 Acknowledging that full and timely support for humanitarian components can 

be critical in ensuring and enhancing the sustainability of any peace agreement and 

post-conflict peacebuilding and emphasizes the importance of inclusion of 

humanitarian elements in peace negotiations and agreements, including the issue of 

prisoners of war, detainees and missing persons and others protected by international 

humanitarian law,  

 1. Reaffirms its strong condemnation of the deliberate targeting of civilians 

or other protected persons in situations of armed conflict, and calls upon all parties to 

armed conflict to put an end to such practices, in accordance with their obligations 

under international humanitarian law;  

 2. Calls upon parties to armed conflict to take all appropriate measures, to 

actively search for persons reported missing, to enable the return of their remains, 

and to account for persons reported missing without adverse distinction and to put in 

place appropriate channels enabling response and communication with families on 

the search process, and to consider the provision of information on available services 

in relation to administrative, legal, economic and psychosocial difficulties and needs 

they may face as a result of having a missing relative, including through an interaction 

with competent national and international organizations and institutions;  

 3. Calls upon parties to armed conflict to take appropriate measures to 

prevent persons from going missing as a result of armed conflict, through the 

facilitation of the reunion of families dispersed as a result of armed conflict, and to 

allow for the exchange of family news, consistent with their international obligations;  

 4. Calls upon parties to armed conflict to pay the utmost attention to cases of 

children reported missing as a result of armed conflict, and to take appropriate 

measures to search for and identify those children;  

 5. Calls upon parties to armed conflict to register and notify the personal 

details of persons deprived of their liberty, including prisoners of war, as a res ult of 

armed conflict, and belonging to the adverse party, and allow them to correspond with 

their families, consistent with their international obligations;  

 6. Further calls upon States, in cases of missing persons as a result of armed 

conflict, to take measures, as appropriate, in order to ensure thorough, prompt, 

impartial and effective investigations and the prosecution of offences linked to 

missing persons as a result of armed conflict, in accordance with national and 

international law, with a view to full accountability;  

 7. Urges parties to armed conflict to collect, protect, and manage all relevant 

data and documents on missing persons as a result of armed conflict while respecting 

privacy, consistent with applicable national and international law;   

 8. Urges parties to armed conflict to search for and recover the dead as a 

result of armed conflict, identify them, including by recording all available 

information and mapping the location of burial sites, to respect the remains of the 

dead, including by respecting and properly maintaining their graves, and to return 

them, whenever possible, to their relatives, consistent with applicable obligations 

under international humanitarian law and human rights law; as it relates to personal 

data protection, to refrain from deliberate relocation of remains from mass graves, to 

avoid excavation and recovery efforts by untrained persons that result in the damage 



S/2019/475 
 

 

19-09428 4/5 

 

or destruction of human remains, and to ensure that, in any exhumation or recovery 

effort, data possibly leading to the identification of the deceased person is adequately 

collected and recorded;  

 9. Urges parties to armed conflict to establish national information bureaus 

or other mechanisms, upon the outbreak of a conflict, to exchange information on 

detainees and civilians belonging to an adverse party, to transmit such information to 

that party, with the support of the Central Tracing Agency as a neutral intermediary, 

where appropriate, and to open enquiries regarding these persons;  

 10. Reiterates its support for the efforts of the ICRC in seeking access to 

information on persons reported missing and calls on all parties to armed conflict to 

comply with their commitments in respect to such access and to cooperate with the 

ICRC and its Central Tracing Agency in addressing the issue of missing persons, 

consistent with applicable obligations under international humanitarian law;  

 11. Stresses the importance of strengthening the role and capacity of the 

existing national, regional and international mechanisms that assist in addressing the 

issue of missing persons as a result of armed conflict, to provide advice and support 

to Member States, other national, international and regional organizations and 

mechanisms in this field to provide training, to exchange,  as appropriate, on 

respective registries of missing persons cases, and to share best practices in close 

cooperation with all relevant organisations;  

 12. Urges all parties to armed conflict to allow safe and unimpeded access of 

humanitarian personnel, including those engaged in the search for and identification 

of missing persons or their remains as soon as circumstances permit;  

 13. Calls upon all Member States to engage in networking, exchange of 

experience, best practices and technical recommendations, and other means of 

cooperation and coordination with state institutions, and, as appropriate, with national 

commissions on missing persons, competent regional and international organizations 

and mechanisms;  

 14. Underscores that accountability for missing persons as a result of armed 

conflict can be among the components of the design and implementation of peace 

negotiations and agreements and peacebuilding processes, including with reference 

to justice and rule of law mechanisms;  

 15. Calls upon all parties to armed conflict, when negotiating and 

implementing peace agreements, to include provisions to facilitate the search for 

missing persons and to take all necessary steps to protect victims and witnesses 

testifying on those reported missing in order to end impunity;  

 16. Underscores that the steps set out in this resolution can contribute to the 

process of confidence building between parties to armed conflict, expediting peace 

negotiations and settlement, transitional justice processes, reconciliation, 

peacebuilding and sustaining peace;  

 17. Encourages Member States to increase their voluntary financial, technical 

training and logistical assistance for states, upon their request, in support of 

exhumation and identification processes relevant to the search for missing persons as 

a result of armed conflict, in particular to advance forensic scientific and 

methodological efforts for the recovery, identification and management of bodies or 

human remains in a way that respects human dignity;  

 18. Encourages the relevant United Nations Secretary-General’s special 

representatives, envoys, coordinators and advisors to take into account, while 

implementing their respective mandates, the issue of missing persons as a result of 

armed conflict;  



 
S/2019/475 

 

5/5 19-09428 

 

 19. Requests the Secretary-General to include as a sub-item in the reports on 

the protection of civilians the issue of missing persons as a result of armed conflict, 

including measures undertaken by parties to armed conflict in the implementation of 

the provisions of this resolution, and to brief the Security Council every twelve 

months on the implementation of the resolution, within the annual briefing on the 

protection of civilians.
