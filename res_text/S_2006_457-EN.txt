 Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General dated 13 June 2006

violence;

stipulated in paragraphs 4 and 5 of resolution 1565, inter alia, to provide assistance 
to the transitional government and authorities in order to contribute to their efforts, 
including those carried out with the support of EUSEC, with a view to take forward
