  Taking forward multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Deeply concerned about the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any 
use of nuclear weapons, 

 Recalling the Declaration of the Tenth Special Session of the General 
Assembly, the first special session devoted to disarmament,1 which states, inter alia, 
that all the peoples of the world have a vital interest in the success of disarmament 
negotiations, and that all States have the right to participate in disarmament 
negotiations, 

 Mindful of the role and functions of the Conference on Disarmament and the 
Disarmament Commission, 

 Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration,2 which states, inter alia, 
that responsibility for managing worldwide economic and social development, as 
well as threats to international peace and security, must be shared among the nations 
of the world and should be exercised multilaterally and that, as the most universal 
and most representative organization in the world, the United Nations must play the 
central role, 

 Welcoming the efforts by Member States to secure progress in multilateral 
disarmament and the support of the Secretary-General for such efforts, and noting in 
this regard the Secretary-General’s five-point proposal on nuclear disarmament,

 Recalling the outcome, including the action points, of the 2010 Review 
Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons,3 

 Reaffirming the absolute validity of multilateral diplomacy in the field of 
disarmament and non-proliferation, and determined to promote multilateralism as an 
essential way to develop arms regulation and disarmament negotiations, 

 Recognizing the absence of concrete outcomes of multilateral nuclear 
disarmament negotiations within the United Nations framework for more than a 
decade, 

 Recognizing also the increased political attention to disarmament and  
non-proliferation issues and that the international political climate is more 
conducive to the promotion of multilateral disarmament and moving towards the 
goal of a world without nuclear weapons, 

 Emphasizing the importance and urgency of substantive progress on priority 
disarmament and non-proliferation issues, 

 Recognizing the important contribution that civil society makes to multilateral 
disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control processes, 

 Mindful of Article 11 of the Charter of the United Nations concerning the 
functions and powers of the General Assembly to consider and make 
recommendations, inter alia recommendations with regard to disarmament, 

 1. Decides to establish an open-ended working group to develop proposals 
to take forward multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations for the achievement 
and maintenance of a world without nuclear weapons; 

 2. Also decides that the working group will convene in Geneva in 2013 for 
up to three weeks, with the contribution of international organizations and civil 
society, in accordance with established practice, and will hold its organizational 
session as soon as possible; 

 3. Further decides that the working group shall submit a report on its work, 
reflecting discussions held and proposals made, to the General Assembly at its sixty-
eighth session, which will assess its work, taking into account developments in other 
relevant forums; 

 4. Requests the Secretary-General to provide, within available resources, 
the support necessary to convene the aforementioned working group; 

 5. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-eighth session an 
item entitled “Taking forward multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations”.
