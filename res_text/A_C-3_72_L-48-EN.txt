 Expressing grave concern at the recent reports of serious human rights 

violations and abuses in Myanmar, in particular in Rakhine State, as well as in 

Kachin and northern Shan States,  

 Highly alarmed at the outbreak of violence in Rakhine State in August 2017 

that has caused hundreds of thousands of Rohingya civilians to flee towards 

Bangladesh, and which, thus far, has displaced nearly 600,000 Rohingya, with the 

prospect of even higher numbers of displaced people,  

 Further alarmed by the disproportionate and sustained use of force by the 

Myanmar forces against the Rohingya community and others in northern Rakhine 

State, 

 Condemning the attacks of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army against 

police and military posts on 25 August 2017,  

 Underlining the importance of the Government of Myanmar intensifying 

efforts to fulfil its human rights obligations, and concerned about the denial of 

human rights violations by the Government of Myanmar,  

 Underlining also the need for the armed forces of Myanmar to take immediate 

steps to protect all civilians, including those belonging to the Rohingya community, 

by respecting international law, including human rights law, and ending the 

violence, and calling for urgent steps to ensure independent and impartial 

investigations into all human rights violations and abuses,  

 Deeply distressed by the reports of unarmed Rohingya in Rakhine State being 

subjected to the unlawful use of force by non-State actors and the excessive use of 

force by the military and security forces, including extrajudicial killings, rape and 

other forms of sexual violence, arbitrary detention and the unexplained 

disappearance of Rohingya civilians in Rakhine State, and by reports of large -scale 

destruction of homes and systematic evictions in northern Rakhine State, including 

the use of arson and violence, 

 Noting with deep concern that, according to the United Nations Children’s 

Fund, nearly 60 per cent of Rohingya Muslims who have been forced to flee to 

Bangladesh are children,  

 Noting with deep concern also the deteriorating security, human rights and 

humanitarian situation in Rakhine State, and the continued serious violations  and 

abuses of human rights of Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State, as well as  

statelessness, disenfranchisement, economic dispossession, marginalization and 

deprivation of livelihoods, as well as restrictions on freedom of movement for 

persons belonging to the Rohingya community, including the confinement of 

approximately 120,000 people in camps for internally displaced persons, the 

majority of whom rely entirely on foreign aid,  

 Reaffirming the right of all refugees and displaced persons to return home in 

safety and dignity and in a voluntary and sustainable manner,  

 Taking note of the formation, in 2016, of the Advisory Commission on 

Rakhine State, chaired by Kofi Annan, which submitted its final report in August 

2017,
7
 and the commitment of the Government of Myanmar to implementing the 

Commission’s recommendations and addressing the underlying causes of the 

situation in Rakhine State,

People of Rakhine”, August 2017 (available at: http://www.rakhinecommission.org/app/uploads

A/C.3/72/L.48 

 

3/5 17-19255 

 

 Noting the other commitments of the Government of Myanmar to improve the 

situation in Rakhine State for all communities, while underscoring the need for 

expedited implementation, including through commitments to the return of refugees 

and forcibly displaced persons, and the speech by the State Counsellor of 

12 October 2017, in which she set out her vision for resolving the crisis, including 

through the setting up of the Union Enterprise for Humanitarian Assistance, 

Resettlement and Development in Rakhine and of country-wide interfaith meetings,  

 Concerned that, in spite of Rohingya Muslims having lived in Myanmar for 

generations prior to the independence of Myanmar, they were made stateless by  the 

enactment of the 1982 Citizenship Law and were eventually disenfranchised, in 

2015, from the electoral process,  

 Acknowledging that the denial of citizenship status and related rights to 

Rohingya Muslims and others, including voting rights, is a serious human rights 

concern,  

 Noting with concern the findings of the flash report of 3 February 2017 on the 

mission of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 

to Bangladesh, as well as the report of the rapid response mission of the Office of 

the High Commissioner to Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, in September 2017,  

 Welcoming the decision of the Human Rights Council to constitute a fact -

finding mission pursuant to its resolution 34/22,

Rights Council and at the open debate of the Security Council on Myanmar, held on

attack;

independent investigations of those who commit human rights violations and

communities;  

 (i) To ensure that any response against extremism is proportionate and
