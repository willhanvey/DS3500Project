 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 

territorial integrity of Syria, and to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the

killing of over a quarter of a million people, including tens of thousands of child 

casualties, as a result of the Syrian conflict,  

 Gravely distressed by the continued deterioration of the devastating 

humanitarian situation in Syria and by the fact that urgent humanitarian assistance, 

including medical assistance, is now required by more than 13.5 million people in 

Syria — of whom 6.5 million are internally displaced, 4.5 million are living in hard -

to-reach areas, including Palestinian refugees, and 393,700 civilians are trapped in

obligations of all parties under international humanitarian law and international 

human rights law, as well as all the relevant decisions of the Security Council, 

including by ceasing all attacks against civilians and civilian objects, including those 

involving attacks on schools, medical facilities and the deliberate interruptions of

air strikes, indiscriminate shelling by mortars, car bombs, suicide attacks and tunnel 

bombs, as well as the use of starvation of civilians as a method of combat, including 

by the besiegement of populated areas, and the widespread use of torture,

 Expressing its grave concern that areas of Syria are under the control of the 

Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as Daesh), and Al Nusrah Front 

(ANF) and about the negative impact of their presence, violent extremist ideology and 

actions on stability in Syria and the region, including the devastating humanitarian 

impact on the civilian populations which has led to the displacement of hundreds of 

thousands of people, reaffirming its resolve to address all aspects of the threat posed 

by ISIL (also known as Daesh), ANF and all other individuals, groups, undertakings 

and entities associated with Al-Qaida, and other terrorist groups, as determined by the 

United Nations Security Council, and as may further be agreed by the International 

Syria Support Group (ISSG) and endorsed by the UN Security Council, and calling

2015 (S/PRST/2015/11), 

 Expressing grave concern also at the movement of foreign terrorist fighters and 

other terrorists and terrorist groups into and out of Syria and reiterating its call on all 

States to take steps, consistent with international law, to prevent and suppress the flow 

of foreign terrorist fighters to ISIL, ANF and all other individuals, groups, 

undertakings and entities associated with ISIL or Al-Qaida, and other terrorist groups, 

as determined by the United Nations Security Council, and as may further be agreed 

by the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) and endorsed by the UN Security 

Council, 

 Reaffirming the primary responsibility of the Syrian authorities to protect the 

population in Syria and, reiterating that parties to armed conflict must take all feasible 

steps to protect civilians, and recalling in this regard its demand that all parties to 

armed conflict comply fully with the obligations applicable to them under 

international law related to the protection of civilians in armed conflict, including 

journalists, media professionals and associated personnel, 

 Strongly condemning the arbitrary detention and torture of individuals in Syria, 

notably in prisons and detention facilities, as well as the kidnappings, abductions, 

hostage taking and forced disappearances, and demanding the immediate end of these 

practices and the release of all arbitrarily detained persons starting with women and

 Noting that, despite all the challenges, since the adoption of resolution 2165 

(2014), the United Nations and their implementing partners continue to deliver life -

saving assistance to millions of people in need in Syria through humanitarian aid 

delivered across borders, including the delivery of food assistance for over 2.4 million 

people; non-food items for 1.6 million people; medical supplies for 4.1 million 

treatments, and water and sanitation supplies for over 1.3 million people,  

 Deeply disturbed by the decline in the number of people reached with 

humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach and besieged areas, and expressing grave 

alarm at the dire situation of the 393,700 civilians trapped in besieged areas in the 

Syrian Arab Republic, and noting in this regard that in 2015, the United Nations has 

only been able to reach 3.5 per cent of people in besieged areas with health assistance 

and 0.7 per cent of people with food assistance per month,  

 Expressing grave concern at all instances of hindrances to the effective delivery 

of humanitarian assistance, noting that ISIL (also known as Daesh), ANF and all other 

individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, are hindering 

the effective delivery of humanitarian assistance, including to nearly half of the 

people in hard-to-reach areas and over half of the people in besieged areas, and are 

responsible for preventing aid delivery through deliberate interference and 

obstruction,  

 Expressing further grave concern at the continuing and growing impediments to 

the delivery of humanitarian assistance across conflict lines, including through a 

decline in convoy approvals by the Syrian authorities, and noting in this regard that as 

of 31 October, only 27 out of the 91 inter-agency requests made in 2015 by the United 

Nations had been approved in principle by the Syrian authorities, and that between 

2013 and 2015, the percentage of inter-agency convoys approved in principle declined 

from 65 per cent to 29 per cent, 

 Expressing grave concern that access to medical care continues to be severely 

restricted, and reiterating the need to respect the principle of medical neutrality, 

facilitate free passage to all areas for medical personnel, equipment, transport and 

supplies, including surgical items, 

 Reaffirming the need to support the United Nations and their implementing 

partners in their efforts to expand the delivery of humanitarian assistance to reach all 

people in need in Syria, and further reaffirming its decision in resolution 2165 (2014) 

that all Syrian parties to the conflict shall enable the immediate and unhindered 

delivery of humanitarian assistance directly to people throughout Syria, by the United 

Nations and their implementing partners, on the basis of United Nations assessments 

of need and devoid of any political prejudices and aims, including by immediately 

removing all impediments to the provision of humanitarian assistance,  

 Expressing its interest in receiving more detailed information from the 

UN Secretary-General on the delivery of humanitarian assistance by the United 

Nations and their implementing partners, in accordance with UNSC Resolution 2165,  

 Expressing its appreciation for the work of the United Nations monitoring 

mechanism in monitoring shipments and confirming their humanitarian nature, in 

accordance with resolutions 2165 (2014) and 2191 (2014), and commending the 

mechanism’s efforts in facilitating cross-border delivery of humanitarian aid by the 

United Nations and their implementing partners, and encouraging the United Nations 

and their implementing partners to continue to take steps to scale up humanitarian 



S/2015/1001 
 

 

15-22721 4/5 

 

deliveries into hard-to-reach and besieged areas, including by using, as effectively as 

possible, border crossings under resolution 2165 (2014), 

 Recalling the need for all parties to respect the relevant provisions of 

international humanitarian law and the United Nations guiding principles of 

humanitarian emergency assistance, and emphasising the importance of upholding the 

principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence in the provision of 

humanitarian assistance, and recalling also the importance of humanitarian deliveries 

reaching their intended beneficiaries, 

 Noting the role that ceasefire agreements which are consistent with humanitarian 

principles and international humanitarian law can play in facilitating the delivery of 

humanitarian assistance in order to help save civilian lives, and welcoming in this 

regard recent progress on ceasefire agreements in Syria that have benefited the 

humanitarian situation, 

 Expressing grave concern at the more than 4.2 million refugees, including more 

than 3.2 million women and children, who have fled Syria as a result of ongoing 

violence, and recognizing that the continued deterioration of the humanitarian 

situation in Syria is further contributing to the movement of refugees and poses risks 

to regional stability, 

 Reiterating its deep appreciation for the significant and admirable efforts that 

have been made by the countries of the region, notably Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq 

and Egypt, to accommodate Syrian refugees, including the approximately 1.8  million 

refugees who have fled Syria since the adoption of resolution 2139 (2014), and 

mindful of the immense costs and social challenges incurred by these countries as a 

consequence of the crisis, 

 Noting with concern that the international response to the Syrian and regional 

crisis continues to fall short of meeting the needs as assessed by host governments and 

the United Nations, therefore urging once again all Member States, based on burden -

sharing principles, to support the United Nations and the countries of the region, 

including by adopting medium and long-term responses to alleviate the impact on 

communities, providing increased, flexible and predictable funding as well as 

increasing resettlement efforts, and taking note in this regard of the Berlin 

Communiqué of 28 October 2014, and welcoming the announcement of the Syria 

Donors Conference in London, which will be generously hosted by the United 

Kingdom, Germany, Norway, Kuwait and the United Nations in early February 2016,  

 Noting with grave concern that impunity in Syria contributes to widespread 

violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian 

law, stressing the need to end impunity for these violations and abuses, and 

re-emphasizing in this regard the need that those who have committed or are 

otherwise responsible for such violations and abuses in Syria must be brought to 

justice, 

 Emphasizing that the humanitarian situation will continue to deteriorate further 

in the absence of a political solution to the crisis,  

 Determining that the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Syria continues to 

constitute a threat to peace and security in the region, 

 Underscoring that Member States are obligated under Article 25 of the Charter 

of the United Nations to accept and carry out the Council’s decisions,  



 
S/2015/1001 

 

5/5 15-22721 

 

 1. Demands that all parties, in particular the Syrian authorities, immediately 

comply with their obligations under international law, including international 

humanitarian law and international human rights law as applicable, and further 

demands the full and immediate implementation of all the provisions of Security 

Council resolutions 2139 (2014), 2165(2014), and 2191 (2014), and noting the 

Presidential Statements of 2 October 2013 (S/PRST/2013/15), 24 April 2015 

(S/PRST/2015/10) and 17 August 2015 (S/PRST/2015/15) and recalls that some of the

against humanity;

cross-line deliveries submitted by the United Nations and their implementing partners, 

and to give such requests positive consideration;  

 4. Reiterates that the situation will continue to deteriorate further in the 

absence of a political solution to the Syrian conflict and emphasises the need to fully 

implement the Geneva Communiqué of 30 June 2012 endorsed as annex II of its 

resolution 2118 (2013), the Joint Statement on the outcome of the multilateral talks on 

Syria in Vienna of 30 October 2015 and the Statement of the International Syria 

Support Group (ISSG) of 14 November 2015;  

 5. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Council on the 

implementation of this resolution, and on compliance by all relevant parties in Syria, 

within the framework of its reporting on resolutions 2139 (2014), 2165 (2014) and 

2191 (2014), and further requests the Secretary-General to include in his reports 

overall trends in humanitarian access; 

 6. Reaffirms that it will take further measures under the Charter of the United 

Nations in the event of non-compliance with this resolution or resolutions 2139
