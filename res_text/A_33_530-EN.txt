had informed the United Nations early in 1978 that IALA, after further

for its transfer to the United Nations. This -vras agreed to by the Austrian 
authorities and IAEA. In his report, the Secretary-General outlined revised plans 
for space utilization of those parts of the Centre intended for the use of
