  Implementation of the Convention on Cluster Munitions 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 63/71 of 2 December 2008 on the Convention on 

Cluster Munitions and 70/54 of 7 December 2015, 71/45 of 5 December 2016, 72/54 

of 4 December 2017, 73/54 of 5 December 2018, 74/62 of 12 December 2019 and 

75/62 of 7 December 2020 on the implementation of the Convention,  

 Reaffirming its determination to put an end for all time to the suffering and 

casualties caused by cluster munitions at the time of their use, when they fail to 

function as intended or when they are abandoned,  

 Deploring the recent cases of cluster munitions use and related civilian 

casualties, and calling upon those who continue to use cluster munitions to cease any 

such activity immediately, 

 Conscious that cluster munition remnants kill or maim civilians, including 

women and children, obstruct economic and social development, including through 

the loss of livelihood, impede post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction, delay or 

prevent the return of refugees and internally displaced persons, can have a negative 

impact on national and international peacebuilding and humanitarian assistance 

efforts, and have other severe consequences for many years after use,  

 Concerned about the dangers presented by the large national stockpiles of 

cluster munitions retained for operational use, and determined to ensure their rapid 

destruction, 

 Recognizing the impact of cluster munitions on women, men, girls and boys and 

the importance of relevant States providing adequate, gender- and age-sensitive 

assistance to victims of cluster munitions,

 Believing it necessary to contribute effectively in an efficient, coordinated 

manner to resolving the challenge of removing cluster munition remnants located 

throughout the world, and to ensure their destruction,  

 Mindful of the need to adequately coordinate efforts undertaken in various 

forums, including through the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 1 

to address the rights and needs of victims of various types of weapons, and resolved 

to avoid discrimination among victims of various types of weapons,  

 Reaffirming that in cases not covered by the Convention on Cluster Munitions2 

or by other international agreements, civilians and combatants remain under the 

protection and authority of the principles of international law, derived from 

established custom, from the principles of humanity and from the dictate s of public 

conscience, 

 Welcoming the steps taken nationally, regionally and globally in recent years 

aimed at prohibiting, restricting or suspending the use, stockpiling, production and 

transfer of cluster munitions, and welcoming also in this regard tha t, since 2014, all 

Central American States have joined the Convention, thus fulfilling their aspiration 

to become the first cluster munitions-free region in the world, 

 Stressing the role of public conscience in furthering the principles of humanity, 

as evidenced by the global call for an end to civilian suffering caused by cluster 

munitions, and recognizing the efforts to that end undertaken by the United Nations, 

the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Cluster Munition Coalition and 

numerous other non-governmental organizations around the world,  

 Noting that a total of 123 States have joined the Convention, 110 as States 

parties and 13 as signatories, 

 Emphasizing the need to make further efforts in accelerating the universalization 

process, 

 Noting the outcome of the second Review Conference of States Parties to the 

Convention on Cluster Munitions, held in Geneva from 25 to 27 November 2020 and 

on 20 and 21 September 2021, and in particular the adoption of the Lausanne 

Declaration entitled “Protecting lives, empowering victims, enabling development” 

and the Lausanne Action Plan 2021–2026 to support the full and effective 

implementation of the Convention,  

 Recognizing the importance of full involvement and equal opportunities for the 

meaningful participation of women and men in disarmament processes, policy and 

programming decisions related to the Convention,  

 1. Urges all States not parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions to 

ratify or accede to it as soon as possible, and all States parties that are in a position to

 2. Stresses the importance of the full and effective implementation of and 

compliance with the Convention, including through the implementation of the 

Lausanne Action Plan, as appropriate;

documented evidence of the use of cluster munitions in different parts of the world, 

related civilian casualties and other consequences that impede the achievement of 

sustainable development;
