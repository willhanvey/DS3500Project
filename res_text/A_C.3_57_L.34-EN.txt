envisaged in this resolution for the effective implementation of the Durban
Declaration and Programme of Action,

Welcoming also the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of
the programme of action for the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial
Discrimination and follow-up to the World Conference against Racism, Racial
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance,4

Welcoming further the report on contemporary forms of racism, racial
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance prepared by the former Special
Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights,5

Reaffirming its firm determination and its commitment to eradicate totally and
unconditionally racism and racial discrimination, and its conviction that racism and
racial discrimination, in all their forms and manifestations, constitute a total
negation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights,6

Reaffirming also its commitment to a global drive for the total elimination of
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,

Stressing the need to maintain continued political will and momentum at the
national, regional and international levels in order to combat racism, racial
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, taking into account
commitments undertaken under the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action,
and recalling the importance of enhancing national action and international
cooperation to this end,

Recognizing that the successful implementation of the Durban Declaration and
Programme of Action requires political will and commitment, adequate funding at
the national, regional and international levels, and international cooperation,

Deeply concerned that, despite continued efforts, racism, racial discrimination,
xenophobia and related intolerance and acts of violence persist and even grow in
magnitude, incessantly adopting new forms, including tendencies to establish
policies based on racial, religious, ethnic, cultural and national superiority or
exclusivity,

Particularly alarmed at the increase in racist violence and xenophobic ideas in
many parts of the world, in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in
society at large, as a result of the resurgent activities of associations established on
the basis of racist and xenophobic platforms and charters, and the persistent use of
those platforms and charters to promote or incite racist ideologies,

Reaffirming general recommendation XV (42) of 17 March 1993 of the
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination7 concerning article 4 of the
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,8
which holds that the prohibition of the dissemination of ideas based on racial
superiority or racial hatred is compatible with the right to freedom of opinion and

expression as outlined in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
and in article 5 of the Convention,

Reaffirming also that universal adherence to and full implementation of the
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination
are of paramount importance for promoting equality and non-discrimination in the
world,

Underlining the importance of urgently eliminating continued and violent
trends of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and
conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic
attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy, tends to
encourage the recurrence of such crimes and requires resolute action and
cooperation for its eradication,

Recognizing that Governments should implement and enforce appropriate and
effective legislation to prevent acts of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and
related intolerance, thereby contributing to the prevention of human rights
violations,

Emphasizing that poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion
and economic disparities are closely associated with racism, racial discrimination,
xenophobia and related intolerance and contribute to the persistence of racist
attitudes and practices which in turn generate more poverty,

Recalling the adoption by the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session of the
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and
Members of Their Families,9

Acknowledging that slavery and the slave trade, including the transatlantic
slave trade, are among the major sources and manifestations of racism, racial
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and recognizing that colonialism
has led to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,

Acknowledging also that lessons learned from history are vital in averting
future tragedies, and taking into account the duty to remember and to promote
dialogue and understanding among peoples and cultures,

Welcoming United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
resolution 31C/28 of 2 November 2001, entitled “Proclamation of 2004 as
International Year to Commemorate the Struggle against Slavery and its
