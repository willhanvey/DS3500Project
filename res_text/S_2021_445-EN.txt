  United States of America: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming all previous resolutions and Presidential statements concerning the 

situation in Abyei and along the border between Sudan and South Sudan and 

underlining the importance of full compliance with and implementation of these,  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 

territorial integrity of Sudan and South Sudan,  

 Welcoming continued cooperation between the Government of the Republic of 

the Sudan and the Government of the Republic of South Sudan in support of peace, 

security and stability, encouraging such actions to continue, and urging the parties to 

make progress establishing temporary administrative and security arrangements for 

Abyei, and to continue to support development and humanitarian assistance efforts,  

 Encouraging the African Union, the African Union High-Level Implementation 

Panel (AUHIP), and the UN Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Horn of 

Africa to intensify their mediation roles with the Governments of South Sudan and 

Sudan to strongly encourage them to establish temporary administrative and security 

arrangements for Abyei as stipulated in the 2011 Agreement between the Government 

of the Republic of Sudan and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement on Temporary 

Arrangements for the Administration and Security of the Abyei area and to engage on 

finding a resolution of the final status of Abyei,  

 Commending the continued assistance provided to the parties by the Federal 

Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, and the United Nations Interim Security Force f or 

Abyei (UNISFA), 

 Recognizing the need to keep under review the configuration of UNISFA to 

adapt to the current security situation and to develop a viable exit strategy, which 

prioritizes safety and security of civilians living in Abyei and accounts for the stability 

of the region, and is based on the improved ability of Sudan and South Sudan to 

manage bilateral disputes, 

 Expressing concern that the delayed deployment of UN police to the level 

authorized by the Council prevents UNISFA from fulfilling its  security and protection 

mandate and holds the potential to create a security vacuum in Abyei, and further 

expressing concern about Sudan and South Sudan’s efforts to impede UNISFA from 

fully executing its mandate, including by withholding visas for police , blocking 

appointment of a civilian Deputy Head of Mission and denying access to Athony 

airport, which would ease UNISFA’s logistical challenges, reduce transport costs, and 

enhance safety and security for UNISFA personnel,
