Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied 

by Israel since 1967, 

 Recalling, in this regard, the International Covenant on Civil and Political

affirming that these human rights instruments must be respected in the Occupied 

Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, as well as in the occupied Syrian

 Recalling further its resolution 67/19 of 29 November 2012, 

 Taking note of the accession by Palestine to several human rights treaties and 

the core humanitarian law treaties, as well as to other international treaties,  

 Expressing its concern about the exploitation by Israel, the occupying Power, of 

the natural resources of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 

and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967,  

 Expressing its grave concern about the extensive destruction by Israel, the 

occupying Power, of agricultural land and orchards in the Occupied Palestinian 

Territory, including the uprooting of a vast number of fruit-bearing trees and the 

destruction of farms and greenhouses, and the grave environmental and economic 

impact in this regard, 

 Expressing its grave concern also about the widespread destruction caused by 

Israel, the occupying Power, to vital infrastructure, including water pipelines, sewage 

networks and electricity networks, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in particular 

in the Gaza Strip during the military operations of July and August 2014, which, 

inter alia, has polluted the environment and which negatively affects the functioning

 Deploring the detrimental impact of the Israeli settlements on Palestinian and 

other Arab natural resources, especially as a result of the confiscation of land and the 

forced diversion of water resources, including the destruction of orchards and crops 

and the seizure of water wells by Israeli settlers, and of the dire socioeconomic 

consequences in this regard, 

 Recalling the report of the independent international fact-finding mission to 

investigate the implications of the Israeli settlements on the civil, political, economic, 

social and cultural rights of the Palestinian people throughout the Occupied 

Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem,5  

 Aware of the detrimental impact on Palestinian natural resources being caused 

by the unlawful construction of the wall by Israel, the occupying Power, in the 

Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and of its 

grave effect as well on the economic and social conditions of the Palestinian people,  

 Stressing the urgency of achieving without delay an end to the Israeli occupation 

that began in 1967 and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace settlement on all 

tracks, on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) of 

22 October 1973, 425 (1978) of 19 March 1978, 1397 (2002) of 12 March 2002 and 

2334 (2016), the principle of land for peace, the Arab Peace Initiative6 and the Quartet 

performance-based road map to a permanent two-State solution to the Israeli-

Palestinian conflict, 7  as endorsed by the Council in its resolution 1515 (2003) of 

19 November 2003 and supported by the Council in its resolution 1850 (2008) of 

16 December 2008, 

 Stressing also, in this regard, the need for respect for the obligation upon Israel 

under the road map to freeze settlement activity, including so-called “natural growth”, 

and to dismantle all settlement outposts erected since March 2001,  

 Stressing further the need for respect and preservation of the territorial unity, 

contiguity and integrity of all of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 

Jerusalem, 

 Recalling that the Security Council, in its resolution 2334 (2016), underlined 

that it would not recognize any changes to the 4 June 1967 lines, including with regard 

to Jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties through negotiations,  

 Recalling also the need to end all acts of violence, including acts of terror,  

provocation, incitement and destruction,  

 Taking note of the report prepared by the Economic and Social Commission for 

Western Asia on the economic and social repercussions of the Israeli occupation on 

the living conditions of the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 

including East Jerusalem, and of the Arab population in the occupied Syrian Golan, 

as transmitted by the Secretary-General,8

population of the occupied Syrian Golan over their natural resources, including land, 

water and energy resources; 

 2. Demands that Israel, the occupying Power, cease the exploitation, damage, 

cause of loss or depletion and endangerment of the natural resources in the Occupied 

Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan;

result of any exploitation, damage, loss or depletion or endangerment of their natural 

resources resulting from illegal measures taken by Israel, the occupying Power, and 

Israeli settlers in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and 

expresses the hope that this issue will be dealt with within the framework of the final 

status negotiations between the Palestinian and Israeli sides;  

 4. Stresses that the wall and settlements being constructed by Israel in the 

Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, are contrary 

to international law and are seriously depriving the Palestinian people of their natural 

resources, and calls in this regard for full compliance with the legal obligations

and in relevant United Nations resolutions, including General Assembly resolution 

ES-10/15;

Jerusalem; 

 6. Also calls upon Israel, the occupying Power, to bring a halt to all  actions, 

including those perpetrated by Israeli settlers, harming the environment, including the 

dumping of all kinds of waste materials, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 

including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan, which gravely threaten 

their natural resources, namely water and land resources, and which pose an 

environmental, sanitation and health threat to the civilian populations;  

 7. Further calls upon Israel to cease its destruction of vital infrastructure, 

including water pipelines, sewage networks and electricity networks, and to cease its 

demolition and confiscation of Palestinian homes and civilian infrastructure, 

agricultural lands and water wells, which, inter alia, have a negative impact on the 

natural resources of the Palestinian people, stresses the urgent need to advance 

reconstruction and development projects in this regard, including in the Gaza Strip, 

and calls for support for the necessary efforts in this regard, in line with the 

commitments made at, inter alia, the Cairo International Conference on Palestine: 

Reconstructing Gaza, held on 12 October 2014;  

 8. Calls upon Israel, the occupying Power, to remove all obstacles to the

 9. Also calls upon Israel not to impede Palestinian development and export 

of discovered oil and natural gas reserves; 

 10. Calls for the immediate and safe removal of all unexploded ordnance in 

the Gaza Strip and for support for the efforts of the Mine Action Service of the United 

Nations in this regard, and welcomes the extensive efforts exerted by the Mine Action 

Service to date; 

 11. Encourages all States and international organizations to continue to 

actively pursue policies to ensure respect for their obligations under international law 

with regard to all illegal Israeli practices and measures in the Occup ied Palestinian

exploitation of natural resources;

A/C.2/75/L.35 

 

5/5 20-13965

between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967;  

 13. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its 

seventy-sixth session on the implementation of the present resolution, including with 

regard to the cumulative impact of the exploitation, damage and depletion by Israel 

of natural resources in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 

and in the occupied Syrian Golan, and with regard to the impact of such practices on 

the promotion of the Sustainable Development Goals,9 and decides to include in the
