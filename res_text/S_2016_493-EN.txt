 Expressing grave alarm and concern regarding the conflict between the

violence aimed at spreading terror among the civilian population, and attacks on 

schools, places of worship and hospitals, as well as United Nations and associated 

peacekeeping personnel and objects, by all parties, including armed groups and 

national security forces, as well as the incitement to commit such abuses and 

violations, further condemning harassment and targeting of civil society, 

humanitarian personnel and journalists, and emphasizing that those responsible for 

violations of international humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human 

rights must be held accountable, and that South Sudan’s TGNU bears the primary 

responsibility to protect its population from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, 

and crimes against humanity,  

 Expressing deep concern over the large-scale displacement of persons and 

deepening humanitarian crisis, noting the finding in the final report of the South 

Sudan Panel of Experts (S/2016/70), established pursuant to paragraph 18 of 

resolution 2206 (2015), that obstruction of humanitarian access is widespread and 

that parts of numerous states of South Sudan are entirely blocked from humanitarian 

relief, stressing the responsibility borne by all parties to the conflict for the 

suffering of the people of South Sudan, and in this regard, recognizes that in 

accordance with the Agreement, the TGNU shall review the Non -Governmental 

Organizations Bill, and submit the legislation to a process of public consultation to 

ensure that such legislation is consistent with international best practice and with its 

commitment to create an enabling political, administrative, operational and legal

efforts to provide urgent and coordinated support to the population, calling upon all

humanitarian catastrophe, widespread human rights violations and abuses, and 

government violations of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) 

status-of-forces agreement, and noting the finding in the Panel of Experts Final 

Report that, while it is not a violation of the sanctions measures established 

pursuant to resolution 2206 (2015), both sides have continued to acquire arms and 

military equipment after the signing of the Agreement and noting that such 

acquisitions undermine the implementation of the Agreement by facilitating 

violations of the permanent ceasefire,  

 Welcoming the resolve indicated in the IGAD Council of Ministers Communiqué 

of 31 January 2016, urging the TGNU to abide by and take no action inconsistent

PSC Communiqué dated 26 September 2015 expressing determination to impose 

measures against all those who would impede the implementation o f the Agreement

16-08715 4/8 

 

 Taking note with interest of the reports on the human rights situation in South 

Sudan issued by UNMISS, the Secretary-General, and the Office of the High 

Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR),  

 Expressing grave concern that, according to the 11 March 2016 “Report of 

Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights Assessment Mission to Improve 

Human Rights, Accountability, Reconciliations and Capacity in South Sudan” and 

the UNMISS/OHCHR 4 December 2015 report “The State of Human Rights in the 

Protracted Conflict in South Sudan”, the scale, intensity and severity of human 

rights violations and abuses have increased with the cont inuation of hostilities, that 

there continue to be reasonable grounds to believe that violations and abuses of 

human rights, including those involving extrajudicial killings, rape and other acts of 

sexual and gender-based violence, enforced disappearances, and arbitrary detention, 

as well as violations of international humanitarian law have been committed, which 

may amount to war crimes and/or crimes against humanity, and stressing the urgent 

and imperative need to end impunity in South Sudan and to bring to justice 

perpetrators of such crimes,  

 Welcoming the release of the AU Commission of Inquiry (AU COI) report on 

South Sudan and the Separate Opinion, and recognizing the AU COI’s work in 

investigating and documenting violations and abuses of internationa l human rights 

law and violations of international humanitarian law in South Sudan and expressing 

grave concern at the AU COI’s finding that it has reasonable grounds to believe that 

war crimes such as murder, outrages upon personal dignity such as rape and other 

acts of sexual violence, and cruel and degrading treatment, targeting of civilian 

objects and protected property have occurred and that violations were carried out by 

both sides to the conflict,  

 Emphasizing its hope that this and other reporting will be considered, as 

appropriate, by the mechanisms on transitional justice, accountability, reconciliation 

and healing as called for in Chapter V of the Agreement, including the hybrid court 

and the Commission for Truth, Healing, and Reconciliation, stressing the 

importance of accountability, reconciliation, and healing among all South Sudanese 

communities as prominent elements of a transitional agenda, while also taking note 

of the important role international investigations, and where appropriate, 

prosecutions can play with respect to holding those responsible for war crimes and 

crimes against humanity,  

 Strongly condemning the use of media to broadcast hate speech and transmit 

messages instigating sexual violence against a particular ethnic group, which has the 

potential to play a significant role in promoting mass violence and exacerbating 

conflict, and calling on the TGNU to take appropriate measures to address such 

activity, and further urging all parties to desist from these actions and instead 

contribute to promoting peace and reconciliation among the communities,  

 Recognizing the important role played by civil society organizations, faith 

leaders, women, and youth in South Sudan, underscoring the importance of their 

participation — along with the former SPLM detainees and other political parties — 

to finding a sustainable solution to the crisis in the country, and concerned by efforts 

of some TGNU officials to limit such participation including by increased 

restrictions of freedom of expression,

the illicit circulation of such weapons,  

 Recalling the Informal Working Group on General issues of Sanctions report 

(S/2006/997) on best practices and methods, including paragraphs 21, 22, 23, 24
