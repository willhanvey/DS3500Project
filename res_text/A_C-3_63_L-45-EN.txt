  Equitable geographical distribution in the membership of the 
human rights treaty bodies 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions in this regard,  

 Reaffirming the importance of the goal of universal ratification of the United 
Nations human rights instruments, 

 Welcoming the significant increase in the number of ratifications of United 
Nations human rights instruments, which has especially contributed to their 
universality, 

 Reiterating the importance of the effective functioning of treaty bodies 
established pursuant to United Nations human rights instruments for the full and 
effective implementation of those instruments, 

 Recalling that, with regard to the election of the members of the human rights 
treaty bodies, the General Assembly as well as the Commission on Human Rights 
recognized the importance of giving consideration in their membership to equitable 
geographical distribution, gender balance and representation of the principal legal 
systems and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and shall serve in 
their personal capacity, and shall be of high moral character, acknowledged 
impartiality and recognized competence in the field of human rights, 



A/C.3/63/L.45  
 

08-58102 2 
 

 Reaffirming the significance of national and regional particularities and 
various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds, as well as of different 
political, economic and legal systems, 

 Recognizing that the United Nations pursues multilingualism as a means of 
promoting, protecting and preserving diversity of languages and cultures globally 
and that genuine multilingualism promotes unity in diversity and international 
understanding, 

 Recalling that the General Assembly as well as the Commission on Human 
Rights encouraged States parties to United Nations human rights treaties, 
individually and through meetings of States parties, to consider how to give better 
effect, inter alia, to the principle of equitable geographical distribution in the 
membership of treaty bodies, 

 Expressing concern at the regional imbalance in the current composition of the 
membership of some of the human rights treaty bodies, 

 Noting in particular that the status quo tends to be particularly detrimental to 
the election of experts from some regional groups, 

 Convinced that the goal of equitable geographical distribution in the 
membership of human rights treaty bodies is perfectly compatible and can be fully 
realized and achieved in harmony with the need to ensure gender balance and the 
representation of the principal legal systems in those bodies and the high moral 
character, acknowledged impartiality and recognized competence in the field of 
human rights of their members, 

 1. Encourages the States parties to the United Nations human rights 
instruments to consider and adopt concrete actions, inter alia, the possible 
establishment of quota distribution systems by geographical region for the election 
of the members of the treaty bodies, thereby ensuring the paramount objective of 
equitable geographical distribution in the membership of those human rights bodies; 

 2. Calls upon the States parties to the United Nations human rights 
instruments to include a debate on ways and means to ensure equitable geographical 
distribution in the membership of the human rights treaty bodies, based on previous 
recommendations of the Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and 
Social Council and the provisions of the present resolution; 

 3. Recommends, when considering the possible establishment of a quota by 
region for the election of the membership of each treaty body, the introduction of 
flexible procedures that encompass the following criteria: 

 (a) Each of the five regional groups established by the General Assembly 
must be assigned a quota of the membership of each treaty body in equivalent 
proportion to the number of States parties to the instrument that it represents; 

 (b) There must be provision for periodic revisions that reflect the relative 
changes in the geographical distribution of States parties; 

 (c) Automatic periodic revisions should be envisaged in order to avoid 
amending the text of the instrument when the quotas are revised; 

 4. Stresses that the process needed to achieve the goal of equitable 
geographical distribution in the membership of human rights treaty bodies can 



 A/C.3/63/L.45
 

3 08-58102 
 

contribute to raising awareness of the importance of gender balance, the 
representation of the principal legal systems and the principle that the members of 
the treaty bodies shall be elected and shall serve in their personal capacity, and shall 
be of high moral character, acknowledged impartiality and recognized competence 
in the field of human rights; 

 5. Requests the chairpersons of the human rights treaty bodies to consider at 
their next meeting the content of the present resolution and to submit, through the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, specific recommendations 
for the achievement of the goal of equitable geographical distribution in the 
membership of the human rights treaty bodies; 

 6. Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
submit concrete recommendations on the implementation of the present resolution to 
the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session; 

 7. Decides to continue its consideration of this question at its sixty-fourth 
session under the item entitled “Promotion and protection of human rights”.
