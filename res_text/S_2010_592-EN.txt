 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions concerning the situation in Somalia, 
especially resolutions 1814 (2008), 1816 (2008), 1838 (2008), 1844 (2008), 1846 
(2008), 1851 (2008), 1897 (2009), and 1918 (2010), as well as the Statement of its 
President (S/PRST/2010/16) of 25 August 2010,  

 Continuing to be gravely concerned by the ongoing threat that piracy and 
armed robbery at sea against vessels pose to the prompt, safe, and effective delivery 
of humanitarian aid to Somalia and the region, to the safety of seafarers and other 
persons, to international navigation and the safety of commercial maritime routes, 
and to other vulnerable ships, including fishing activities in conformity with 
international law, and also gravely concerned by the extended range of the piracy 
threat into the western Indian Ocean and the increase in pirate capacities,  

 Expressing concern about the reported involvement of children in piracy off 
the coast of Somalia,  

 Recognizing that the ongoing instability in Somalia contributes to the problem 
of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, and stressing the need 
for a comprehensive response to tackle piracy and its underlying causes by the 
international community, 

 Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political 
independence and unity of Somalia, including Somalia’s rights with respect to 
offshore natural resources, including fisheries, in accordance with international law, 
and stressing the importance of preventing, in accordance with international law, 
illegal fishing and illegal dumping, including toxic substances,  

 Further reaffirming that international law, as reflected in the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (“The Convention”), sets 
out the legal framework applicable to combating piracy and armed robbery at sea, as 
well as other ocean activities,  

 Again taking into account the crisis situation in Somalia, and the limited 
capacity of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) to interdict, or upon 



S/2010/592  
 

10-64896 2 
 

interdiction to prosecute pirates or to patrol or secure the waters off the coast of 
Somalia, including the international sea lanes and Somalia’s territorial waters,  

 Noting the several requests from the TFG for international assistance to 
counter piracy off its coast, including the letter of 20 October 2010 from the 
Permanent Representative of Somalia to the United Nations expressing the 
appreciation of the TFG to the Security Council for its assistance, expressing the 
TFG’s willingness to consider working with other States and regional organizations 
to combat piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, and requesting 
that the provisions of resolution 1897 (2009) be renewed for an additional twelve 
months,  

 Commending the efforts of the EU operation Atalanta, North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization operations Allied Protector and Ocean Shield, Combined Maritime 
Forces’ Combined Task Force 151, and other States acting in a national capacity in 
cooperation with the TFG and each other, to suppress piracy and to protect 
vulnerable ships transiting through the waters off the coast of Somalia, and 
welcoming the efforts of individual countries, including China, India, Islamic 
Republic of Iran, Japan, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Saudi 
Arabia, and Yemen, which have deployed ships and/or aircraft in the region, as 
stated in the Secretary-General’s report (S/2010/394),  

 Welcoming the capacity building efforts made by the International Maritime 
Organization (IMO) Djibouti Code Trust Fund (Multi-donor trust fund — Japan 
initiated), and the Trust Fund Supporting Initiatives of States Countering Piracy off 
the Coast of Somalia, and recognizing the need for all engaged international and 
regional organizations to cooperate fully,  

 Noting with concern that the continuing limited capacity and domestic 
legislation to facilitate the custody and prosecution of suspected pirates after their 
capture has hindered more robust international action against the pirates off the 
coast of Somalia, and in some cases has led to pirates being released without facing 
justice, regardless of whether there is sufficient evidence to support prosecution, and 
reiterating that, consistent with the provisions of the Convention concerning the 
repression of piracy, the 1988 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts 
Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (“SUA Convention”) provides for parties 
to create criminal offences, establish jurisdiction, and accept delivery of persons 
responsible for or suspected of seizing or exercising control over a ship by force or 
threat thereof or any other form of intimidation,  

 Underlining the importance of continuing to enhance the collection, 
preservation and transmission to competent authorities of evidence of acts of piracy 
and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, and welcoming the ongoing work 
of IMO, INTERPOL and industry groups to develop guidance to seafarers on 
preservation of crime scenes following acts of piracy, and noting the importance for 
the successful prosecution of acts of piracy of enabling seafarers to give evidence in 
criminal proceedings,  

 Commending the Republic of Kenya and the Republic of Seychelles’ efforts to 
prosecute suspected pirates in their national courts, welcoming the engagement of 
the Republic of Mauritius, and noting with appreciation the assistance being 
provided by the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the Trust 
Fund Supporting Initiatives of States Countering Piracy off the Coast of Somalia, 



 S/2010/592

and other international organizations and donors, in coordination with the Contact 
Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (“CGPCS”), to support Kenya, 
Seychelles, Somalia, and other States in the region, including Yemen, to take steps 
to prosecute, or incarcerate in a third state after prosecution elsewhere, captured 
pirates consistent with applicable international human rights law, and emphasizing 
the need for States and international organizations to further enhance international 
efforts in this regard,  

 Welcoming the readiness of the national and regional administrations of 
Somalia to cooperate with each other and with States who have prosecuted 
suspected pirates with a view to enabling convicted pirates to be repatriated back to 
Somalia under suitable prisoner transfer arrangements, consistent with applicable 
international law including international human rights law,  

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary General (S/2010/394), as requested by 
resolution 1918 (2010), and the ongoing efforts within the CGPCS and the United 
Nations Secretariat to explore possible additional mechanisms to effectively 
prosecute persons suspected of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of 
Somalia,  

 Stressing the need for States to consider possible methods to assist the 
seafarers who are victims of pirates, and welcoming in this regard the ongoing work 
within the CGPCS and the International Maritime Organization on developing 
guidelines for the care of seafarers and other persons who have been subjected to 
acts of piracy,  

 Further noting with appreciation the ongoing efforts by UNODC and UNDP to 
support efforts to enhance the capacity of the corrections system in Somalia, 
including regional authorities notably with the support of the Trust Fund Supporting 
Initiatives of States Countering Piracy off the Coast of Somalia, to incarcerate 
convicted pirates consistent with applicable international human rights law,  

 Bearing in mind the Djibouti Code of Conduct concerning the Repression of 
Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in the Western Indian Ocean and the Gulf 
of Aden, and recognizing the efforts of signatory States to develop the appropriate 
regulatory and legislative frameworks to combat piracy, enhance their capacity to 
patrol the waters of the region, interdict suspect vessels, and prosecute suspected 
pirates,  

 Emphasizing that peace and stability within Somalia, the strengthening of State 
institutions, economic and social development and respect for human rights and the 
rule of law are necessary to create the conditions for a durable eradication of piracy 
and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, and further emphasizing that 
Somalia’s long-term security rests with the effective development by the TFG of the 
National Security Force and Somali Police Force, in the framework of the Djibouti 
Agreement and in line with a national security strategy, 

 Determining that the incidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast 
of Somalia exacerbate the situation in Somalia, which continues to constitute a 
threat to international peace and security in the region,  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 1. Reiterates that it condemns and deplores all acts of piracy and armed

international community; 

 3. Notes again its concern regarding the findings contained in the 
20 November 2008 report of the Monitoring Group on Somalia (S/2008/769, page 
55) that escalating ransom payments and the lack of enforcement of the arms 
embargo established by resolution 733 (1992) are fuelling the growth of piracy off 
the coast of Somalia, and calls upon all States to fully cooperate with the Somalia 
and Eritrea Monitoring Group including on information sharing regarding possible 
arms embargo violations;  

 4. Renews its call upon States and regional organizations that have the 
capacity to do so, to take part in the fight against piracy and armed robbery at sea 
off the coast of Somalia, in particular, consistent with this resolution and 
international law, by deploying naval vessels, arms and military aircraft and through 
seizures and disposition of boats, vessels, arms and other related equipment used in 
the commission of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, or for 
which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting such use;  

 5. Commends the work of the CGPCS to facilitate coordination in order to 
deter acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, in 
cooperation with the IMO, flag States, and the TFG and urges States and

organizations cooperating with the TFG in the fight against piracy and armed 
robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, for which advance notification has been 
provided by the TFG to the Secretary-General;  

 8. Affirms that the authorizations renewed in this resolution apply only with 
respect to the situation in Somalia and shall not affect the rights or obligations or 
responsibilities of Member States under international law, including any rights or 
obligations, under the Convention, with respect to any other situation, and 
underscores in particular that this resolution shall not be considered as establishing 
customary international law; and affirms further that such authorizations have been 



 S/2010/592
 

5 10-64896 
 

renewed only following the receipt of the 20 October 2010 letter conveying the

Member States and regional organizations undertaking measures in accordance with 
paragraph 7 above or to supplies of technical assistance to Somalia solely for the 
purposes set out in paragraph 6 above which have been exempted from those 
measures in accordance with the procedure set out in paragraphs 11 (b) and 12 of 
resolution 1772 (2007);  

 10. Requests that cooperating States take appropriate steps to ensure that the 
activities they undertake pursuant to the authorizations in paragraph 7 do not have 
the practical effect of denying or impairing the right of innocent passage to the ships 
of any third State;

into account further new information and observations from the Secretary-General 
based on the consultations being conducted by his Special Adviser on Legal Issues
