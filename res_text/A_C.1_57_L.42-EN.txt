Recognizing that the enhancement of international peace and security and the
promotion of nuclear disarmament mutually complement and strengthen each other,

Reaffirming the crucial importance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as the cornerstone of the international regime for nuclear
non-proliferation and as an essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear
disarmament, and welcoming the decision of the Republic of Cuba to accede to the
Treaty,

Recognizing the progress made by the nuclear-weapon States on reduction of
their nuclear weapons unilaterally or through their negotiations, including the
completion of the reductions of strategic offensive weapons according to the
START I Treaty and the recent signing of the Treaty on Strategic Offensive
Reductions between the Russian Federation and the United States of America, which
should serve as a step for further nuclear disarmament and the efforts for nuclear
disarmament and non-proliferation by the international community,

Also reaffirming the conviction that further advancement in nuclear
disarmament will contribute to consolidating the international regime for nuclear
non-proliferation, ensuring international peace and security,

Welcoming the continuation of a moratorium on nuclear-weapon-test
explosions or any other nuclear explosions since the recent nuclear tests,

Conference to be held in 2005,

Also welcoming the successful convening of a series of seminars aiming at
further reinforcement of IAEA safeguards, held in Latin America, Central Asia,
Africa and the Asia-Pacific region, and sharing the hope that the conference to be
held in Tokyo in December this year will further strengthen the IAEA safeguards
system, including universalization of its safeguards agreements and their additional
protocols, through making utmost use of the outcomes from the aforementioned
seminars,

Encouraging the Russian Federation and the United States of America to
continue their intensive consultations in accordance with the Joint Declaration on
the New Strategic Relationship between the two States,

for future generations, and noting with satisfaction the submission of the report of
the group of governmental experts on this issue by the Secretary-General to the
General Assembly,

systematic and progressive efforts to implement article VI of the NPT and
paragraphs 3 and 4 (c) of the 1995 decision on principles and objectives for nuclear
non-proliferation and disarmament:

(a) The importance and urgency of signatures and ratifications, without delay
and without conditions and in accordance with constitutional processes, to achieve
the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as well as a
moratorium on nuclear-weapon-test explosions or any other nuclear explosions
pending the entry into force of that Treaty;

(b) The establishment of an ad hoc committee in the Conference on
Disarmament as early as possible during its 2003 session to negotiate a non-
discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty
banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear
explosive devices, in accordance with the statement of the Special Coordinator in



3

A/C.1/57/L.42

1995 and the mandate contained therein, taking into consideration both nuclear
disarmament and non-proliferation objectives, with a view to the conclusion within
five years and, pending its entry into force, a moratorium on the production of fissile
material for nuclear weapons;

(c) The establishment of an appropriate subsidiary body with a mandate to
deal with nuclear disarmament in the Conference on Disarmament as early as
possible during its 2003 session in the context of establishing a programme of work;

disarmament, nuclear and other related arms control and reduction measures;

nuclear weapons capabilities and the implementation of agreements pursuant
to article VI of the NPT and as voluntary confidence-building measures to
support further progress on nuclear disarmament;

unilateral initiatives and as an integral part of the nuclear arms reduction and
disarmament process;

(iv) Concrete agreed measures to further reduce the operational status of

notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile
materials and calls for arrangements by all the nuclear-weapon States to place, as
soon as practicable, fissile material designated by each of them as no longer
required for military purposes under IAEA or other relevant international
verification and arrangements for the disposition of such material for peaceful
purposes to ensure that such material remains permanently outside of military
programmes;

capabilities, including IAEA safeguards, that will be required to provide assurance
of compliance with nuclear disarmament agreements for the achievement and
maintenance of a nuclear-weapon-free world;

9. Calls upon all States to redouble their efforts to prevent and curb the
proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, confirming and

destruction in order, inter alia, to prevent those materials from falling into the hands
of terrorists;

GC(46)/RES/12, which recommends that the Director General, the Board of
Governors and member States of the IAEA continue to consider implementing the
elements of the plan of action outlined in resolution GC(44)/RES/19, adopted at the
