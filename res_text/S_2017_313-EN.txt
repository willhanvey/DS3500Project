 Recalling its resolutions 1645 (2005) and 2282 (2016) and reaffirming the 

primary responsibility of the national Government in implementing its 

peacebuilding and sustaining peace strategies to address the interconnected nature 

of challenges in Haiti, highlighting the contribution of sustainable development to 

peacebuilding and sustaining peace, and in this regard, emphasizing the importance 

of national ownership, inclusivity, and the role that civil society can play to advance 

national peacebuilding processes and objectives in order to ensure that the needs of 

all segments of society are taken into account,  

 Acknowledging that while important progress has been made, Haiti continues 

to face significant humanitarian challenges, especially in the aftermath of Hurricane 

Matthew, and affirming that progress in the reconstruction of Haiti, as well as in 

Haiti’s social and economic development, including women and youth, through 

effective, coordinated, commendable international development assistance and 

increased Haitian institutional capacity to benefit from this assistance, is crucial to 

achieving lasting and sustainable stability, and reiterating the need for security to be 

accompanied by sustainable development in its social, economic and environmental 

dimensions, including efforts in risk reduction and preparedness that address the 

country’s extreme vulnerability to natural disasters, efforts in which the Government 

of Haiti plays a leading role, with the assistance of the United Nations Country 

Team (UNCT), 

 Welcoming the General Assembly’s resolution A/RES/71/161 on the United 

Nations ‘New Approach to Cholera in Haiti’; noting that the implementation of this 

new approach will fall under the responsibility of the UNCT under the coordination 

of a DSRSG/HC/RC,  

 Recognizing that strengthening national human rights institutions as well as 

respect for human rights, including of women and children, due process and 

combating criminality, sexual and gender-based violence, and putting an end to 

impunity and ensuring accountability are essential to ensuring the rule of law and 

security in Haiti, including access to justice,  

 Considering that with the completion of the MINUSTAH consolidation plan 

and the implementation of the transition plan, a broader framework of mutual 

accountability among the Government of Haiti, the United Nations and the 

international community could be developed as part of a country strategy to enhance 

the effectiveness of the support of the follow-on United Nations presence in the 

country, 

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 16 March 2017 

(S/2017/223), which includes observations and recommendations from the Strategic 

Assessment Mission requested by the Council in resolution 2313 (2016), and his 

recommendation that a new United Nations peacekeeping mission be established in 

Haiti following the termination of MINUSTAH by 15 October 2017, in order to 

continue to assist the Government of Haiti, to consolidate gains by reinforcing 

government institutions and strengthening the national capacity for rule of law, 

police development, and human rights,  

 Mindful of its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international 

peace and security under the Charter of the United Nations,  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, as described in 

section 1 of operative paragraph 7 of resolution 1542 (2004), and with regards to 

operative paragraphs 5 to 14 that relate to the new mission,

 3. Reaffirms that, in the framework of the improvement of the rule of law in 

Haiti, strengthening the justice sector and the capacity of the HNP, including in its

is paramount for the Government of Haiti to take timely and full responsibil ity for 

Haiti’s security needs;  

 4. Requests the Secretary-General to begin immediately to reduce 

MINUSTAH tasks in a phased manner ensuring that critical functions are defined 

and appropriate support capacity maintained, and further requests MINUSTAH to

Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH), as established in 

paragraph 5, and further strengthening the institutional and operational capacities of 

the HNP;  

 5. Decides to establish a follow-on peacekeeping mission in Haiti, 

MINUJUSTH, which shall be composed of up to seven Formed Police Units (FPUs)

period of six months from 16 October 2017 until 15 April 2018, and emphasizes the 

importance of reaching the above-mentioned levels;

HNP and that the number of FPUs shall be adjusted downward and harmonized with 

the gradual build-up of the HNP within a projected two-year timeframe; 

 9. Stresses that the 295 IPOs reduced from MINUSTAH’s authorized 1,001 

would play a key role in the implementation of the priorities in the HNP Strategic 

Development Plan 2017-2021; 

 10. Further underscores that the 38 government-provided corrections 

personnel reduced from the current level of 50 would play a key role in more fully 

engaging the HNP in efforts to strengthen the DAP management;  

 11. Decides that the rule of law efforts of MINUJUSTH, including 

community violence reduction efforts and quick impact projects, as appropriate, will
