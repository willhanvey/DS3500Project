 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions, in particular resolutions 1649 (2005), 1771

 Reaffirming its commitment to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and 
political independence of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of 
Rwanda as well as all States in the region, 

 Expressing its grave concern at the continued presence of the Forces 
démocratiques de libération du Rwanda (FDLR), ex-Rwandan Armed Forces 
(ex-FAR)/Interahamwe, and other Rwandan armed groups referred to in the joint 
communiqué (S/2007/679) of the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo and the Republic of Rwanda signed in Nairobi on 9 November 2007 (“the 
Nairobi Communiqué”) operating in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
which continue to pose a serious threat to the peace and security of the entire Great 
Lakes region, 

 Deploring the persistence of violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law carried out by the FDLR, ex-FAR/Interahamwe, and other 
Rwandan armed groups operating in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
condemning in particular sexual violence perpetrated by those groups, recalling its 
resolutions 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security and 1612 (2005) on children 
in armed conflict and the conclusions endorsed by the Security Council on Children 
And Armed Conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (S/AC.51/2007/17), 

 Recognizing the commitment and sustained efforts of the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo, the Republic of Rwanda, other countries of the region and their 
international partners to solve their common security concerns and achieve and 
sustain regional peace and stability, as expressed in particular in the Nairobi 
communiqué and the Conclusions of the high-level meeting of the Tripartite Plus 
Joint Commission held in Addis Ababa on 4 and 5 December 2007, 

 Recalling the signing in Nairobi on 15 December 2006 of the Pact on Security, 
Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region, and underscoring the 
commitments not to support rebel armed groups and to cooperate with a view to 
disarming and dismantling existing rebel armed groups,

08-27086 2 
 

 Welcoming the decision of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo to hold a meeting in Kisangani to address the issue of the presence of FDLR, 
ex-FAR/Interahamwe and other Rwandan armed groups in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo, 

 Supporting the ongoing efforts of the United Nations Organization Mission in 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) to promote the voluntary 
disarmament, demobilization, repatriation, resettlement and reintegration (DDRRR) 
of these groups, 

 Expressing also its grave concern at the continued presence of other armed 
groups and militias in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
which perpetuate a climate of insecurity in the whole region, underscoring that the 
statements of commitment (Actes d’engagement) signed in Goma on 23 January 
2008, together with the Nairobi communiqué, represent a major step towards the 
restoration of lasting peace and stability in the Great Lakes region, calling on the 
signatories to the Goma statements of commitment to take immediate action in 
support thereof, and expressing its intention to continue to monitor closely their 
implementation, 

 1. Demands that all members of the FDLR, ex-FAR/Interahamwe, and other 
Rwandan armed groups operating in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo 
immediately lay down their arms and present themselves without any further delay 
or preconditions to Congolese authorities and MONUC for their disarmament, 
demobilization, repatriation, resettlement and reintegration; 

 2. Demands also that the FDLR, ex-FAR/Interahamwe, and other Rwandan 
armed groups operating in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo 
immediately stop recruiting and using children, release all children associated with 
them, and put an end to gender-based violence, particularly rape and other forms of 
sexual abuse, and all other forms of violence, and stresses the need for those 
responsible to be brought to justice; 

 3. Recalls MONUC’s mandate to facilitate the voluntary demobilization and 
repatriation of disarmed foreign combatants and their dependants, and to use all 
necessary means, within the limits of its capacity and in the areas where its units are 
deployed, to support operations led by the integrated brigades of the Armed Forces 
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) with a view to disarming the 
recalcitrant armed groups in order to ensure their participation in the disarmament, 
demobilization, repatriation, resettlement and reintegration process; 

 4. Calls upon the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
and the Republic of Rwanda to intensify their cooperation to implement their 
commitments under the Nairobi communiqué, in particular with a view to creating 
the conditions conducive to the repatriation of demobilized combatants; 

 5. Recalls that the targeted measures including a travel ban and an asset 
freeze imposed by paragraphs 13 and 15 of resolution 1596 (2005) were extended by 
resolutions 1649 (2005) and 1698 (2006) to apply in particular to political and 
military leaders of armed groups operating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
who impede the disarmament and the voluntary repatriation or resettlement of 
combatants belonging to those groups, and stresses that those measures are 
applicable to leaders of the FDLR, ex-FAR/Interahamwe and other Rwandan armed 
groups designated in accordance with the provisions of those resolutions;

members of the FDLR, ex-FAR/Interahamwe or other Rwandan armed groups 
operating in the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo or to persons 
providing other forms of assistance to them; 

 7. Stresses that the arms embargo imposed by resolution 1493 (2003), as 
expanded by resolution 1596 (2005), prohibits the provision of arms and any related 
materiel or technical training and assistance to all foreign armed groups and illegal 
Congolese militias in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including the FDLR, 
ex-FAR/Interahamwe, and other Rwandan armed groups; 

 8. Calls upon Member States to consider taking the measures necessary to 
prevent the provision by their nationals or from their territories of any financial, 
technical or other forms of support to or for the benefit of the FDLR,  
ex-FAR/Interahamwe or other Rwandan armed groups operating in the territory of 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo;
