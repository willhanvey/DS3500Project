promoting the economic and social development of all peoples of the region will 

contribute significantly to stability, peace and security in the region,  

 Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the 

Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a 

view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to 

eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security, as 

well as their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen 

economic, social, cultural and environmental cooperation in the region,  

 Recognizing further that prospects for closer Euro-Mediterranean cooperation 

in all spheres can be enhanced by positive developments worldwide, in particular in 

Europe, in the Maghreb and in the Middle East,  

 Reaffirming the responsibility of all States to contribute to the stability and 

prosperity of the Mediterranean region and their commitment to respecting the

of the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations 

and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, 2 

 Noting the peace negotiations in the Middle East, which should be of a 

comprehensive nature and represent an appropriate framework for the peaceful 

settlement of contentious issues in the region,  

 Expressing concern at the persistent tension and continuing military activities 

in parts of the Mediterranean that hinder efforts to strengthen security and cooperation 

in the region,  

 Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General,3 

 1. Reaffirms that security in the Mediterranean is closely linked to European 

security as well as to international peace and security;  

 2. Expresses its satisfaction at the continuing efforts by Mediterranean 

countries to contribute actively to the elimination of all  causes of tension in the region 

and to the promotion of just and lasting solutions to the persistent problems of the 

region through peaceful means, thus ensuring the withdrawal of foreign forces of 

occupation and respecting the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of 

all countries of the Mediterranean and the right of peoples to self -determination, and 

therefore calls for full adherence to the principles of non-interference, 

non-intervention, non-use of force or threat of use of force and the inadmissibility of 

the acquisition of territory by force, in accordance with the Charter and the relevant 

resolutions of the United Nations;  

 3. Commends the Mediterranean countries for their efforts in meeting 

common challenges through coordinated overall responses, based on a spirit of 

multilateral partnership, towards the general objective of turning the Mediterranean 

basin into an area of dialogue, exchanges and cooperation, guaranteeing peace, 

stability and prosperity, encourages them to strengthen such efforts through, inter alia, 

a lasting multilateral and action-oriented cooperative dialogue among States of the 

region, and recognizes the role of the United Nations in promoting regional and 

international peace and security;

peace, security and cooperation among Mediterranean countries through the existing 

forums;  

 5. Calls upon all States of the Mediterranean region that have not yet done 

so to adhere to all the multilaterally negotiated legal instruments in force related to 

the field of disarmament and non-proliferation, thus creating the conditions necessary 

for strengthening peace and cooperation in the region;  

 6. Encourages all States of the region to favour the conditions necessary for 

strengthening the confidence-building measures among them by promoting genuine 

openness and transparency on all military matters, by participating, inter alia, in the

information to the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms;  

 7. Encourages the Mediterranean countries to strengthen further their 

cooperation in combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including the 

possible resort by terrorists to weapons of mass destruction, taking into account the 

relevant resolutions of the United Nations, and in combating international crime and 

illicit arms transfers and illicit drug production, consumpt ion and trafficking, which 

pose a serious threat to peace, security and stability in the region and therefore to the 

improvement of the current political, economic and social situation and which 

jeopardize friendly relations among States, hinder the development of international 

cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights, fundamental freedoms and 

the democratic basis of pluralistic society;  

 8. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its 

seventy-fifth session a report on means to strengthen security and cooperation in the 

Mediterranean region;  

 9. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-fifth session
