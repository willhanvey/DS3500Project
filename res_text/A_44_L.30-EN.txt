International financial pressure on the apartheid economy
of South Africa

The General Assembly,

Noting that the maintenance of the apartheid economy and the expansion of
military and police expenditures sUbstantially depend on the supply of further
credits and loans by the international fin~ncial community,

Deeply regretting that the participating banks in the Third Interim Agreement
with the apartheid regime, in spite of demands by the international community, have
recently announced the rescheduling of South Africa's external debt, which was due
for repayment in 1990,

Considering that the rescheduling of South Africa's external debt at this
particular time represents an attempt to undermine the efforts of the internationu
community to promote a peaceful resolution of the conflict in that country,

Taking note of the Kuala Lumpur Statement on Sou~hern Africa adopted by the
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting on 21 October 1989, ~I

1. Deplores the Third Interim Agreement, particularly its terms and timing,
which, by providing for the rescheduling over a period of three and a half years of
a significant part of South Africa's debt, lessens the financial pressure on the
apartheid regime;

2. Strongly urges Governments and private financial institutions to deny new
bank loans to South Africa, whether to the pUblic or private sectors;

3. Calls upon those States which continue to maintain trade and financial
links with So~th Africa to restrict the provision of trade credits and cease loan
insurance, in particular:

(a) By calling upon all the relevant banks and financial institutions to
impose stricter conditions on day-to-day trade financing, specifically through
reducing the maximum credit terms to 90 days;

(b) By taking South Africa "off cover" with official government agencies for
official trade credit and insurance purposes, thus making its acquisition of trade
credits more difficult;

4. Calls upon all Governments, intergovernmental and non-governmental
organizations to use all appropriate means to induce banks and other financial
institutions to give effect to the measures outlined above;

5. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its
forty-fifth session on the implementation of the present resolut30n.
