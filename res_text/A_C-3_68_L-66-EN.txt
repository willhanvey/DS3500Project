 Reaffirming the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United 
Nations concerning the strict observance of the principles of sovereign equality,

peoples, the non-use of force or of the threat of use of force in international 
relations and non-interference in affairs within the domestic jurisdiction of States, 

 Reaffirming also that, by virtue of the principle of self-determination, all 
peoples have the right freely to determine their political status and to pursue their 
economic, social and cultural development and that every State has the duty to 
respect this right in accordance with the provisions of the Charter, 

 Reaffirming further the Declaration on Principles of International Law 
concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the 
Charter of the United Nations,6 

 Welcoming the establishment of the open-ended intergovernmental working 
group of the Human Rights Council with the mandate of considering the possibility 
of elaborating an international regulatory framework, including the option of 
elaborating a legally binding instrument on the regulation, monitoring and oversight 
of the activities of private military and security companies, 

 Alarmed and concerned at the danger that the activities of mercenaries 
constitute to peace and security in developing countries, in various parts of the 
world, in particular in areas of conflict,  

 Deeply concerned at the loss of life, the substantial damage to property and the 
negative effects on the policy and economies of affected countries resulting from 
international criminal mercenary activities, 

 Extremely alarmed and concerned about recent mercenary activities in some 
developing countries in various parts of the world, including in areas of armed 
conflict, and the threat they pose to the integrity of and respect for the constitutional 
order of the affected countries, 

 Convinced that, notwithstanding the way in which mercenaries or mercenary-
related activities are used or the form that they take to acquire some semblance of 
legitimacy, they are a threat to peace, security and the self-determination of peoples 
and an obstacle to the enjoyment of all human rights by peoples, 

 1. Acknowledges with appreciation the work and contributions of the 
Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and 
impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination, including its 
research activities, and takes note with appreciation of its latest report;7 

 2. Reaffirms that the use of mercenaries and their recruitment, financing, 
protection and training are causes for grave concern to all States and violate the 
purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations; 

 3. Recognizes that armed conflict, terrorism, arms trafficking and covert 
operations by third Powers encourage, inter alia, the demand for mercenaries on the 
global market;

 4. Urges once again all States to take the steps necessary and to exercise 
the utmost vigilance against the menace posed by the activities of mercenaries and 
to take legislative measures to ensure that their territories and other territories under 
their control, as well as their nationals, are not used for the recruitment, assembly, 
financing, training, protection or transit of mercenaries for the planning of activities 
designed to impede the right of peoples to self-determination, to destabilize or 
overthrow the Government of any State or to dismember or impair, totally or in part, 
the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent States 
conducting themselves in compliance with the right of peoples to self-
determination; 

 5. Requests all States to exercise the utmost vigilance against any kind of 
recruitment, training, hiring or financing of mercenaries by private companies 
offering international military consultancy and security services, as well as to 
impose a specific ban on such companies intervening in armed conflicts or actions 
to destabilize constitutional regimes; 

 6. Encourages States that import the military assistance, consultancy and 
security services provided by private companies to establish regulatory national 
mechanisms for the registering and licensing of those companies in order to ensure 
that imported services provided by those private companies neither impede the 
enjoyment of human rights nor violate human rights in the recipient country; 

 7. Emphasizes its utmost concern about the impact of the activities of 
private military and security companies on the enjoyment of human rights, in

action necessary to accede to or ratify the International Convention against the 
Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries;8

parts of the world, in particular in areas of conflict, and the threat they pose to the 
integrity of and respect for the constitutional order of those countries and the 
exercise of the right of their peoples to self-determination, and stresses the 
importance for the Working Group of looking into sources and root causes, as well 
as the political motivations of mercenaries and for mercenary-related activities; 

 11. Calls upon States to investigate the possibility of mercenary involvement 
whenever and wherever criminal acts of a terrorist nature occur and to bring to trial 
those found responsible or to consider their extradition, if so requested, in 
accordance with national law and applicable bilateral or international treaties;

activities and to those responsible for the use, recruitment, financing and training of

 15. Requests the Working Group on the use of mercenaries to continue the 
work already done by previous Special Rapporteurs on the use of mercenaries on the 
strengthening of the international legal framework for the prevention and sanction 
of the recruitment, use, financing and training of mercenaries, taking into account 
the proposal for a new legal definition of a mercenary drafted by the Special 
Rapporteur on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and 
impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination in his report to 
the Commission on Human Rights at its sixtieth session;9  

 16. Requests the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, as a matter of priority, to publicize the adverse effects of the 
activities of mercenaries on the right of peoples to self-determination and, when 
requested and where necessary, to render advisory services to States that are affected 
by those activities; 

 17. Recommends that all Member States, including those confronted with the 
phenomenon of private military and security companies, as contracting States, States 
of operations, home States or States whose nationals are employed to work for a 
private military and security company, contribute to the work of the open-ended

current and future activities;
