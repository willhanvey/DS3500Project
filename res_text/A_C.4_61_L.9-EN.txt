  Assistance to Palestine refugees 
 
 

 The General Assembly,  

 Recalling its resolution 194 (III) of 11 December 1948 and all its subsequent 
resolutions on the question, including resolution 60/100 of 8 December 2005,  

 Recalling also its resolution 302 (IV) of 8 December 1949, by which, inter 
alia, it established the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine 
Refugees in the Near East,  

 Recalling further relevant Security Council resolutions,  

 Aware of the fact that, for more than five decades, the Palestine refugees have 
suffered from the loss of their homes, lands and means of livelihood,  

 Affirming the imperative of resolving the problem of the Palestine refugees for 
the achievement of justice and for the achievement of lasting peace in the region,  

 Acknowledging the essential role that the United Nations Relief and Works 
Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East has played for more than fifty-six 
years since its establishment in ameliorating the plight of the Palestine refugees in 
the fields of education, health and relief and social services,  



A/C.4/61/L.9  
 

06-60470 2 
 

 Taking note of the report of the Commissioner-General of the United Nations 
Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East covering the 
period from 1 January to 31 December 2005,1 

 Aware of the continuing needs of the Palestine refugees throughout all the 
fields of operation, namely, Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic and the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory,  

 Expressing grave concern at the especially difficult situation of the Palestine 
refugees under occupation, including with regard to their safety, well-being and 
living conditions,  

 Noting the signing of the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-
Government Arrangements on 13 September 1993 by the Government of Israel and 
the Palestine Liberation Organization2 and the subsequent implementation 
agreements,  

 Aware of the important role to be played in the peace process by the 
Multilateral Working Group on Refugees of the Middle East peace process,  

 1. Notes with regret that repatriation or compensation of the refugees, as 
provided for in paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), has not yet 
been effected, that, therefore, the situation of the Palestine refugees continues to be 
a matter of grave concern and that the Palestine refugees continue to require 
assistance to meet basic health, education and living needs;  

 2. Also notes with regret that the United Nations Conciliation Commission 
for Palestine has been unable to find a means of achieving progress in the 
implementation of paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), and 
reiterates its request to the Conciliation Commission to exert continued efforts 
towards the implementation of that paragraph and to report to the Assembly as 
appropriate, but no later than 1 September 2007;  

 3. Affirms the necessity for the continuation of the work of the United 
Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and the 
importance of its unimpeded operation and its provision of services for the well-
being of the Palestine refugees and for the stability of the region, pending the just 
resolution of the question of the Palestine refugees;  

 4. Calls upon all donors to continue to make the most generous efforts 
possible to meet the anticipated needs of the Agency, including with regard to 
increased expenditures arising from the deteriorating socio-economic and 
humanitarian situation in the region, particularly in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, and those mentioned in recent emergency appeals.
