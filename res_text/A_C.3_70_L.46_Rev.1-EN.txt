  Resolution 2200 A (XXI), annex. 



A/C.3/70/L.46/Rev.1 
 

 

15-20296 2/7 

 

 Welcoming the steps taken by some States to promote and give full effect to 

the Declaration, as well as by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 

Rights and some regional organizations in making the Declaration available and 

known to all stakeholders at the national and local levels in their re spective 

languages, and underlining the need to promote and give full effect to the 

Declaration, including through its translation into the various languages and its 

further dissemination with a view to its implementation in all regions,  

 Emphasizing the important role that individuals and civil society institutions, 

including non-governmental organizations, groups and national human rights 

institutions, play at the local, national, regional and international levels in the 

promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all,  

 Recognizing the substantial role that human rights defenders can play in 

supporting efforts to strengthen conflict prevention, peace and development through 

dialogue, openness, participation and justice, including by monitoring, reporting on 

and contributing to the promotion and protection of human rights,  

 Recognizing also the vital work of human rights defenders in promoting, 

protecting and advocating the realization of economic, social and cultural rights, 

and concerned that threats and attacks against human rights defenders, and 

hindrance of their work, have a negative impact on the realization of these rights, 

including as they relate to environmental and land issues as well as development,  

 Mindful that domestic law and administrative provisions and their application 

should not hinder, but enable the work of human rights defenders, including by 

avoiding any criminalization or stigmatization of the important activities and 

legitimate role of human rights defenders and the communities of which they are a 

part or on whose behalf they work, and by avoiding impediments, obstructions, 

restrictions or selective enforcement thereof contrary to relevant provisions of 

international human rights law,  

 Reaffirming that States have the primary responsibility and are under the 

obligation to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms of all persons,  

 Reaffirming also that national legislation consistent with the Charter of the 

United Nations and other international obligations of the State in the field of human 

rights and fundamental freedoms is the juridical framework within which human 

rights defenders conduct their activities,  

 Gravely concerned that national security and counter-terrorism legislation as 

well as measures in other areas, such as laws regulating civil society organizations, 

are in some instances misused to target human rights defenders or hinder their work, 

endangering their safety in a manner contrary to international law,  

 Recognizing the urgent need to address, and to take concrete steps to prevent 

and stop, the use of legislation to hinder or limit unduly the ability of human rights 

defenders to exercise their work, including by reviewing and, where necessary, 

amending relevant legislation and its implementation in order to ensure compliance 

with the obligations and commitments of States under international human rights 

law,  

 Gravely concerned by the considerable and increasing number of 

communications received by special procedures of the Human Rights Council 

documenting the serious nature of the risks faced by human rights defenders, 



 
A/C.3/70/L.46/Rev.1 

 

3/7 15-20296 

 

including women human rights defenders, and the prevalence of impunity for 

violations and abuses against them in many countries, where they face threats, 

harassment and attacks and suffer insecurity, including through restrictions on the 

rights to freedom of opinion, expression, association or peaceful assembly, abuse of 

criminal or civil proceedings, or deplorable acts of intimidation and reprisal 

intended to prevent their cooperation with the United Nations and other 

international bodies in the field of human rights,  

 Gravely concerned also that human rights defenders are subject to attacks, 

threats and other abuses by non-State actors, and underlining the need for the human 

rights and fundamental freedoms of all persons, including human rights defenders, 

to be respected and protected, 

 Welcoming the steps taken by some States, including in follow-up to relevant 

resolutions, the universal periodic review under the Human Rights Council, special 

procedures, treaty bodies and regional human rights mechanisms, towards the 

improvement of dialogue between authorities and civil society and towards the 

adoption of national policies and legislation that serve to create a safe and enabling 

environment and to recognize and protect human rights defenders, in particular from 

being prosecuted, in contravention of international human rights law, for peaceful 

activities, and against threats, harassment, intimidation, duress, arbitrary detention 

or arrest, enforced disappearance, violence and attacks by State and non -State 

actors,  

 Determined that dissenting views, including views on government and 

corporate policies related to or with an impact on human rights, may be expressed 

peacefully and communicated freely in society, online and offline, in accordance 

with international human rights law, and thereby emphasizing the importance  of 

respecting all human rights of all, and stressing in this regard the importance of 

independent voices of civic activity, human rights education and independent, 

impartial and competent national judicial systems,  

 Stressing in particular that information and communication technologies are 

important tools for the promotion of human rights and reporting on human rights 

violations and abuses, and concerned that such technologies are increasingly being 

used to monitor and hamper the work of human rights defenders,  

 Strongly reaffirming that everyone has the right, individually and in 

association with others, to promote and strive for the protection and realization of 

human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels, as 

laid out in the Declaration, including in the context of promoting the 

implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,
3
  

 1. Stresses that the right of everyone to promote and strive for the 

protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms without 

retaliation or fear thereof is an essential element in building and maintaining 

sustainable, open and democratic societies;  

 2. Calls upon all States to take all measures necessary to ensure the rights 

and safety of human rights defenders who exercise the rights to freedom of opinion, 

expression, peaceful assembly and association, which are essential for the 

promotion and protection of human rights;

publicly all cases of violence and discrimination against human rights defenders, 

including women human rights defenders;  

 5. Strongly condemns the violence against and the targeting, 

criminalization, intimidation, torture, disappearance, killing and thus silencing of

of international human rights law, for exercising their human rights and fundamental 

freedoms, such as the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and 

association, including in relation to cooperation with the United Nations or other 

international mechanisms in the area of human rights, and demands that States take 

concrete and definitive steps to prevent and put an end to the practice of the 

arbitrary arrest and detention of human rights defenders;  

 9. Reaffirms the urgent need to respect, protect, facilitate and promote the

public order and public morals, are minimally restrictive, clearly defined, 



 
A/C.3/70/L.46/Rev.1 

 

5/7 15-20296 

 

determinable, non-retroactive and compatible with relevant provisions of 

international human rights law;  

 (c) Measures to combat terrorism and preserve national security are in 

compliance with their obligations and commitments under international law, in

re-registration, and that such national provisions are in compliance with 

international human rights law;  

 (e) Procedural safeguards, including in criminal cases, are in place in 

accordance with international human rights law in order to avoid the use of 

unreliable evidence, unwarranted investigations and procedural delays, thereby 

effectively contributing to the expeditious closing of unsubstantiated cases, including 

against human rights defenders, and individuals are afforded the opportunity to lodge 

complaints directly with the appropriate authority, and respecting, inter alia, the right

discrimination and violence faced by women human rights defenders of all ages,
