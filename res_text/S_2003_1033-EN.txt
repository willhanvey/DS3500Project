Draft resolution

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its resolutions 955 (1994) of 8 November 1994, 1165 (1998) of 30
April 1998, 1329 (2000) of 30 November 2000, 1411 (2002) of 17 May 2002, 1431
(2002) of 14 August 2002 and 1503 (2003) of 28 August 2003,

Having considered the letter from the Secretary-General to the President of the
Security Council dated 12 September 2003 (S/2003/879) and the annexed letter from
the President of the International Tribunal for Rwanda addressed to the Secretary-
General dated 8 September 2003,

Having considered also the letter from the Secretary-General to the President
of the Security Council dated 3 October 2003 (S/2003/946) and the annexed letter
from the President of the International Tribunal for Rwanda addressed to the
Secretary-General dated 29 September 2003,

Convinced of the advisability of enhancing the powers of ad litem judges in the
International Tribunal for Rwanda so that, during the period of their appointment to
a trial, they might also adjudicate in pre-trial proceedings in other cases, should the
need arise and should they be in a position to do so,

Convinced also of the advisability of increasing the number of ad litem judges
that may be appointed at any one time to serve in the Trial Chambers of the
International Tribunal for Rwanda so that the Tribunal might be better placed to
complete all trial activities at first instance by the end of 2008, as envisaged in its
Completion Strategy,

Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,

1. Decides to amend articles 11 and 12 quater of the Statute of the
International Tribunal for Rwanda and to replace those articles with the provisions
set out in the annex to this resolution;

2. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
