The General Assembly,

Having considered the item entitled "The situation in the Middle East",

Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General of 25 October 1993, 1/

Recalling Security Council resolution 497 (1981) of 17 December 1981,

Recalling also its resolution 3314 (XXIX) of 14 December 1974, in the annex
to which it defined an act of aggression, inter alia, as "the invasion or attack
by the armed forces of a State of the territory of another State, or any
military occupation, however temporary, resulting from such invasion or attack,
or any annexation by the use of force of the territory of another State or part
thereof" and provided that "no consideration of whatever nature, whether
political, economic, military or otherwise, may serve as a justification for
aggression",

Reaffirming the fundamental principle of the inadmissibility of the
acquisition of territory by force,

Reaffirming once more the applicability of the Geneva Convention relative
to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, 2/ to
the occupied Syrian Golan,

Noting that Israel has refused, in violation of Article 25 of the Charter
of the United Nations, to accept and carry out Security Council resolution
497 (1981),

Deeply concerned that Israel has not withdrawn from the Syrian Golan, which
has been under occupation since 1967, contrary to the relevant Security Council
and General Assembly resolutions,

Taking note with satisfaction of the convening at Madrid of the Peace
Conference on the Middle East on the basis of Security Council resolutions
242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338 (1973) of 22 October 1973, but regretting
that just and comprehensive peace has not yet been achieved after two years of
negotiation at Washington, D.C.,

1. Declares that Israel has failed so far to comply with Security Council
resolution 497 (1981);

2. Declares once more that Israel’s decision to impose its laws,
jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan is illegal and
therefore null and void and has no validity whatsoever;

3. Declares that the Knesset decision of 11 November 1991 annexing the
occupied Syrian Golan constitutes a grave violation of Security Council
resolution 497 (1981) and therefore is null and void and has no validity
whatsoever;

4. Declares all Israeli policies and practices of, or aimed at,
annexation of the occupied Arab territories since 1967, including the occupied
Syrian Golan, to be illegal and in violation of international law and of the
relevant United Nations resolutions;

5. Determines once more that all actions taken by Israel to give effect
to its decisions relating to the occupied Syrian Golan are illegal and invalid
and shall not be recognized;

6. Reaffirms its determination that all relevant provisions of the
Regulations annexed to the Hague Convention IV of 1907, 3/ and the Geneva
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of
12 August 1949, 2/ continue to apply to the Syrian territory occupied by Israel
since 1967, and calls upon the parties thereto to respect and ensure respect for
their obligations under those instruments in all circumstances;

7. Determines once more that the continued occupation of the Syrian Golan
since 1967 and its de facto annexation by Israel on 14 December 1981, following
Israel’s decision to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on that
territory, constitute a continuing threat to peace and security in the region;

8. Firmly emphasizes once more its demand that Israel, the occupying
Power, rescind forthwith its illegal decision of 14 December 1981 to impose its

and Declarations of 1899 and 1907 (New York, Oxford University Press, 1915).

laws, jurisdiction and administration on the Syrian Golan, and its decision of
11 November 1991, which resulted in the effective annexation of that territory;

9. Demands once more that Israel withdraw from the occupied Syrian Golan
in implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions;

10. Calls upon the international community to urge Israel to withdraw from
the occupied Syrian Golan and other occupied Arab territories for the
establishment of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region;

11. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at
its forty-ninth session on the implementation of the present resolution.
