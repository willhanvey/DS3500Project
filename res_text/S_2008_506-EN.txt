draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming all its previous resolutions and presidential statements concerning 
the situation in Sudan, 

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, unity, independence and 
territorial integrity of Sudan and its determination to work with the Government of 
Sudan, in full respect of its sovereignty, to assist in tackling the various challenges 
in Sudan, 

 Recalling also its previous resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) on 
women, peace and security, 1502 (2003) on the protection of humanitarian and 
United Nations personnel, 1612 (2005) on children and armed conflict and the 
subsequent conclusions on the Sudan of the Working Group on Children in Armed 
Conflicts (S/AC.51/2008/7) as approved by the Council, and 1674 (2006) on the 
protection of civilians in armed conflict, which reaffirms inter alia the relevant 
provisions of the United Nations World Summit outcome document, as well as the 
report of its Mission to Sudan from 3 to 6 June 2008, 

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General and the Chairperson of the 
African Union Commission of 7 July 2008 (S/2008/443), and recalling the 
confirmation of President Bashir during his meeting with the Council that UNAMID 
shall be deployed in full, 

 Deploring, one year after the adoption of resolution 1769 (2007), the 
deterioration in the security and humanitarian situation in Darfur,  

 Stressing the need to enhance the safety and security of UNAMID personnel, 

 Noting with strong concern ongoing attacks on the civilian population and 
humanitarian workers and continued and widespread sexual violence, including as 
outlined in the reports of the Secretary-General, 

 Emphasizing the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and 
urging the Government of Sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect, and 
reiterating its condemnation of all violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law in Darfur, 

 Taking note of the African Union (AU) communiqué of the 142nd Peace and 
Security Council (PSC) Meeting dated 21 July (S/2008/481, annex), having in mind 



S/2008/506  
 

08-44596 2 
 

concerns raised by members of the Council regarding potential developments 
subsequent to the application by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court 
of 14 July 2008, and taking note of their intention to consider these matters further, 

 Reaffirming its concern that the ongoing violence in Darfur might further 
negatively affect the stability of Sudan as a whole as well as the region, noting with 
concern the ongoing tensions between the Governments of Sudan and Chad, and 
reiterating that a reduction in these tensions and rebel activity in both countries 
must be addressed to achieve long-term peace in Darfur and in the region, 

 Expressing its determination to promote and support the political process in 
Darfur, especially the new Chief Mediator, and deploring the fact that some groups 
refuse to join the political process, 

 Reiterating its deep concern for the decreasing security of humanitarian 
personnel, including killings of humanitarian workers, in Darfur and the hindering 
of their access to populations in need, condemning the parties to the conflict who 
have failed to ensure the full, safe and unhindered access of relief personnel as well 
as the delivery of humanitarian assistance, further condemning all instances of 
banditry and car-jackings, and recognizing that with many civilians in Darfur having 
been displaced humanitarian efforts remain a priority until a sustained cease-fire and 
inclusive political process are achieved,

bombing, and the use of civilians as human shields,
