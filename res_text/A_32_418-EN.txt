international co-operation in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space,
including the moon and other celestial bodies, and for developing the rule of law
in this sphere of human activity,

Convinced that, during the decade in which the Treaty has been in force, it
has played a positive role in the implementation of the purposes and principles of

instruments governing the outer space activities of States,

Noting that seventy-five States have become parties to the Treaty,

Recognizing that participation in the Treaty contributes to the peaceful
exploration and use of outer space for the benefit of all mankind, regardless of
the degree of economic or scientific development of States, and to the development
of mutual understanding and the strengthening of friendly relations among States
and peoples,

Recalling its resolutions 2260 (XXII) of 3 November 1967, 2453 (XXIII) of

the application of this international instrument by them can contribute to
enhancing the effectiveness of international co-operation in the peaceful
exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies,

1. Invites States which have not yet become parties to the Treaty on
Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer
Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial BOdies, to ratify or accede to it as
soon as possible;
