1654 (XVI) of 27 November 1961. The Committee was requested to examine the
application of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples, contained in Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of
14 December 1960, and to make suggestions and recommendations on the progress
and extent of the implementation of the Declaration.

necessary.

populations of those Territories to exercise their right to
self-determination and independence;

"(e) To take all necessary steps to enlist world-wide support among
Governments, as well as national and international organizations having a
special interest in decolonization, for the achievement of the objectives
of the Declaration and the implementation of the relevant resolutions of

"12. Calls upon the administering Powers to continue to cooperate with
the Special Committee in the discharge of its mandate and to permit the
access of visiting missions to the Territories to secure firsthand

49. The text of the resolution (A/AC.109/1051) adopted by the Special Committee
at its 1373rd meeting, on 15 August 1990, to which reference is made in
paragraph 48, is reproduced below:

The Special Committee,

Recalling the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples, contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)
of 14 December 1960, and the resolutions and decisions of the Special
Committee concerning Puerto Rico,

Having examined the report of the Rapporteur of the Special Committee
on the implementation of the resolutions concerning Puerto Rico, 10/

Having heard statements and testimony representative of various
viewpoints among the people of Puerto Rico and their social institutions,

Bearing in mind the agreement of the Puerto Rican political leadership
to request the President of the United States of America and the United
States Congress to adopt legislation with a view to consulting the people
of Puerto Rico so that they may express themselves freely, voluntarily and
democratically on their political future,

Also bearing in mind that the United States Congress is initiating a
legislative process, with the participation of the main political parties
of Puerto Rico, with a view to facilitating consultations with the people
of Puerto Rico on their political future, but that so far no law has been
adopted in this respect,

Aware of the appeal made by the President of the United States of
America, Mr. George Bush, to the Congress that it take the necessary steps
to allow the people of Puerto Rico to reach a decision through a
referendum,

1. Reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of Puerto Rico to
self-determination and independence, in conformity with General Assembly
resolution 1514 (XV), and the applicability of the fundamental principles
of that resolution with respect to Puerto Rico;

2. Expresses its hope, and that of the international community,
that, in accordance with the best interests of the people of Puerto Rico,
the dialogue should continue and that legal measures should be adopted
which will bring to a successful conclusion, as soon as possible, a process
leading to the self-determination of the Puerto Rican people;

3. Exhorts all the interested parties to cooperate so that the
people of Puerto Rico may exercise without hindrance their right to
self-determination with the express recognition of the people’s sovereignty
and full political equality, in conformity with the doctrine and practice
of the United Nations;

4. Requests the Rapporteur to report to the Special Committee on the
implementation of its resolutions concerning Puerto Rico;

5. Decides to keep the question of Puerto Rico under continuing
review.

-14-



50. On 24 August, the text of the resolution was transmitted to the Permanent
Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations for the
attention of his Government.

F. Consideration of other matters

1. Matters relating to the small Territories

51. At its 1362nd meeting on 22 January, by adopting the suggestions put
forward by the Chairman relating to the organization of the Committee’s work
(A/AC.109/L.1718), the Special Committee decided, inter alia, to include in its
agenda for the current session an item entitled "Matters relating to the small
Territories" and to consider it at its plenary meetings and at meetings of the
Subcommittee on Small Territories, as appropriate.

52. In taking these decisions, the Special Committee took into account the
provisions of the relevant General Assembly resolutions, including resolution
44/101 by paragraph 11 (d) of which the Assembly requested the Committee "to
continue to pay special attention to the small Territories, in particular
through the dispatch of visiting missions to those Territories whenever the
Special Committee deems it appropriate, and to recommend to the General Assembly
the most suitable steps to be taken to enable the populations of those
Territories to exercise their right to self-determination and independence".

53. During the year, the Special Committee and its Subcommittee on Small
Territories gave extensive consideration to all phases of the situation
obtaining in the small Territories (see chaps. IX and X of the present report).

2. Compliance of Member States with the Declaration and other
relevant resolutions on the question of decolonization

54. The Special Committee, at its 1362nd meeting, by adopting the suggestions
put forward by the Chairman relating to the organization of the Committee’s work
(A/AC.109/L.1718), decided, inter alia, to request the bodies concerned to take
the above item into consideration in the discharge of the tasks entrusted to
them by the Committee.

55. The subsidiary bodies accordingly took that decision into account in
examining the items referred to them for consideration. The Special Committee
also took that decision into account in its consideration of specific items in
plenary meetings.

3. Question of holding a series of meetings away
from Headquarters

56. The Special Committee, at its 1362nd meeting, by adopting the suggestions
put forward by the Chairman relating to the organization of the Committee’s work
(A/AC.109/L.1718), decided, inter alia, to take up the question of holding a
series of meetings away from Headquarters as appropriate and to refer it to its
Working Group for consideration and recommendations.

57. The Special Committee, having regard to its programme of work for 1991, at
its 1376th meeting, considered the question of holding meetings away from
Headquarters, taking into account the provisions of paragraph 6 of General

-15-



Assembly resolution 1654 (XVI) of 27 November 1961 and paragraph 3 (9) of
resolution 2621 (XXV) of 12 October 1970, by which the Assembly authorized the
Committee to meet elsewhere than at United Nations Headquarters whenever and
wherever such meetings might be required for the effective discharge of its
functions. Also at its 1376th meeting, by approving the recommendations
contained in the 97th report of its Working Group (A/AC.109/L.1748), the
Committee decided, inter alia, to include in the appropriate section of its
report to the Assembly a statement to the effect that it might consider
accepting, subject to the availability of the requisite conference services and
facilities, such invitations as might be received in that connection in 1991 and
that, when particulars of such meetings became known, it would request the
Secretary-General to seek the necessary budgetary provision in accordance with
established procedure.

4. Pattern of conferences

58. The Special Committee, at its 1362nd meeting, by adopting the suggestions
put forward by the Chairman relating to the organization of the Committee’s work
(A/AC.109/L.1718), decided, inter alia, to take up as appropriate an item
entitled "Pattern of conferences" and to refer it to its Working Group for
consideration and recommendations. In so doing, the Committee was conscious of
the fact that it had initiated some important measures in rationalizing its work
methods, many of which were subsequently incorporated in a number of resolutions
and decisions of the General Assembly. Further recalling the measures it had
taken heretofore in that connection, the Committee decided to continue to
exercise its initiatives in the effective utilization of the limited conference
resources and the further reduction of its documentation requirements.

59. During the year, the Committee also continued the practice of circulating
communications and information material, as far as possible, in the form of
informal notes and aides-mémoire in the original language of submission, thus
curtailing documentation requirements by some 4,000 pages and accruing
considerable savings for the Organization. A list of the official documents
issued by the Committee during 1990 is contained in the annex to the present
chapter.

60. The Special Committee, at its 1376th meeting, considered the item on the
basis of the recommendations contained in the 97th report of the Working Group
(A/AC.109/L.1748). The relevant paragraphs of that report read as follows:

"5. The Working Group noted that during the year the Special Committee had
closely followed the guidelines set forth in the resolutions of the General
Assembly on the pattern of conferences, in particular resolution 43/222 of
21 December 1988. By organizing its programme of work accordingly and by
holding extensive consultations and working in informal sessions, the
Committee had been able to curtail the number of its formal meetings
considerably. 11/

"6. The Working Group decided to recommend that the Special Committee
should intensify its endeavour in this regard. The Working Group also
decided to recommend that the Committee should continue to monitor closely
its utilization of the conference-servicing resources requested and to
minimize the wastage resulting from cancellation of scheduled meetings.

-16-



"7. The Working Group decided to recommend that, in the light of the
experience of the Special Committee in previous years and taking into
account the probable workload for 1991, the Committee should consider
holding its meetings during 1991 in the following manner:

(a) Plenary

February/June As required

warranted. It was also understood that the Special Committee might, in
early 1991, review the programme of meetings for that year on the basis of
any developments which might affect its work, and which would help to
rationalize conference servicing resources.

"9. With regard to the programme of meetings of the Special Committee for

I. Review of work 19/

110. As noted in chapter II of the present report, the programme of work of the
Special Committee for the year was heavy in consequence of the fact that, in
addition to its annual review of developments in colonial Territories, the
Committee was requested by the General Assembly, in its resolution 44/100 of
11 December 1989, to undertake a series of activities in observance of the
thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to
Colonial Countries and Peoples. In so doing, the Assembly emphasized that the
commemoration of the thirtieth anniversary would be an appropriate occasion to
evaluate the progress achieved during the past 30 years in the implementation of
the Declaration, as well as the role played by the United Nations and its system
of organizations in that regard, and to formulate specific measures for the
elimination of all remnants of colonialism in all its forms and manifestations
in various areas of the world.

111. Pursuant to the provisions of General Assembly resolution 44/100, the
Special Committee undertook during its 1990 session a number of activities in
observance of the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration. These activities
included the holding of regional seminars in Vanuatu and Barbados, an account of
which is set out in chapter II of the present report. On the basis of the views
expressed by the representatives and in light of the ensuing consultations, the
Special Committee, as requested in resolution 44/100, formulated a draft
resolution on the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration (A/AC.109/L.1753), to
be submitted to the General Assembly for consideration at its forty-fifth
session. By adopting the draft resolution, the Assembly would recommend to
States, the competent United Nations organs, the specialized agencies and other
organizations of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations
further measures towards the full and speedy implementation of the Declaration.

112. In accordance with the mandate entrusted to it by the General Assembly, the
Special Committee continued at its 1990 session to seek suitable means for the
immediate and full implementation of Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) in all
Territories that had not yet attained independence and it formulated specific
proposals for the elimination of the remaining manifestations of colonialism, as
reflected elsewhere in the present report. A brief outline of decisions adopted
by the Committee during the year is given below.

113. As regards the decolonization of Territories, the majority of which are
island Territories scattered over a wide span of oceans, the Special Committee
reiterated its conviction that questions of territorial size, geographical

-25-



isolation or limited resources did not in any way affect the inalienable right
of the inhabitants of those Territories to self-determination and independence
in accordance with the Declaration. The Committee reiterated also that it was
the responsibility of the administering Powers to create such conditions in
those Territories as would enable their peoples to exercise freely and without
interference their inalienable right to self-determination and independence in
accordance with the Declaration. The Committee reaffirmed that it was
ultimately for the people of those Territories themselves to determine their
future political status in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and the Declaration. In that connection, the Committee also reaffirmed
the importance of fostering an awareness among the peoples of the possibilities
open to them in the exercise of their right to self-determination. The
Committee’s capacity to assist in expediting the decolonization process in
respect of the Territories concerned was again enhanced during the year as a
result of the continued cooperation extended to it by the Governments of New
Zealand, Portugal and the United States as administering Powers, in accordance
with established procedure. The United Kingdom and France did not participate
in the related work of the Committee during the year. The Committee hoped that
the two Governments would reconsider their position in that regard.

114. In the same context, the Special Committee, aware of the importance of
securing adequate, first-hand information on the political, economic and social
conditions prevailing in the colonial Territories, as well as on the views and
aspirations of their inhabitants, stressed the need to continue to dispatch
visiting missions to those Territories in order to facilitate the speedy and
effective implementation of the Declaration. The Committee called upon the
administering Powers to cooperate or continue to cooperate with the United
Nations in that connection.

115. On the question of the implementation of the Declaration by the specialized
agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations,
the Special Committee noted the assistance extended thus far to colonial
Territories and considered that such assistance should be expanded further,
commensurate with the pressing needs of the peoples concerned for external
assistance, and reaffirmed the responsibility of the specialized agencies and
other organizations of the United Nations system to take all the necessary
measures, within their respective spheres of competence, to ensure the full and
speedy implementation of all relevant United Nations resolutions. In stressing
the importance of securing additional resources for funding expanding programmes
of assistance for the peoples concerned and the need to enlist the support of
the major funding institutions within the United Nations system in that regard,
the Committee reiterated that the organizations concerned should initiate or
broaden contacts and cooperation with the colonial peoples and the administering
Powers concerned to intensify programmes of assistance and urged the executive
heads of those organizations to submit to their governing and legislative organs
concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant United Nations
decisions, particularly specific programmes of assistance to the peoples of the
colonial Territories and their national liberation movements. The Committee
also urged the executive heads of the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund to introduce flexible procedures to prepare specific programmes for the
peoples of the colonial Territories. In noting with grave concern the extensive
links and collaboration between the apartheid regime of South Africa and certain
countries in the political, diplomatic, economic, nuclear, military and other
fields, and the growing military and nuclear cooperation between racist Pretoria
and Israel, the Committee condemned those extensive links and collaboration and
growing cooperation. The Committee stressed, in the context of the Declaration
on Apartheid and its Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa, the need for

-26-



the specialized agencies and other organizations in the United Nations system to
render all possible assistance to the front-line and neighbouring States to
enable them to rebuild their economies, which have been adversely affected by
South Africa’s acts of aggression and destabilization, to withstand any further
such acts and to continue to support the people of South Africa. In welcoming
the continued initiative exercised by the United Nations Development Programme
in maintaining close liaison among the specialized agencies and other
organizations of the United Nations system, and in coordinating the activities
of the agencies in extending effective assistance to the peoples of colonial
Territories, the Committee called upon the organizations of the United Nations
system, as a matter of urgency, to contribute generously to the relief,
rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts in those Non-Self-Governing
Territories affected by natural disasters.

116. As concerns activities of foreign economic and other interests impeding the
implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples in colonial Territories, the Special Committee reaffirmed
that any economic or other activity that impeded the implementation of the
Declaration and obstructed efforts aimed at the elimination of colonialism,
apartheid and racial discrimination in southern Africa and other colonial
Territories was in direct violation of the rights of the inhabitants and of the
principles of the Charter and all relevant resolutions of the United Nations.
The Committee also reaffirmed the inalienable right of the peoples of those
Territories to self-determination and independence and to the enjoyment of their
natural resources. The Committee further reaffirmed that the activities of
foreign economic, financial and other interests operating at present in the
colonial Territories constituted a major obstacle to political independence and
racial equality. The Committee strongly condemned the collaboration of certain
Western countries, in particular Israel, with the racist minority regime of
South Africa in the nuclear field. The Committee called upon all Governments
that had not yet done so to take effective measures to terminate all
collaboration with the racist regime of South Africa, in particular in respect
of their nationals and the bodies corporate under their jurisdiction that owned
and operated enterprises in colonial Territories that were detrimental to the
interests of the inhabitants of those Territories. The Committee called upon
those oil-producing and oil-exporting countries that had not yet done so to take
effective measures to terminate the supply of crude oil and petroleum products
to the racist regime of South Africa. The Committee urged the administering
Powers concerned to take effective measures to safeguard and guarantee the
inalienable right of the peoples of the colonial Territories to their natural
resources and to establish and maintain control over the future development of
those resources.

117. With respect to the military activities and arrangements by colonial Powers
in Territories under their administration which might be impeding the
implementation of the Declaration, the Special Committee reaffirmed its strong
conviction that the presence of military bases and installations in the colonial
and Non-Self-Governing Territories could constitute a major obstacle to the
implementation of the Declaration and that it was the responsibility of the
administering Powers to ensure that the existence of such bases and
installations did not hinder the populations of the Territories from exercising
their right to self-determination and independence in conformity with the
purposes and principles of the Charter and the Declaration. Further, the
Committee urged the administering Powers to continue to take all necessary
measures not to involve the Territories concerned in any offensive acts or
interference against other States and to comply fully with the purposes and
principles of the Charter, the Declaration and the resolutions and decisions of

-27-



the United Nations relating to military activities and arrangements by colonial
Powers in Territories under their administration. The Committee once again
called upon the administering Powers concerned to terminate such activities and
dismantle such military bases. The Committee reiterated that the colonial
Territories and areas adjacent thereto should not be used for nuclear testing,
dumping of nuclear wastes or deployment of nuclear and other weapons of mass
destruction. The Committee condemned the continuing support to the racist
regime of South Africa in the military and nuclear fields and expressed its
concern at the grave consequences for international peace and security of the
collaboration between the racist regime of South Africa and certain Western
Powers, Israel and other countries. It called upon them to end all such
collaboration. The Committee also deprecated the continued alienation of land
in colonial Territories for military installations.

118. On the question of the publicity to be given to the work of the United
Nations in the field of decolonization, the Special Committee again stressed the
need to mobilize world public opinion in support of the peoples of colonial
Territories and their national liberation movements in their efforts to achieve
self-determination, freedom and independence. Bearing in mind the important
role being played by an increasing number of non-governmental organizations
active in the field of decolonization, and pursuant to General Assembly
resolution 44/100 on the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration, the Committee
held two regional seminars, inter alia, with non-governmental organizations
based in the Pacific and Caribbean regions. The seminars, one held at
Port Vila, Vanuatu, in May 1990 and the other at Bridgetown, Barbados, in June,
were attended by the representatives of some 24 non-governmental organizations.
An account of the seminars is set out in chapter II of the present report. As
reflected in the report, the Committee invited those organizations to continue
and intensify their campaign against the evils and dangers of colonialism, as
well as their support for all colonial peoples. The Committee considered it
essential that concrete measures be taken to intensify the dissemination of
information on decolonization issues - publicizing the activities of United
Nations organs in the field of decolonization and providing wider dissemination
of information on all colonial Territories. The Committee requested the
Department of Public Information of the Secretariat to intensify its information
activities on decolonization, both at United Nations Headquarters and through
the effective deployment of the United Nations information centres, and report
thereon to the Committee.

119. During the year, the Special Committee also continued its review of the
list of Territories to which the Declaration is applicable. As regards its
decision of 17 August 1989 concerning Puerto Rico, the Committee heard a number
of representatives of organizations concerned and adopted a further resolution
on the matter (A/AC.109/1051), which is set out in paragraph 49 of the present
chapter.

120. In accordance with the guidelines established by the General Assembly, the
Special Committee was able during the year to reduce to a minimum the number of
its formal meetings and to minimize the wastage resulting from cancellation of
scheduled meetings.

-28-



J. Future work

121. In accordance with the mandate entrusted to it in the relevant General
Assembly resolutions, and subject to any further directives which it may receive
from the General Assembly during the latter’s forty-fifth session, the Special
Committee intends during 1990 to pursue its efforts in seeking the best ways and
means for the immediate and full implementation of the Declaration in all
Territories that have not yet attained independence. In particular, the
Committee will keep under scrutiny developments concerning each Territory, as
well as the compliance by all States, in particular the administering Powers,
with the relevant decisions and resolutions of the United Nations. On the basis
of that review, the Committee will submit conclusions and recommendations on the
specific measures necessary to achieve the objectives set out in the Declaration
and the relevant provisions of the Charter.

122. The Special Committee will continue to make concrete suggestions which
could assist the Security Council in considering appropriate measures under the
Charter with regard to developments in colonial Territories that are likely to
threaten international peace and security.

123. The Special Committee will continue to pay special attention to the small
Territories, whenever possible by dispatching visiting missions to those
Territories, and to recommend to the General Assembly the most suitable steps to
be taken to enable the populations of those Territories to exercise their right
to self-determination and independence. In making those recommendations, the
Committee will take into consideration the summaries of discussions contained in
the reports of the two regional seminars, which might serve as a basis in
formulating programmes appropriate for follow-up action. The Committee also
intends to continue its review of the list of Territories to which the
Declaration is applicable.

124. The Special Committee intends to continue its consideration of further
measures to bring an end to the activities of foreign economic and other
interests which are impeding the implementation of the Declaration in
Territories under colonial domination and efforts to eliminate colonialism,
apartheid and racial discrimination in southern Africa. Further, the Committee
intends to continue its study of military activities and arrangements by
colonial Powers in Territories under their administration which might be
impeding the implementation of the Declaration.

125. The Special Committee plans to continue its consideration of the
implementation of the Declaration by the specialized agencies and the
international institutions associated with the United Nations. In so doing, the
Committee will once again review the action taken or envisaged by international
organizations in the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the General
Assembly. The Committee will hold further consultations and contacts with those
organizations, as appropriate. The Committee will also be guided by the results
of further consultations, to be held in 1990, between its Chairman and the
President of the Economic and Social Council within the context of the relevant
decisions of the Assembly, the Council and the Committee itself. Further, the
Committee will maintain close contact on a regular basis with the
Secretary-General of OAU and senior members of the organization, with a view to
facilitating the effective implementation of the decisions of the various United
Nations bodies by the specialized agencies and other organizations concerned.

126. In its resolutions relating to specific Territories, the General Assembly
has repeatedly called upon the administering Powers to cooperate or continue to

-29-



cooperate with the Special Committee by permitting access of visiting missions
to the Territories under their administration. Having regard to the
constructive role played by previous United Nations visiting missions to
colonial Territories, the Committee continues to attach vital importance to the
dispatching of such missions as a means of collecting adequate and first-hand
information on conditions in the Territories and on the wishes and aspirations
of the people concerning their future status. Accordingly, the Committee will
continue to seek the full cooperation of the administering Powers in order to
obtain such information through the sending, as appropriate, of visiting
missions to Territories.

127. Conscious of the importance which the General Assembly attaches to the need
for a continuous world-wide campaign of publicity in the field of
decolonization, the Special Committee will give its continuous attention to the
question of dissemination of information on decolonization. In particular, the
Committee expects to continue its review of the relevant programmes of
publications and other information activities envisaged by the Department of
Public Information and the Department for Special Political Questions, Regional
Cooperation, Decolonization and Trusteeship. The Committee will again make
appropriate recommendations, for consideration by the Assembly, on the ways and
means of ensuring the widest possible dissemination of the relevant information.
The Assembly will no doubt wish to urge the administering Powers to cooperate
with the Secretary-General in promoting the large-scale dissemination of
information in the Territories concerned.

128. In view of the importance that it attaches to the role of non-governmental
organizations active in the field of decolonization in support of the peoples of
the dependent Territories, the Special Committee will continue to seek the close
collaboration of such organizations with a view, inter alia, to enlisting their
support in the dissemination of the relevant information and in the mobilization
of world public opinion in the cause of decolonization. To that end, it is the
Committee’s intention also to continue to participate in conferences, seminars
and other special meetings dealing with decolonization, arranged by those
organizations, as well as such meetings as may be organized by the United
Nations bodies concerned and other intergovernmental organizations.

129. Taking into account the views expressed by the representatives of the
remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories at the seminars organized by the
Special Committee in Vanuatu and Barbados in observance of the thirtieth
anniversary of the Declaration (A/AC.109/1040 and Corr.1 and A/AC.109/1043), the
Committee will consider, in cooperation with the administering Powers, how to
intensify and improve the participation of the representatives of those
Territories in the work of the Committee within the existing resources.

130. In the light of the provisions of the General Assembly resolutions
concerning the pattern of conferences, and taking into consideration its
experience in previous years, as well as its probable workload for next year,
the Special Committee has approved a tentative programme of meetings
for 1991-1992, which it commends for approval by the Assembly. In the same
connection, as authorized by the Assembly, the Committee intends to meet
elsewhere than at United Nations Headquarters whenever and wherever such
meetings might be required for the effective discharge of its functions.
Subject to the availability of the requisite conference services and facilities,
the Committee will consider accepting such invitations as might be received in
that connection in 1991 and, when particulars of such meetings become known, it
would request the Secretary-General to seek the necessary budgetary provision in
accordance with established procedure.

-30-



131. The Special Committee suggests that, when the General Assembly examines the
question of the implementation of the Declaration at its forty-fifth session, it
may wish to take into account the various recommendations of the Committee which
are reflected in the relevant chapters of the present report and, in particular,
to endorse the proposals outlined in the present section in order to enable the
Committee to carry out the tasks it envisages for 1991. In addition, the
Committee recommends that the Assembly should renew its appeal to the
administering Powers to take all necessary steps for the implementation of the
Declaration and the relevant United Nations resolutions, in accordance with the
freely expressed wishes of the peoples of the Territories concerned. In this
connection, the Committee recommends that the Assembly should again request the
administering Powers to cooperate or continue to cooperate with the Committee in
the discharge of its mandate and, in particular, to participate actively in the
work relating to the Territories under their respective administrations.
Bearing in mind the affirmation by the Assembly that direct association of the
Non-Self-Governing Territories in the work of the United Nations and the
specialized agencies is an effective means of promoting the progress of the
peoples of those Territories towards a position of equality with States Members
of the United Nations, the Committee also recommends that the Assembly should
continue to invite the administering Powers to allow representatives of the
Territories concerned to participate in the discussions in the Fourth Committee
and the Special Committee of the items relating to their respective territories.
Further, the Assembly might also wish to renew its appeal to all States, the
specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system to
comply with the various requests addressed to them by the Assembly and the
Security Council in their relevant resolutions.

132. The Special Committee recommends that, in approving the programme of work
outlined above, the General Assembly should make adequate provision to cover the
activities the Committee envisages for 1991. In this regard, the Special
Committee recalls that in his proposed programme budget for the biennium
1990-1991, the Secretary-General has included estimates in respect of the
regular programme of work of the Special Committee for 1990 and 1991 based on
the level of activities approved for the year 1989, without prejudice to the
decisions to be taken by the General Assembly at its forty-fifth and forty-sixth
sessions. On that basis, the Special Committee understands that adequate
provisions would be approved by the General Assembly. Should the Committee
decide to hold a series of meetings away from Headquarters (see para. 130)
within the context of paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 1654 (XVI) and
paragraph 3 (9) of Assembly resolution 2621 (XXV) and when particulars of such
meetings become available, it is understood that the Secretary-General will,
subject to the availability of the requisite conference services and facilities,
seek the necessary budgetary provision in accordance with established procedure.
Finally, the Committee expresses the hope that the Secretary-General will
continue to provide it with all the facilities and personnel necessary for the
discharge of its mandate, taking into account the various tasks assigned to it
by the Assembly as well as those arising from decisions taken by it during the
current year.

K. Conclusion of the 1990 session

133. The Special Committee, at its 1363rd meeting, on 1 August, decided to

General Assembly, in accordance with established practice.

CHAPTER II*

THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DECLARATION ON THE GRANTING OF
INDEPENDENCE TO COLONIAL COUNTRIES AND PEOPLES

A. General

1. At its forty-fourth session, the General Assembly, bearing in mind that the
year 1990 would mark the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration on the
Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and on the
recommendation of the Special Committee, adopted the Programme of Activities in
Observance of the Thirtieth Anniversary of the Declaration as set out in the
annex to its resolution 44/100 of 11 December 1989.

2. By adopting resolution 44/100, the General Assembly emphasized that the
commemoration of the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration would be an
appropriate occasion to evaluate the progress achieved during the past 30 years
in the implementation of the Declaration, as well as the role played by the
United Nations and its system of organizations in that regard. It would also,
in the light of General Assembly resolution 43/47 of 22 November 1988, on the
International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, provide the opportunity
to formulate specific measures for the elimination of all remnants of
colonialism in all its forms and manifestations in various areas of the world.
To that end, the Assembly envisaged a Programme of Activities, contained in the
annex to the resolution, excerpts from which are set forth below:

"Commemorative meeting of the General Assembly

"2. The General Assembly shall hold a special commemorative meeting
in observance of the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration, it being
understood that the specific modalities and procedures for the
commemoration (recognition of contributions made by individuals) would be
the subject of subsequent consultations between the President of the
General Assembly and the Chairman of the Special Committee on the Situation
with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.

"...

"Commemorative declaration to be adopted
by the General Assembly

"3. The Special Committee shall prepare the draft text of a
commemorative declaration to be submitted to the General Assembly at its
forty-fifth session. ...

"Seminars to be held by the Special Committee

"4. The Special Committee shall hold in 1990 two regional seminars on
the subject of decolonization.

* Previously issued under the symbol A/45/23 (Part II).

-42-



"...

"9. The Special Committee shall organize, in close consultation with
the Department of Public Information of the Secretariat, a seminar on
dissemination of information on decolonization to be held at United Nations
Headquarters. Participants would include journalists accredited to the
United Nations and representatives of non-governmental organizations,
universities and other educational and research institutions etc.

"..."

3. The Committee considered the item at its 1363rd to 1366th and 1376th
meetings, between 1 and 20 August 1990. In addition, the Chairman of the
Committee held a series of informal meetings and consultations throughout the
year in connection with the item.

4. An account of the regional seminars held by the Committee, in accordance
with the foregoing resolution of the General Assembly, is set out in section B.
The Committee’s decisions concerning the seminar at United Nations Headquarters
and the study envisaged on the seminars are set out in sections C and D,
respectively.

5. An account of the Special Committee’s preparation of the text of a draft
resolution on the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration, for submission to
the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session, is set out in section E.

B. Regional seminars

6. By its resolution 44/100, the General Assembly envisaged the holding of two
regional seminars by the Special Committee, one in the Asia/Pacific region and
the other in the Caribbean.

7. Availing itself of the readiness of the Governments of Vanuatu and Barbados
to serve as host to the seminars, the Special Committee held the regional
seminar in the Asia/Pacific region at Port Vila, from 9 to 11 May 1990, and the
regional seminar in the Caribbean region at Bridgetown, from 19 to 21 June 1990.

8. The two regional seminars focused on the subject of decolonization and
considered the following themes:

(a) Self-determination: its application to small Territories,
particularly to the case of small islands;

(b) Economic and social development in the small Territories and their
impact on the exercise of the right of the peoples of those Territories to
self-determination;

(c) Environmental problems affecting small islands;

(d) Protection of natural resources, particularly marine resources, for
the benefit of the populations of small islands and Territories;

(e) Protection of land for island populations and dangers of foreign
exploitation;

-43-



(f) Heightening of awareness of options concerning future political
status;

(g) Colonialism and racial discrimination;

(h) Self-determination and regional integration of small islands;

(i) Foreign economic interests and/or activities in the small Territories,
with particular concern for the views of the populations concerned;

(j) Consequences of the military use of small islands.

9. The regional seminars were presided over by the Chairman of the Special
Committee with the participation of the following members of the Committee:

In Vanuatu: Chile, Fiji, Indonesia, Norway, Tunisia, United Republic of
Tanzania (Rapporteur) and Yugoslavia;

In Barbados: Afghanistan, China, Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba (Rapporteur),
Czechoslovakia, Norway and Trinidad and Tobago.

In addition, the seminars were attended by 2 administering Powers,
8 representatives of Non-Self-Governing Territories, 3 United Nations Members
representing regional organizations, 7 United Nations bodies,
4 intergovernmental bodies, 2 specialized agencies, 24 special guests, 24
non-governmental organizations and 1 observer.

10. A detailed account of the organization, proceedings and summary of
discussions of the seminars is contained in the reports prepared by their
respective rapporteurs, Mr. Samuel A. Mdee of the United Republic of Tanzania
and Mrs. María Cecilia Bermúdez of Cuba.

11. At its 1364th meeting, on 2 August 1990, the Chairman drew attention to the
reports of the two regional seminars (Vanuatu, A/AC.109/1040 and Corr.1, and
Barbados, A/AC.109/1043).

12. The Special Committee considered the reports of the two regional seminars
at its 1363rd to 1365th, and 1376th meetings, in connection with its
consideration of the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration.

13. The Chairman and the following Member States, in the course of their
statements in the general debate on the thirtieth anniversary of the
Declaration, made reference to the reports of the two regional seminars: the
Chairman at the 1363rd meeting (A/AC.109/PV.1363); Norway, the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics, Fiji and Czechoslovakia at the 1364th meeting
(A/AC.109/PV.1364); Indonesia at the 1365th meeting (A/AC.109/PV.1365); and
Sierra Leone at the 1376th meeting (A/AC.109/PV.1376).

14. At the 1376th meeting, on 20 August, following a statement by the Chairman
(A/AC.109/PV.1376), the Committee adopted, without objection, the reports of the
two regional seminars referred to in paragraph 11. By adopting the two reports,
the Committee noted that the main objective of those seminars, as stated in the
guidelines and rules of procedure for the seminars (A/AC.109/1022), was to
undertake a comprehensive review of the specific problems of the remaining
Non-Self-Governing Territories and that the contributions of participants,
particularly those from Non-Self-Governing Territories, should help the
Committee to chart a more effective course for its work and to adjust its

-44-



approach and methodology in the fulfilment of its mandate. Further, the
Committee decided to make use, wherever possible, of the proposals and
suggestions made at the seminars with a view to enhancing and rationalizing its
work in a continuing process (see also section D).

C. Seminar at United Nations Headquarters

15. The Special Committee, at its 1376th meeting on 20 August 1990, considered
the item on the basis of the recommendation contained in the 97th report of the
Working Group (A/AC.109/L.1748). The relevant paragraphs of that report read as
follows:

"14. The Working Group decided to recommend to the Special Committee that
the seminar intended to be held at Headquarters, as provided for in General
Assembly resolution 44/100 of 11 December 1989 relating to the Programme of
Activities in observance of the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration,
be postponed to 1991. Such a postponement would give the Committee the
time it needs to study a proposal made by some non-governmental
organizations at the two regional seminars held in 1990 in Vanuatu and
Barbados. The proposal recommends that participants in the seminar at
Headquarters include representatives of a cross-section of the peoples of
Non-Self-Governing Territories, in particular the youth of those
Territories. It is further suggested that the seminar at Headquarters
should provide the opportunity to assess the impact of the seminars already
held in order to draw the appropriate conclusions for the future. It is
the understanding of the Working Group that, as soon as the Committee
approves this suggestion, the non-governmental organizations which made the
proposal would begin the fund-raising process to cover as much of the cost
of the participation of invitees from Non-Self-Governing Territories as
possible.

"15. The Working Group likewise decided to recommend to the Committee
that, subject to the availability of the requisite conference services and
facilities, the seminar at United Nations Headquarters be held in early
1991."

16. At the same meeting, the Special Committee approved, without objection, the
above-mentioned recommendations.

D. Follow-up to the seminars organized in 1990 by the
Special Committee in observance of the thirtieth
anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples

17. The Special Committee, also at its 1376th meeting on 20 August 1990,
considered the item on the basis of the recommendation contained in the 97th
report of the Working Group (A/AC.109/L.1748). The relevant paragraph of that
report reads as follows:

"16. The guidelines and rules of procedure for the regional seminars held
by the Special Committee in 1990 in observance of the thirtieth anniversary
of the above Declaration stated that those seminars would provide the basis
for a comprehensive review of the specific problems of the remaining small
Non-Self-Governing Territories and that contributions from participants
would help the Special Committee to chart a more effective course for its

-45-



work with regard to the speedy implementation of the Declaration in those
Territories. On the basis of that review, a reassessment of the
Committee’s work, as well as its approach and methodology with regard to
the implementation of its mandate, should be undertaken (A/AC.109/1022).
In the light of the foregoing, the Working Group decided to recommend that
the Committee study, on the basis of a working paper to be prepared by the
Secretariat for its 1991 session, how best to translate into concrete
actions the relevant proposals put forward at those seminars, taking into
account, in particular, the views expressed by the representatives of the
remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories."

18. At the same meeting, the Special Committee approved, without objection, the
above-mentioned recommendation.

E. Thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting
of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples

1. Consideration by the Special Committee

19. The Special Committee, at its 1362nd meeting on 22 January 1990, by
adopting the suggestions relating to the organization of its work put forward by
the Chairman (A/AC.109/L.1718), decided, inter alia, to allocate the above item
to the Working Group and plenary meetings of the Committee, as appropriate.

20. The Special Committee considered the item at its 1363rd to 1366th and
1376th meetings, between 1 and 20 August 1990.

21. During its consideration of the item, the Special Committee had before it
the reports of the two regional seminars referred to in paragraph 11.

22. Statements in the general debate were made as follows: the Chairman at the
1363rd meeting (A/AC.109/PV.1363); the Islamic Republic of Iran, Norway, the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Fiji and Czechoslovakia at the 1364th
meeting (A/AC.109/PV.1364); the Syrian Arab Republic, Afghanistan, Indonesia,
China and Côte d’Ivoire at the 1365th meeting (A/AC.109/PV.1365); Yugoslavia,
Ethiopia, Cuba and Chile at the 1366th meeting (A/AC.109/PV.1366); and Sierra
Leone at the 1376th meeting (A/AC.109/PV.1376).

2. Consideration of the draft resolution

23. At the 1376th meeting on 20 August, the Chairman drew attention to draft
resolution A/AC.109/L.1753, submitted by him after consultations with the
members of the Special Committee.

24. At the same meeting, the Committee adopted the draft resolution
(A/AC.109/L.1753) without a vote. The Chairman made a statement
(A/AC.109/PV.1376).

3. Decision of the Special Committee

25. The text of the resolution (A/AC.109/1055) adopted by the Special Committee
at its 1376th meeting, on 20 August 1990, to which reference is made in
paragraph 24, is reproduced below:

-46-



The Special Committee,

Recalling the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples, contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)
of 14 December 1960,

Recalling also General Assembly resolution 43/47 of 22 November 1988,
entitled "International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism",

Having held, in the year of the forty-fifth anniversary of the United
Nations, a special plenary meeting in observance of the thirtieth
anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples,

Recalling the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, in
which the peoples of the world proclaimed their determination to reaffirm
faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human
person and in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and
small and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger
freedom,

Recalling also the relevant provisions of the Declaration on
Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and
Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United
Nations, 1/

Recalling further General Assembly resolutions 2621 (XXV) of
12 October 1970, containing the programme of action for the full
implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to
Colonial Countries and Peoples, and 35/118 of 11 December 1980, the annex
to which contains the Plan of Action for the Full Implementation of the
Declaration, as well as Assembly resolution 40/56 of 2 December 1985,

Considering that the process of national liberation is irresistible
and irreversible, and recalling that the Declaration solemnly proclaimed
the necessity speedily and unconditionally to put an end to colonialism in
all its forms and manifestations,

Recognizing the significant and commendable role played by the United
Nations, since its very inception, in the field of decolonization and
noting the emergence, during this period, of more than one hundred States
into sovereign existence, in particular noting with satisfaction the
attainment of independence by Namibia following the holding of free and
fair elections under the supervision and control of the United Nations, and
the subsequent admission of independent Namibia as a Member of the United
Nations on 23 April 1990,

Noting with satisfaction, in particular, that during the past thirty
years a large number of former colonial Territories have achieved
independence, mainly through the courageous liberation struggle carried out
by the peoples of those countries, led by their national liberation
movements, and that many former Trust and Non-Self-Governing Territories
have exercised their right to self-determination and independence in
accordance with the Declaration,

Noting also with satisfaction the important contribution made by the
Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the

-47-



Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples in furthering the aims and objectives of the Declaration with a
view to the liberation of peoples from colonial rule,

Noting further with satisfaction the active and important role being
played by former colonial Territories, as States Members of the United
Nations and members of the other organizations of the United Nations system
in the realization of the purposes and principles of the Charter, the
preservation of international peace and security, decolonization and the
promotion of human progress, as well as the profound impact thereof on
contemporary international relations,

Conscious of the fact that the Declaration has played an important
role in assisting the peoples under colonial rule and will continue to
serve as an inspiration in their efforts to achieve self-determination and
independence in accordance with the Charter and in mobilizing world public
opinion for the complete elimination of colonialism in all its forms and
manifestations,

Noting with satisfaction the work accomplished by the two regional
seminars held by the Special Committee in Vanuatu and Barbados on the
occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration, 2/

Deeply concerned at the fact that, thirty years after the adoption of
the Declaration, colonialism in the world has not yet been totally
eradicated,

Reaffirming that all peoples have the right to self-determination and
independence and that the subjection of peoples to colonial domination
constitutes a denial of fundamental human rights and is a serious
impediment to the maintenance of international peace and security and the
development of peaceful relations among nations,

Increasingly aware of the importance of economic, social and cultural
development and self-reliance of colonial countries and peoples for the
attainment and consolidation of genuine independence,

Convinced that the total eradication of racial discrimination,
apartheid and violations of the basic human rights of the peoples in the
remaining colonial Territories will be achieved peacefully and most
expeditiously by the faithful and complete implementation of the
Declaration,

Noting that the large majority of the remaining Non-Self-Governing
Territories are small island Territories,

Determined to take effective measures leading to the complete and
unconditional elimination of colonialism in all its forms and
manifestations without further delay,

1. Reaffirms the inalienable right of all peoples under colonial
rule to self-determination and independence in accordance with the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples, contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV);

2. Declares that the continuation of colonialism in all its forms
and manifestations, including racism and apartheid, is incompatible with

-48-



the Charter of the United Nations, the Declaration and the principles of
international law;

3. Expresses its conviction that the thirtieth anniversary of the
Declaration should provide an opportunity for Member States to rededicate
themselves to the principles and objectives enunciated in that document and
for concerted efforts to be made to remove the last vestiges of colonialism
in all regions of the world;

4. Strongly condemns South Africa’s aggressive activities and acts
of destabilization against neighbouring independent African States and its
policies of apartheid, as well as its acquisition of nuclear-weapon
capability, the use of which would heighten tension and increase the threat
to regional as well as international peace and security;

5. Calls upon Member States, in particular colonial Powers, to take
effective steps with a view to the complete, unconditional and speedy
eradication of colonialism in all its forms and manifestations and to the
faithful and strict observance of the relevant provisions of the Charter,
the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 3/ as well as other
relevant resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly and those of the
Security Council;

6. Urges Member States to do their utmost to promote, in the United
Nations and the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United
Nations system, effective measures for the full and speedy implementation
of the Declaration in all colonial Territories to which the Declaration
applies;

7. Calls upon Member States to render, as a matter of urgency, all
moral and material assistance to the peoples under colonial rule in their
struggle to exercise their right to self-determination and independence, in
accordance with the Charter and the Declaration;

8. Urges the administering Powers and other Member States to ensure
that the activities of foreign economic and other interests in colonial
Territories do not run counter to the interests of the inhabitants of those
Territories and do not impede the implementation of the Declaration;

9. Urges Member States to discontinue all economic, financial, trade
and other relations with the racist minority regime of South Africa that
run counter to the Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive
Consequences in Southern Africa 4/ and to refrain from entering into any
relations which may lend legitimacy or support to its policies of
apartheid;

10. Requests Member States, as well as the organizations of the
United Nations system, to ensure that the permanent sovereignty of the
colonial Territories over their natural resources is fully respected and
safeguarded;

11. Reiterates the view that such factors as territorial size,
geographical location, size of population and limited natural resources
should in no way delay the speedy exercise by the peoples of the
Non-Self-Governing Territories of their inalienable right to
self-determination and independence in conformity with the Declaration

-49-



contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), which fully applies to
the dependent Territories;

12. Reaffirms that all administering Powers are obliged, under the
Charter and in accordance with the Declaration, to create economic, social
and other conditions in the Territories under their administration which
will enable those Territories to achieve genuine independence and economic
self-reliance;

13. Requests the administering Powers concerned to adopt the
necessary measures to discourage or prevent any systematic influx of
immigrants and settlers into the Territories under their administration
which might disrupt the demographic composition of those Territories and
prevent the genuine exercise of the right of self-determination and
independence by their peoples, and to avoid any forced displacement,
complete or partial, of the population of colonial Territories;

14. Further requests the administering Powers to preserve the
cultural identity, as well as the national unity, of the Territories under
their administration and to encourage the full development of the
indigenous culture with a view to facilitating the unfettered exercise of
the right to self-determination and independence by the peoples of those
Territories;

15. Reaffirms its strong conviction that the presence of all kinds of
military bases and installations in colonial Territories could constitute a
major obstacle to the implementation of the Declaration and that it is the
responsibility of the administering Powers concerned to ensure that the
existence of such bases and installations does not hinder the peoples of
the Territories from exercising their right to self-determination and
independence in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter
and the Declaration;

16. Calls upon the administering Powers concerned to continue to take
all necessary measures not to involve those Territories in any offensive
acts or interference against other States and to comply fully with the
purposes and principles of the Charter, the Declaration and the resolutions
and decisions of the United Nations relating to military activities and
arrangements by colonial Powers in the Territories under their
administration;

17. Requests Member States, in particular the administering Powers,
to adopt appropriate measures to prevent the recruitment, financing,
training and transit of mercenaries in their Territories for use against
the national liberation movements struggling for freedom and independence
from the yoke of colonialism, racism and apartheid;

18. Considers it incumbent upon the United Nations to continue to
play an active role in the process of decolonization and to intensify its
efforts for the widest possible dissemination of information on
decolonization with a view to the further mobilization of international
public opinion in support of complete decolonization;

19. Urges Member States to ensure the full and speedy implementation
of the Declaration contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and
other relevant resolutions of the United Nations;

-50-



20. Requests the specialized agencies and other organizations of the
United Nations system to render, or continue to render, within their
respective spheres of competence, all possible moral and material
assistance to the peoples of the colonial Territories and to their national
liberation movements, to take measures to withhold from the apartheid
regime of South Africa any form of collaboration or assistance in the
financial, economic and technical fields and to discontinue all support to

respectively, the Special Committee recommends to the General Assembly the
adoption of the following draft resolution:

Thirtieth Anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples

The General Assembly,

Recalling the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples, contained in its resolution 1514 (XV) of
14 December 1960,

Recalling also its resolution 43/47 of 22 November 1988, entitled
"International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism",

Having held, in the year of the forty-fifth anniversary of the United
Nations, a special plenary meeting in observance of the thirtieth
anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples,

-51-



Recalling the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, in
which the peoples of the world proclaimed their determination to reaffirm
faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human
person and in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and
small and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger
freedom,

Recalling also the relevant provisions of the Declaration on
Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and
Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United
Nations, 1/

Recalling further its resolutions 2621 (XXV) of 12 October 1970,
containing the programme of action for the full implementation of the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples, and 35/118 of 11 December 1980, the annex to which contains the
Plan of Action for the Full Implementation of the Declaration, as well as
its resolution 40/56 of 2 December 1985,

Considering that the process of national liberation is irresistible
and irreversible, and recalling that the Declaration solemnly proclaimed
the necessity speedily and unconditionally to put an end to colonialism in
all its forms and manifestations,

Recognizing the significant and commendable role played by the United
Nations, since its very inception, in the field of decolonization and
noting the emergence, during this period, of more than one hundred States
into sovereign existence, in particular noting with satisfaction the
attainment of independence by Namibia following the holding of free and
fair elections under the supervision and control of the United Nations, and
the subsequent admission of independent Namibia as a Member of the United
Nations on 23 April 1990,

Noting with satisfaction, in particular, that during the past thirty
years a large number of former colonial Territories have achieved
independence, mainly through the courageous liberation struggle carried out
by the peoples of those countries, led by their national liberation
movements, and that many former Trust and Non-Self-Governing Territories
have exercised their right to self-determination and independence in
accordance with the Declaration,

Noting also with satisfaction the important contribution made by the
Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples in furthering the aims and objectives of the Declaration with a
view to the liberation of peoples from colonial rule,

Noting further with satisfaction the active and important role being
played by former colonial Territories, as States Members of the United
Nations and members of the other organizations of the United Nations system
in the realization of the purposes and principles of the Charter, the
preservation of international peace and security, decolonization and the
promotion of human progress, as well as the profound impact thereof on
contemporary international relations,

Conscious of the fact that the Declaration has played an important
role in assisting the peoples under colonial rule and will continue to

-52-



serve as an inspiration in their efforts to achieve self-determination and
independence in accordance with the Charter and in mobilizing world public
opinion for the complete elimination of colonialism in all its forms and
manifestations,

Noting with satisfaction the work accomplished by the two regional
seminars held by the Special Committee in Vanuatu and Barbados on the
occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration, 2/

Deeply concerned at the fact that, thirty years after the adoption of
the Declaration, colonialism in the world has not yet been totally
eradicated,

Reaffirming that all peoples have the right to self-determination and
independence and that the subjection of peoples to colonial domination
constitutes a denial of fundamental human rights and is a serious
impediment to the maintenance of international peace and security and the
development of peaceful relations among nations,

Increasingly aware of the importance of economic, social and cultural
development and self-reliance of colonial countries and peoples for the
attainment and consolidation of genuine independence,

Convinced that the total eradication of racial discrimination,
apartheid and violations of the basic human rights of the peoples in the
remaining colonial Territories will be achieved peacefully and most
expeditiously by the faithful and complete implementation of the
Declaration,

Noting that the large majority of the remaining Non-Self-Governing
Territories are small island Territories,

Determined to take effective measures leading to the complete and
unconditional elimination of colonialism in all its forms and
manifestations without further delay,

1. Reaffirms the inalienable right of all peoples under colonial
rule to self-determination and independence in accordance with the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples, contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV);

2. Declares that the continuation of colonialism in all its forms
and manifestations, including racism and apartheid, is incompatible with
the Charter of the United Nations, the Declaration and the principles of
international law;

3. Expresses its conviction that the thirtieth anniversary of the
Declaration should provide an opportunity for Member States to rededicate
themselves to the principles and objectives enunciated in that document and
for concerted efforts to be made to remove the last vestiges of colonialism
in all regions of the world;

4. Strongly condemns South Africa’s aggressive activities and acts
of destabilization against neighbouring independent African States and its
policies of apartheid, as well as its acquisition of nuclear-weapon
capability, the use of which would heighten tension and increase the threat
to regional as well as international peace and security;

-53-



5. Calls upon Member States, in particular colonial Powers, to take
effective steps with a view to the complete, unconditional and speedy
eradication of colonialism in all its forms and manifestations and to the
faithful and strict observance of the relevant provisions of the Charter,
the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 3/ as well as other
relevant resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly and those of the
Security Council;

6. Urges Member States to do their utmost to promote, in the United
Nations and the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United
Nations system, effective measures for the full and speedy implementation
of the Declaration in all colonial Territories to which the Declaration
applies;

7. Calls upon Member States to render, as a matter of urgency, all
moral and material assistance to the peoples under colonial rule in their
struggle to exercise their right to self-determination and independence, in
accordance with the Charter and the Declaration;

8. Urges the administering Powers and other Member States to ensure
that the activities of foreign economic and other interests in colonial
Territories do not run counter to the interests of the inhabitants of those
Territories and do not impede the implementation of the Declaration;

9. Urges Member States to discontinue all economic, financial, trade
and other relations with the racist minority regime of South Africa that
run counter to the Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive
Consequences in Southern Africa 4/ and to refrain from entering into any
relations which may lend legitimacy or support to its policies of
apartheid;

10. Requests Member States, as well as the organizations of the
United Nations system, to ensure that the permanent sovereignty of the
colonial Territories over their natural resources is fully respected and
safeguarded;

11. Reiterates the view that such factors as territorial size,
geographical location, size of population and limited natural resources
should in no way delay the speedy exercise by the peoples of the
Non-Self-Governing Territories of their inalienable right to
self-determination and independence in conformity with the Declaration
contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), which fully applies to
the dependent Territories;

12. Reaffirms that all administering Powers are obliged, under the
Charter and in accordance with the Declaration, to create economic, social
and other conditions in the Territories under their administration which
will enable those Territories to achieve genuine independence and economic
self-reliance;

13. Requests the administering Powers concerned to adopt the
necessary measures to discourage or prevent any systematic influx of
immigrants and settlers into the Territories under their administration
which might disrupt the demographic composition of those Territories and
prevent the genuine exercise of the right of self-determination and

-54-



independence by their peoples, and to avoid any forced displacement,
complete or partial, of the population of colonial Territories;

14. Further requests the administering Powers to preserve the
cultural identity, as well as the national unity, of the Territories under
their administration and to encourage the full development of the
indigenous culture with a view to facilitating the unfettered exercise of
the right to self-determination and independence by the peoples of those
Territories;

15. Reaffirms its strong conviction that the presence of all kinds of
military bases and installations in colonial Territories could constitute a
major obstacle to the implementation of the Declaration and that it is the
responsibility of the administering Powers concerned to ensure that the
existence of such bases and installations does not hinder the peoples of
the Territories from exercising their right to self-determination and
independence in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter
and the Declaration;

16. Calls upon the administering Powers concerned to continue to take
all necessary measures not to involve those Territories in any offensive
acts or interference against other States and to comply fully with the
purposes and principles of the Charter, the Declaration and the resolutions
and decisions of the United Nations relating to military activities and
arrangements by colonial Powers in the Territories under their
administration;

17. Requests Member States, in particular the administering Powers,
to adopt appropriate measures to prevent the recruitment, financing,
training and transit of mercenaries in their Territories for use against
the national liberation movements struggling for freedom and independence
from the yoke of colonialism, racism and apartheid;

18. Considers it incumbent upon the United Nations to continue to
play an active role in the process of decolonization and to intensify its
efforts for the widest possible dissemination of information on
decolonization, with a view to the further mobilization of international
public opinion in support of complete decolonization;

19. Urges Member States to ensure the full and speedy implementation

other relevant resolutions of the United Nations;

20. Requests the specialized agencies and other organizations of the
United Nations system to render, or continue to render, within their
respective spheres of competence, all possible moral and material
assistance to the peoples of the colonial Territories and to their national
liberation movements, to take measures to withhold from the apartheid
regime of South Africa any form of collaboration or assistance in the
financial, economic and technical fields and to discontinue all support to
that regime until apartheid has been eradicated and a non-racial, united
and democratic State based on the will of all South African people has been
established in accordance with the relevant resolutions and decisions of
the General Assembly, including the Declaration on Apartheid and its
Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa, and those of the Security
Council;

-55-



21. Invites non-governmental organizations having a special interest
in the field of decolonization to intensify their activities in cooperation
with the United Nations;

22. Requests the Special Committee to continue to examine the full
compliance of all States with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and
other relevant resolutions on the question of decolonization, to seek the

to all Territories to which it applies and to propose to the General
Assembly specific measures for the complete implementation of the
Declaration in the remaining colonial Territories;

23. Invites all States to cooperate fully with the Special Committee
in the complete fulfilment of its mandate.

F. Other matters

27. At the 1376th meeting, the Chairman informed the Committee that, in

centres should intensify their activities in connection with the Week. In this
connection, United Nations information centres and other United Nations field
offices should organize public information programmes, particularly for
non-governmental organizations active in the field of decolonization, for the
promotion of the Week, using printed and audio-visual materials provided by
Headquarters;

(j) The Special Committee should also request that information on all
colonial Territories be given wider dissemination during the Week.

10. In accordance with the above decision (see para. 9 (a)), the Chairman of
the Special Committee issued the following statement on 21 May in commemoration
of the Week of Solidarity:

Statement issued by the Chairman on 21 May 1990 on the
Week of Solidarity

"In 1972, the General Assembly, in its resolution 2911 (XXVII),
addressed an appeal to the Governments and peoples of the world to observe
annually a Week of Solidarity with the Colonial Peoples of Southern Africa.
The Week was to start on 25 May, which marks Africa Liberation Day. At
that time, a large part of southern Africa remained under colonial rule,
and heroic wars of liberation were being waged in the region.

"In 1982, the General Assembly expanded the scope of the Week of
Solidarity to include its support for the peoples of all other dependent
Territories, as well as those in South Africa fighting for freedom,
independence and human rights. This was in conformity with the purposes
and tenets embodied in the United Nations Charter, in particular the
reaffirmation of faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and
worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women, and of
nations large or small. It was also in full accord with the principles
enshrined in the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to
Colonial Countries and Peoples which, inter alia, proclaimed that immediate
steps should be taken to transfer all powers to the peoples of Territories
which have not yet attained independence, without any conditions and in
accordance with their freely expressed will and desire, in order that they
might enjoy complete independence and freedom.

"During the past 18 years, in Africa alone, the world community has
witnessed the accession to independence of 10 Territories, thus enabling
some 28 million men and women of that continent to achieve their
long-sought-after freedom from colonial rule. In the same period, some 26
colonial Territories in Africa and elsewhere have acceded to independence,
many of them becoming full-fledged members of the world community. This

-59-



year, it is with a deep sense of satisfaction that we note the historic
accession to independence of Namibia after decades of untold suffering and
sacrifices endured by the Namibian people. While hailing the people of
Namibia for their gallantry and heroism in the course of the protracted
struggle they had to wage against the colonial Power, the Committee pays a
special tribute to the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General of the
United Nations and his Special Representative and indeed the entire United
Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) team for successfully carrying
out the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). The
efforts of the international community over the past four decades in
respect of Namibia have been richly rewarded in the final achievement by
the Namibian people of the objectives of the Charter of the United Nations
and the Declaration on decolonization.

"As we are all aware, the newly independent Namibia will have to
grapple with exigencies of independent nationhood which will require
enormous financial, material and technical resources; thus, the volume of
external assistance needed to meet these challenges cannot be
overemphasized. In this connection, I appeal to the international
community to contribute generously at the forthcoming United Nations
Pledging Conference for Namibia, which is scheduled to be held next month.

"In South Africa, the liberation of Nelson Mandela and the
legalization of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and
other political organizations give rise to the hope for the sustained
conduct of a meaningful dialogue between the apartheid regime and the
majority of the population. The relaxation of tension at the international
level and prevailing political milieu in the world and in South Africa
augur well for a decisive, united course of action designed to restore to
the peoples of South Africa their long-deprived fundamental rights, to put
an irrevocable end to the inhuman, repressive policy and practice of
apartheid.

"On the occasion of the Week of Solidarity, the Special Committee pays
a particular tribute to all those courageous peoples who have given their
lives to the cause of freedom and justice for colonial peoples everywhere,
as well as to those many other patriots who have been imprisoned, detained
or restricted for no reason other than their opposition to the inhuman
system of apartheid, or who are otherwise banned and restricted because of
their actions in support of the oppressed peoples of southern Africa.

"In observance of the Week of Solidarity this year, I wish on behalf
of the Special Committee to urge all Member States to mobilize maximum
support for the peoples of South Africa and elsewhere struggling for
freedom, independence and equal rights by effecting the widest possible
dissemination of information on their just cause and by encouraging and
securing support actions in their favour of all media operating under the
jurisdiction of Member States.

"Aware that this year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples, the Special Committee, under the terms of General Assembly
resolution 44/100, has envisaged a number of commemorative events during
the year. These events will provide excellent opportunity to pledge the
international community’s renewed dedication to the eradication of
colonialism, apartheid and racial discrimination. They will also afford an
appropriate opportunity to evaluate the activities undertaken by the United

-60-



Nations over the past 30 years to promote the decolonization of the
remaining dependent small Territories and, in the light of that evaluation,
to formulate a specific programme of measures designed to speed up that
process.

"Indeed, as called for in the resolution of the General Assembly
referred to above, the Special Committee will be submitting a number of
recommendations in that regard to the Assembly for its consideration at its
forty-fifth session this fall. The Chairman wishes to express his
confident hope that those recommendations of the Committee will further
facilitate the efforts of the Organization towards the final elimination of
colonialism in all its forms."

C. Other decisions of the Special Committee

11. The 280th report of the Subcommittee (A/AC.109/L.1721), adopted by the
Special Committee at its 1364th meeting, on 2 August 1990 (see para. 7),
contained the following conclusions and recommendations:

(1) The Special Committee reiterates the importance of the United
Nations effecting the widest possible dissemination of true, accurate and
topical information on decolonization as an instrument for furthering the
purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples, contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of
14 December 1960, and for mobilizing world public opinion in support of the
peoples of colonial Territories and their national liberation movements in
their efforts to achieve self-determination, freedom and independence.

(2) The Special Committee condemns the extensive links and
collaboration between the apartheid regime of South Africa and certain
Western countries and, especially, Israel in the political, economic,
nuclear, military and other fields. The Committee also strongly denounces
any attempts to misrepresent the struggle of the peoples of colonial
Territories for freedom and independence as terrorist activities and to
label the national liberation movements as terrorist organizations. The
Committee therefore considers it imperative for the United Nations to take
all possible steps to intensify its activities in the field of
dissemination of information in order to counter such attempts and to make
the international community and world public opinion aware that recognition
by the United Nations of the legitimacy of the liberation struggle by the
people of all colonial Territories entails as a corollary the extension of
all moral and material support to them and their national liberation
movements.

(3) The Special Committee reiterates the great importance it attaches
to the work of the Department for Special Political Questions, Regional
Cooperation, Decolonization and Trusteeship. It should be recalled that
the Information Unit on Decolonization in that Department was created in
pursuance of General Assembly resolution 3164 (XXVIII) of 14 December 1973
in order to collect, prepare and disseminate, on a continuous basis and in
consultation with the Special Committee and the Department of Public
Information, basic material, studies and articles relating to the problems
of decolonization. The Committee urges the Department for Special
Political Questions, Regional Cooperation, Decolonization and Trusteeship
to take all necessary steps to enable it to continue to discharge its

-61-



mandate, taking into account all the Territories under consideration by the
Committee.

(4) While noting the active participation of the Department of Public
Information in the work of the Committee and its efforts to produce and
disseminate information on decolonization, to monitor the responses
received from the United Nations information centres and to report thereon,
the Special Committee requests the Department:

(a) To continue to intensify, through all the means at its

(5) The Special Committee requests the Department of Public
Information to provide it with feedback reports from the United Nations
information centres regarding their activities of dissemination of
information on decolonization and, in particular, on the activities
undertaken in 1990 in relation to the celebration of the Week of Solidarity
with the Peoples of All Colonial Territories, as well as Those in South
Africa, Fighting for Freedom, Independence and Human Rights, prior to the
consideration of the celebration of the Week by the Subcommittee in 1991.

(6) The Special Committee urges the Department of Public Information
to intensify its efforts to ensure that information bodies provide better
coverage of decolonization in all regions, in particular in some countries
in Western Europe and North America.

(7) The Special Committee requests the Department for Special
Political Questions, Regional Cooperation, Decolonization and Trusteeship,
in cooperation with the Department of Public Information, to increase its
speaking engagements at university campuses across North America and, if
requested, in other regions on the subject of decolonization and to inform
the Subcommittee of the experience and the results achieved.

(8) The Special Committee requests the Department of Public
Information and the Department for Special Political Questions, Regional

-63-



Cooperation, Decolonization and Trusteeship to continue to take into
consideration the important role being played by non-governmental
organizations in the decolonization process and in the dissemination of
information on the situation in all the remaining colonial Territories
under consideration by the Committee, by monitoring the activities of
foreign economic interests impeding the implementation of the Declaration
and by disseminating information on the aims, objectives and activities of
national liberation movements. The Committee requests the two Departments
to continue and intensify their cooperation with non-governmental
organizations in the dissemination of information on decolonization,
particularly through briefings on colonial issues and through the provision
of relevant printed materials on decolonization.

(9) The Special Committee appeals to the mass media to regard it as
their task to contribute to the elimination of the remaining manifestations
of colonialism by disseminating information on the current problems of
decolonization and to render support to the peoples of the colonial
countries.

(10) The Special Committee further appeals to the mass media to
contribute to increasing public awareness of the close link between the
struggle against colonialism and the struggle for international peace and
security, in conformity with the provisions of the Charter and of the
Declaration.

(11) The Special Committee expresses the view that the mass media
could provide broader coverage of events and activities relating to the
struggle against colonialism, such as conferences, seminars and round
tables, as well as meetings of United Nations organs dealing with a
particular question, and the publication and wide distribution of pertinent
resolutions and decisions of such bodies.

(12) The Special Committee should continue, in pursuance of its
mandate, to consider new ways and means of increasing the effectiveness of
the dissemination of information relating to decolonization. To that end,
the Committee should, inter alia, hold consultations with non-United
Nations media interested in the dissemination of information on
decolonization.

12. The 282nd report of the Subcommittee (A/AC.109/L.1723), adopted by the
Special Committee at its 1364th meeting, on 2 August 1990 (see para. 7)
contained the following conclusions and recommendations:

(1) The Special Committee expresses the view that non-governmental
organizations are playing an important role in the decolonization process,
particularly through their widespread dissemination of information on the
situation in the remaining colonial Territories, that is, by disseminating
information on the position of the United Nations with regard to
decolonization, by monitoring the activities of foreign economic interests
impeding the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in General
Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, by disseminating
information on the aims, objectives and activities of the national
liberation movements and by providing assistance to colonial peoples and
their national liberation movements, including those in South Africa, and
other national liberation movements internationally recognized, in their

-64-



struggle for freedom, self-determination, national independence and human
rights.

(2) The Special Committee encourages non-governmental organizations
active in the field of decolonization to continue and intensify their
campaign against the evils and dangers of colonialism in all its forms and
manifestations by, inter alia, supporting the provisions of, and widely
disseminating, particularly to the inhabitants of the Non-Self-Governing
Territories, the texts of the Charter of the United Nations, the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples, the Plan of Action for the Full Implementation of the Declaration,
contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 35/118 of
11 December 1980, and all other resolutions and decisions of the United
Nations relating to colonial questions.

(3) The Special Committee also encourages non-governmental
organizations active in the field of decolonization to continue and
intensify their support for all colonial peoples, including those in South
Africa, and for national liberation movements internationally recognized,
in their struggle for freedom, self-determination, national independence
and human rights.

(4) The Special Committee requests the Department of Public
Information of the Secretariat to continue to provide all non-governmental
organizations active in the field of decolonization with clear and simple
information on colonial issues, in the form of relevant United Nations
studies, monographs and other materials about all the Territories under
consideration by the Special Committee, in order to enable them and the
public at large to follow the situation in the colonial Territories. The
provision to non-governmental organizations of information on foreign
economic and military activities in colonial Territories, including
military bases, is of particular importance. The Special Committee
requests the Department for Special Political Questions, Regional
Cooperation, Decolonization and Trusteeship of the Secretariat to continue
preparing material on the subject and to update previous studies.
Non-governmental organizations should be encouraged to assist in
disseminating those materials, in particular to the inhabitants of
Non-Self-Governing Territories.

(5) The Special Committee also requests the Department for Special
Political Questions, Regional Cooperation, Decolonization and Trusteeship
to continue to cooperate with the Institutional Relations and
Non-Governmental Organizations Section and the Public Services Section of
the Department of Public Information and to provide frequent briefings on
decolonization on all the Territories under consideration by the Special
Committee at United Nations Headquarters to interested non-governmental
organizations and student groups, as well as to university students at
campuses away from Headquarters.

(6) The Special Committee and the Department for Special Political
Questions, Regional Cooperation, Decolonization and Trusteeship should be
represented at relevant seminars and other activities on decolonization
matters organized by non-governmental organizations substantially connected
with the mandate and work of the Special Committee in order to disseminate
and explain the position of the United Nations on decolonization issues; to
discuss their experience in disseminating information on decolonization and
in providing assistance to the colonial peoples and their national

-65-



liberation movements; and to obtain additional information on the situation
in the Non-Self-Governing Territories.

(7) The Special Committee, in order to achieve closer cooperation
with the non-governmental organizations active in the field of
decolonization, requests the organizations concerned to supply it with
information on their research and the results thereof with regard to
important points of view on the problems of colonialism, as well as on the
situation in the remaining colonial Territories, and to communicate the
results of that research to it, for distribution to all interested
non-governmental organizations, after consultations in the Special
Committee.

(8) The Department for Special Political Questions, Regional
Cooperation, Decolonization and Trusteeship should be requested to utilize,
whenever appropriate, information furnished by non-governmental
organizations concerning the situation in all the Territories on the agenda
of the Special Committee when preparing working papers for the Special
Committee.

13. The 283rd report of the Subcommittee (A/AC.109/L.1724), adopted by the
Special Committee at its 1364th meeting, on 2 August 1990 (see para. 8),
contained the following conclusions and recommendations:

(1) The Special Committee commends OAU for its contribution to the
complete and speedy eradication of colonialism in all its forms and
manifestations, and of racism and apartheid, for the support it gives to
the colonial peoples and their national liberation movements fighting for
freedom, self-determination, independence and human rights, and for the
attention it devotes to the struggle of independent States in southern
Africa against aggression, subversion, destabilization and all forms of
colonial or neo-colonial pressures by the Pretoria regime.

(2) The Special Committee should further strengthen its contacts,
cooperation, periodic consultations and systematic exchanges of views with
OAU and with the representatives of national liberation movements
recognized by OAU.

(3) The Special Committee recommends that all States, specialized
agencies and non-governmental organizations should be urged once more to
increase their support to the peoples of South Africa struggling for
freedom and human rights.

(4) The Special Committee recommends that a further appeal should be
addressed to all Member States to adopt the measures necessary for the
dissemination of objective and accurate information on the struggle of the
peoples of South Africa against racism and apartheid and for freedom and
human rights. The Special Committee strongly recommends that all Member
States should be asked to report to the Secretary-General on measures
undertaken in response to that appeal.

(5) The Special Committee recommends that the General Assembly should
reiterate the appeal contained in Assembly resolution 2911 (XXVII) of
2 November 1972 regarding voluntary contributions to the OAU Assistance
Fund for the Struggle against Colonialism and Apartheid.

-66-



(6) The Special Committee recommends that the Department of Public
Information, assisted as appropriate by the Department for Special
Political Questions, Regional Cooperation, Decolonization and Trusteeship,
should continue to prepare and disseminate relevant materials and
programmes that reflect the position of the United Nations on the question
of decolonization, and on the struggle against apartheid, particularly
through the United Nations information centres and those non-governmental
organizations active in the field of decolonization on the Special
Committee’s mailing list.

(7) The Special Committee recommends that the Secretary-General,
through the Department of Public Information and the Department for Special
Political Questions, Regional Cooperation, Decolonization and Trusteeship,
should be requested to continue to take all necessary steps to assist, as a
matter of priority, the Special Committee, and the Special Committee
against Apartheid, in order that the United Nations may intensify its
efforts to generate publicity and the dissemination of information on
decolonization with a view to mobilizing public support for the
self-determination, freedom and independence of all colonial peoples.

(8) The Special Committee requests its Chairman to discuss with the
presiding officer of the Special Committee against Apartheid the holding of
periodic consultations in order to coordinate the relevant activities of
the two bodies. Among the matters to be considered in the course of those
consultations should be effective measures to be taken, within the
respective mandates of the two bodies, to intensify the dissemination of
information on decolonization and to seek ways to increase contributions to
the United Nations Educational and Training Programme for Southern Africa
and the United Nations Trust Fund for South Africa.

(9) The Special Committee requests the Secretary-General to expedite
his consultations regarding technical and financial assistance to those
States in southern Africa broadcasting or willing to broadcast
anti-apartheid programmes in order to enable their radio transmitters to be
heard by an increased percentage of the population in South Africa.

14. The 284th report of the Subcommittee (A/AC.109/L.1725), adopted by the
Special Committee at its 1364th meeting, on 2 August 1990 (see para. 8),
contained the recommendation that the Secretary-General should request once more
those States that had not yet done so to reply as speedily as possible to his
previous communications relating to the Plan of Action contained in General
Assembly resolution 35/118. It also contained the recommendation that, taking
into account that the Assembly, by its resolution 43/47 of 22 November 1988, had
declared the period 1990-2000 as the International Decade for the Eradication of
Colonialism, the Secretary-General should submit to the Assembly, at its
forty-fifth session, a report that would enable the Assembly to consider and
adopt an action plan aimed at ushering in, in the twenty-first century, a world
free of colonialism.

15. The Special Committee also took decisions during the year relating to
publicity in connection with other items on its agenda as follows:

(a) In a resolution concerning foreign economic activities in colonial
Territories, adopted at its 1376th meeting, on 20 August (see chap. V, para. 10,
of the present report), the Special Committee, inter alia, requested the
Secretary-General "to undertake, through the Department of Public Information of
the Secretariat, a sustained and broad campaign with a view to informing world

-67-



public opinion of the facts concerning the pillaging of natural resources in
colonial Territories and the exploitation of their indigenous populations by
foreign economic interests";

(b) In a decision on military activities in colonial Territories, adopted
at its 1376th meeting, on 20 August (see chap. VI, para. 10, of the present
report), the Special Committee requested the Secretary-General "to continue,
through the Department of Public Information of the Secretariat, an intensified
campaign of publicity with a view to informing world public opinion of the facts
concerning the military activities and arrangements in colonial Territories
which are impeding the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in General Assembly
resolution 1514 (XV)".

CHAPTER IV*

QUESTION OF SENDING VISITING MISSIONS TO TERRITORIES

A. Consideration by the Special Committee

1. The Special Committee, at its 1362nd meeting, on 22 January 1990, by
adopting the suggestions relating to the organization of its work put forward by
the Chairman (A/AC.109/L.1718), decided to take up the question of sending
visiting missions to Territories as a separate item to be considered at its
plenary meetings and, as appropriate, by its Subcommittee on Small Territories
in connection with its examination of specific Territories.

2. The Special Committee considered the item at its 1365th meeting, on
6 August 1990.

3. In its consideration of the item, the Special Committee took into account
the provisions of the relevant General Assembly resolutions including, in
particular, those provisions relating to the question contained in resolution
44/101 of 11 December 1989 on the implementation of the Declaration on the
Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, and resolutions
44/90 to 44/99 of 11 December 1989 and Assembly decision 44/428 of the same date

respectively, to the twentieth and twenty-fifth anniversaries of the
Declaration.

4. During its consideration of the item, the Special Committee had before it
the report of its Chairman (A/AC.109/L.1741) on his consultations with
representatives of the administering Powers, undertaken in accordance with
paragraph 4 of the resolution adopted by the Committee at its 1349th meeting, on
9 August 1989. 1/ In his report, the Chairman stated, inter alia, that with
regard to the requests addressed to them in the relevant decisions of the
General Assembly and the Special Committee, a number of administering Powers had
reiterated their readiness to continue to provide all relevant information on
the Territories under their respective administration, to participate in the
work of the Committee and to receive visiting missions in the Territories
concerned, as appropriate, and on the basis of consultations to be held
subsequently.

5. The Chairman further stated in his report that, while he had noted the
continued readiness of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland to provide the Special Committee, in accordance with
established practice and procedure, with all relevant information on the
Territories concerned, and stressing the importance of the participation of
administering Powers in the work of the Committee and in multilateral efforts
within the framework of the United Nations for the solution of the remaining
problems of decolonization, he had requested the representative of the United
Kingdom once again to communicate to his Government the appeal by members of the
Committee to reconsider its 1986 decision. In that regard, the Chairman
recalled that the Special Committee had dispatched in the past no fewer than 10
visiting missions to Territories under United Kingdom administration, and
expressed the hope that the Special Committee would receive, in the near future,
invitations from the United Kingdom to send visiting missions to Territories

* Previously issued as part of A/45/23 (Part II).

-69-



under its administration. The Chairman undertook to keep the Special Committee
apprised of any further developments in his consultations with the administering
Powers concerned on that question.

6. At the 1365th meeting, on 6 August, the Chairman drew attention to a draft
resolution on the item which he had prepared on the basis of consultations
(A/AC.109/L.1742).

7. At the same meeting, following a statement by the Chairman
(A/AC.109/PV.1365), the Special Committee adopted the draft resolution
(A/AC.109/L.1742) without objection (see para. 11). The representative of
Norway made a statement (A/AC.109/PV.1365).

8. On 24 August, the text of the resolution (A/AC.109/1046) was transmitted to
the representatives of the administering Powers concerned for the attention of
their respective Governments.

9. In addition to the consideration of the item at the plenary meetings of the
Special Committee, as described below, the Subcommittee on Small Territories, in
considering the specific Territories referred to it, took into account the
relevant provisions of the General Assembly resolutions and decisions mentioned
in paragraph 3, as well as previous decisions of the Committee relating to the
item.

10. By approving the relevant reports of that Subcommittee, the Special
Committee endorsed a number of conclusions and recommendations concerning the
sending of visiting missions to Territories, as reflected in chapter IX of the
present report, relating to Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the
Cayman Islands, Montserrat, St. Helena, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Tokelau,
American Samoa, Guam and the United States Virgin Islands.

B. Decision of the Special Committee

11. The text of the resolution (A/AC.109/1046) adopted by the Special Committee
at its 1365th meeting, on 6 August 1990, to which reference is made in
paragraph 7, is reproduced below:

The Special Committee,

Having considered the question of sending visiting missions to
Territories,

Having examined the report of the Chairman on the question, 2/

Recalling the relevant resolutions and decisions of the General
Assembly and the Special Committee requesting the administering Powers to
cooperate fully with the United Nations by receiving visiting missions in
the Territories under their administration,

Mindful that United Nations visiting missions provide an effective
means of assessing the situation in those Territories and of ascertaining
the wishes and aspirations of the peoples thereof regarding their future
status,

Conscious that United Nations visiting missions enhance the capacity
of the United Nations to assist the peoples of colonial Territories in

-70-



attaining the objectives set forth in the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in General
Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, and in other relevant
resolutions of the Assembly,

Reiterating its regret at the decision in 1986 of the Government of
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland not to take part
in the work of the Special Committee and noting with concern that the
non-participation of the United Kingdom has, since then, made it difficult
for the Special Committee to conduct a thorough review of developments in
the Territories under the administration of the United Kingdom,

1. Stresses the need to dispatch periodic visiting missions to
colonial Territories in order to facilitate the full, speedy and effective
implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to
Colonial Countries and Peoples with respect to those Territories;

2. Calls upon the administering Powers to cooperate or continue to
cooperate with the United Nations by receiving United Nations visiting
missions in the Territories under their administration;

3. Continues to call upon those administering Powers that are not
participating in the work of the Special Committee to reconsider their
decisions and to take an active part in the work of the Committee;

4. Requests its Chairman to continue consultations with the
administering Powers concerned on the implementation of paragraph 2 of the
present resolution and to report thereon to the Special Committee as
appropriate.

independence,

Territories;

have not yet done so to take effective measures against the oil companies
concerned so as to terminate the supply of crude oil and petroleum products

other natural resources of colonial Territories by foreign economic
interests, including the activities of those transnational corporations

CHAPTER VI*

MILITARY ACTIVITIES AND ARRANGEMENTS BY COLONIAL POWERS IN
TERRITORIES UNDER THEIR ADMINISTRATION WHICH MIGHT BE
IMPEDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DECLARATION ON THE
GRANTING OF INDEPENDENCE TO COLONIAL COUNTRIES AND PEOPLES

A. Consideration by the Special Committee

1. The Special Committee, at its 1362nd meeting, on 22 January 1990, by
adopting the suggestions relating to the organization of its work put forward by
the Chairman (A/AC.109/L.1718), decided, inter alia, to take up the above item
as appropriate. The Committee further decided that the item should be
considered at its plenary meetings and, as appropriate, by its Subcommittee on
Small Territories in connection with its examination of specific Territories.

2. The Special Committee considered the item at its 1365th, 1366th and 1376th
meetings, between 6 and 20 August 1990.

3. In its consideration of the item, the Special Committee took into account
the provisions of the relevant General Assembly resolutions, including in
particular resolution 44/101 of 11 December 1989. By paragraph 9 of that
resolution, the Assembly called upon the colonial Powers "to withdraw
immediately and unconditionally their military bases and installations from
colonial Territories, to refrain from establishing new ones and not to involve
those Territories in any offensive acts or interference against other States".
The Committee also took into account Assembly decision 44/425 of
11 December 1989, by paragraph 13 of which the Assembly requested the Committee
"to continue to examine this question and to report thereon to the Assembly at
its forty-fifth session". Further, the Committee took into account the relevant
provisions of Assembly resolution 35/118 of 11 December 1980, the annex to which
contains the Plan of Action for the Full Implementation of the Declaration on
the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, as well as
resolution 40/56 of 2 December 1985 relating to the twenty-fifth anniversary of
the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples.

4. During the consideration of the item, the Special Committee had before it
working papers prepared by the Secretariat containing information on military
activities and arrangements in the following Territories: Guam (A/AC.109/1018),
Bermuda (A/AC.109/1027) and the United States Virgin Islands (A/AC.109/1030).

5. The general debate on the item took place at the 1365th and 1366th
meetings, on 6 and 8 August, respectively. The following Member States took
part in the debate: Afghanistan, China and Czechoslovakia at the 1365th meeting
(A/AC.109/PV.1365); and Cuba, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Chile
at the 1366th meeting (A/AC.109/PV.1366).

6. At the 1366th meeting, on 8 August, statements were made by the Chairman
and the representative of Norway (A/AC.109/PV.1366).

7. At the 1376th meeting, on 20 August, the Chairman drew attention to draft
decision A/AC.109/L.1752 submitted by him on the basis of consultations with
members of the Special Committee.

* Previously issued as part of A/45/23 (Part IV) and Corr.1.

-81-



8. At the same meeting, the Special Committee took action on the draft
decision contained in document A/AC.109/L.1752, as follows:

(a) At the request of Czechoslovakia, a separate vote was taken on
paragraph 7 of the draft decision. Paragraph 7 was retained by a vote of 20 to
2, with 2 abstentions.

(b) The draft decision, as a whole, was adopted by a vote of 22 to none,
with 2 abstentions (see para. 10). The representatives of Czechoslovakia and
Norway made statements (A/AC.109/PV.1376).

9. On 27 August, copies of the decision (A/AC.109/1054) were transmitted to
all States, the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United
Nations system and to the Organization of African Unity (OAU).

B. Decision of the Special Committee

10. The text of the decision (A/AC.109/1054) adopted by the Special Committee
at its 1376th meeting, on 20 August 1990, to which reference is made in
paragraph 8, is reproduced below:

1. The Special Committee, having considered the item entitled "Military
activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their
administration which might be impeding the implementation of the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples" and recalling General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of
14 December 1960 and all other relevant resolutions and decisions of the
United Nations relating to military activities in Non-Self-Governing
Territories, and conscious that military bases and installations in the
Territories concerned could constitute an obstacle to the exercise by the
people of those Territories of their right to self-determination,
reiterates its strong views that existing bases and installations, which
are impeding the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, should be withdrawn and
that no further entrenchment should be condoned.

2. In recalling General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and all other
relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations relating to
military bases and installations in colonial and Non-Self-Governing
Territories, the Special Committee reaffirms its strong conviction that the
presence of military bases and installations in the colonial and Non-Self-
Governing Territories could constitute a major obstacle to the
implementation of the Declaration and that it is the responsibility of the
administering Powers to ensure that the existence of such bases and
installations does not hinder the populations of the Territories from
exercising their right to self-determination and independence in conformity
with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and
the Declaration. Furthermore, aware of the presence of military bases and
installations of the administering Powers concerned and other countries in
those Territories, the Committee urges the administering Powers concerned
to continue to take all necessary measures not to involve those Territories
in any offensive acts or interference against other States and to comply
fully with the purposes and principles of the Charter, the Declaration and
the resolutions and decisions of the United Nations relating to military
activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their
administration.

-82-



3. The Special Committee reiterates its condemnation of all military
activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their
administration that are detrimental to the rights and interests of the
colonial peoples concerned, especially their right to self-determination
and independence. The Committee once again calls upon the colonial Powers
concerned to terminate unconditionally such activities and to eliminate
such military bases in compliance with the relevant resolutions of the
General Assembly, in particular with paragraph 9 of the Plan of Action for
the Full Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence
to Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in the annex to Assembly
resolution 35/118 of 11 December 1980.

4. The Special Committee reiterates that the colonial Territories and
areas adjacent thereto should not be used for nuclear testing, dumping of
nuclear wastes or deployment of nuclear and other weapons of mass
destruction.

5. The Special Committee notes with serious concern that, in southern
Africa in general, a critical situation continues to prevail as a result of
South Africa’s inhuman repression of the people of South Africa. The
Committee declares that the policy of apartheid and destabilization not
only undermines the peace and stability of the southern African region but
also constitutes a threat to international peace and security.

6. The Special Committee condemns the continued military, nuclear and
intelligence collaboration between South Africa and certain countries,
which constitutes a violation of the arms embargo imposed against South
Africa by the Security Council in its resolution 418 (1977) of
4 November 1977, and which poses a threat to international peace and
security. The Special Committee urges the Council to consider, as a matter
of urgency, the report of the Committee established under its resolution
421 (1977) of 9 December 1977 1/ and adopt further measures to widen the
scope of its resolution 418 (1977) in order to make it more effective and
comprehensive. The Special Committee also calls for the scrupulous
observance of Council resolution 558 (1984) of 13 December 1984 enjoining
all States to refrain from importing armaments from South Africa. The
Committee is particularly mindful in that regard of a series of resolutions
adopted by the Security Council, 2/ the General Assembly, the Special
Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples and the Special Committee against Apartheid, as well as the
Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, the Organization of African Unity, the
Commonwealth and a number of intergovernmental and regional organizations.

7. The Special Committee considers that the acquisition of nuclear-weapon
capability by the racist regime of South Africa, with its infamous record
of violence and aggression, constitutes a further effort on its part to
terrorize and intimidate independent States in the region into submission
while also posing a threat to all mankind. The Committee condemns the
continuing support to the racist regime of South Africa in the military and
nuclear fields. In this context, the Committee expresses its concern at
the grave consequences for international peace and security of the
collaboration between the racist regime of South Africa and certain Western
Powers, Israel and other countries in the military and nuclear fields. It
calls upon the States concerned to end all such collaboration and, in
particular, to halt the supply to South Africa of equipment, technology,

-83-



nuclear materials and related training, which increases its nuclear
capability.

8. The Special Committee strongly condemns the continuing collaboration
of certain countries with the racist regime in the military and nuclear
fields and expresses its conviction that such collaboration is in
contravention of the arms embargo imposed against South Africa under
Security Council resolution 418 (1977) and undermines international
solidarity against the apartheid regime. The Committee thus calls for the
termination forthwith of all such collaboration.

9. The Special Committee urges all Governments, the specialized agencies
and other intergovernmental organizations to provide increased material
assistance to the thousands of refugees who have been forced by the
apartheid regime’s oppressive policies in South Africa to flee into the
neighbouring States and for the purpose of resettlement of those who are
returning.

10. The Special Committee deprecates the continued alienation of land in
colonial Territories for military installations. The large-scale
utilization of local economic and manpower resources for this purpose
diverts resources that could be more beneficially utilized in promoting the
economic development of the Territories concerned and is thus contrary to
the interests of their populations.

11. The Special Committee requests the Secretary-General to continue,
through the Department of Public Information of the Secretariat, an
intensified campaign of publicity with a view to informing world public
opinion of the facts concerning the military activities and arrangements in
colonial Territories which are impeding the implementation of the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples, contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV).

12. The Special Committee decides, subject to any directives that the
General Assembly may give in this connection at its forty-fifth session, to
continue to consider the item at its next session.

C. Recommendation of the Special Committee

11. In accordance with decisions taken at its 1362nd and 1363rd meetings, on
22 January and 1 August 1990, respectively, the Special Committee recommends to
the General Assembly the adoption of the following draft decision:

Military activities and arrangements by colonial
Powers in Territories under their administration
which might be impeding the implementation of the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to

Colonial Countries and Peoples

1. The General Assembly, having considered the chapter of the report of
the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of
the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples relating to an item on the agenda of the Special Committee entitled
"Military activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories
under their administration which might be impeding the implementation of

-84-



the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples" 3/ and recalling its resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 and
all other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations relating
to military activities in Non-Self-Governing Territories, and conscious
that military bases and installations in the Territories concerned could
constitute an obstacle to the exercise by the people of those Territories
of their right to self-determination, reiterates its strong views that
existing bases and installations, which are impeding the implementation of
the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples, should be withdrawn and that no further entrenchment should be
condoned.

2. In recalling its resolution 1514 (XV) and all other relevant
resolutions and decisions of the United Nations relating to military bases
and installations in colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories, the
General Assembly reaffirms its strong conviction that the presence of
military bases and installations in the colonial and Non-Self-Governing
Territories could constitute a major obstacle to the implementation of the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples and that it is the responsibility of the administering Powers to
ensure that the existence of such bases and installations does not hinder
the populations of the Territories from exercising their right to self-
determination and independence in conformity with the purposes and
principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration.
Furthermore, aware of the presence of military bases and installations of
the administering Powers concerned and other countries in those
Territories, the Assembly urges the administering Powers concerned to
continue to take all necessary measures not to involve those Territories in
any offensive acts or interference against other States and to comply fully
with the purposes and principles of the Charter, the Declaration and the
resolutions and decisions of the United Nations relating to military
activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their
administration.

3. The General Assembly reiterates its condemnation of all military
activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their
administration that are detrimental to the rights and interests of the
colonial peoples concerned, especially their right to self-determination
and independence. The Assembly once again calls upon the colonial Powers
concerned to terminate unconditionally such activities and to eliminate
such military bases in compliance with the relevant resolutions of the
Assembly, in particular with paragraph 9 of the Plan of Action for the Full
Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to
Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in the annex to Assembly
resolution 35/118 of 11 December 1980.

4. The General Assembly reiterates that the colonial Territories and
areas adjacent thereto should not be used for nuclear testing, dumping of
nuclear wastes or deployment of nuclear and other weapons of mass
destruction.

5. The General Assembly notes with serious concern that, in southern
Africa in general, a critical situation continues to prevail as a result of
South Africa’s inhuman repression of the people of South Africa. The
Assembly declares that the policy of apartheid and destabilization not only
undermines the peace and stability of the southern African region but also
constitutes a threat to international peace and security.

-85-



6. The General Assembly condemns the continued military, nuclear and
intelligence collaboration between South Africa and certain countries,
which constitutes a violation of the arms embargo imposed against South
Africa by the Security Council in its resolution 418 (1977) of
4 November 1977, and which poses a threat to international peace and
security. The Assembly urges the Security Council to consider, as a matter
of urgency, the report of the Committee established under its resolution
421 (1977) of 9 December 1977 1/ and adopt further measures to widen the
scope of its resolution 418 (1977) in order to make it more effective and
comprehensive. The Assembly also calls for the scrupulous observance of
Security Council resolution 558 (1984) of 13 December 1984 enjoining all
States to refrain from importing armaments from South Africa. The Assembly
is particularly mindful in that regard of a series of resolutions adopted
by the Security Council, 2/ the General Assembly, the Special Committee on
the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the
Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, and the Special
Committee against Apartheid, as well as the Movement of Non-Aligned
Countries, the Organization of African Unity, the Commonwealth and a number
of intergovernmental and regional organizations.

7. The General Assembly considers that the acquisition of nuclear-weapon
capability by the racist regime of South Africa, with its infamous record
of violence and aggression, constitutes a further effort on its part to
terrorize and intimidate independent States in the region into submission
while also posing a threat to all mankind. The Assembly condemns the
continuing support to the racist regime of South Africa in the military and
nuclear fields. In this context, the Assembly expresses its concern at the
grave consequences for international peace and security of the
collaboration between the racist regime of South Africa and certain Western
Powers, Israel and other countries in the military and nuclear fields. It
calls upon the States concerned to end all such collaboration and, in
particular, to halt the supply to South Africa of equipment, technology,
nuclear materials and related training, which increases its nuclear
capability.

8. The General Assembly strongly condemns the continuing collaboration of
certain countries with the racist regime in the military and nuclear fields
and expresses its conviction that such collaboration is in contravention of
the arms embargo imposed against South Africa under Security Council
resolution 418 (1977) and undermines international solidarity against the
apartheid regime. The Committee thus calls for the termination forthwith
of all such collaboration.

9. The General Assembly urges all Governments, the specialized agencies
and other intergovernmental organizations to provide increased material
assistance to the thousands of refugees who have been forced by the
apartheid regime’s oppressive policies in South Africa to flee into the
neighbouring States and for the purpose of resettlement of those who are
returning.

10. The General Assembly deprecates the continued alienation of land in
colonial Territories for military installations. The large-scale
utilization of local economic and manpower resources for this purpose
diverts resources that could be more beneficially utilized in promoting the
economic development of the Territories concerned and is thus contrary to
the interests of their populations.

-86-



11. The General Assembly requests the Secretary-General to continue,
through the Department of Public Information of the Secretariat, an
intensified campaign of publicity with a view to informing world public
opinion of the facts concerning the military activities and arrangements in
colonial Territories which are impeding the implementation of the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples, contained in Assembly resolution 1514 (XV).

12. The General Assembly requests the Special Committee on the Situation
with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples to continue to examine this
question and to report thereon to the Assembly at its forty-sixth session.

Southern Africa,

Bearing in mind the relevant provisions of the final documents of the
successive Conferences of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned
Countries and of the resolutions adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State
and Government of the Organization of African Unity,

Noting with satisfaction the attainment of independence by Namibia
following the holding of free and fair elections under the supervision and
control of the United Nations, and the subsequent admission of independent
Namibia as a Member of the United Nations on 23 April 1990,

Noting that the large majority of the remaining Non-Self-Governing
Territories are small island Territories,

Recalling relevant resolutions of the Caribbean Development and
Cooperation Committee concerning the access of Non-Self-Governing
Territories to programmes and activities of the United Nations system,

Noting the assistance extended thus far to colonial Territories by
certain specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations
system, in particular the United Nations Development Programme, and
considering that such assistance should be expanded further, commensurate
with the pressing needs of the peoples concerned for external assistance,

Stressing the importance of securing additional resources for funding
expanding programmes of assistance for the peoples concerned and the need
to enlist the support of the major funding institutions within the United
Nations system in that regard,

Noting with deep concern that destabilization by South Africa of the
front-line and neighbouring States, whether through direct aggression,
sponsorship of surrogates, economic subversion or other means, the forms
and consequences of which stand well documented in United Nations and other
publications, is unacceptable in all its forms and must not occur,

Reaffirming the responsibility of the specialized agencies and other
organizations of the United Nations system to take all the necessary
measures, within their respective spheres of competence, to ensure the full
and speedy implementation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and
other relevant resolutions of the United Nations, particularly those
relating to the extension of assistance to the peoples of the colonial
Territories,

Expressing its appreciation to the General Secretariat of the
Organization of African Unity for the continued cooperation and assistance
it has extended to the specialized agencies and other organizations of the
United Nations system in connection with the implementation of the relevant
resolutions of the United Nations, and convinced that closer contacts and
consultations between the specialized agencies and other organizations of

-91-



the United Nations system and regional organizations help to facilitate the
effective formulation of assistance programmes to the peoples concerned,

Noting with grave concern the extensive links and collaboration
between the apartheid regime of South Africa and certain countries in the
political, diplomatic, economic, nuclear, military and other fields, and
the growing military and nuclear cooperation between racist Pretoria and
Israel,

Bearing in mind the importance of the activities of non-governmental
organizations aimed at putting an end to the assistance which is still
being rendered to South Africa by some specialized agencies,

Mindful of the imperative need to keep under continuous review the
activities of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the
United Nations system in the implementation of the various United Nations
decisions relating to decolonization,

Bearing in mind the extremely fragile economies of the small island
Territories and their vulnerability to natural disasters, such as
hurricanes and cyclones, and recalling relevant resolutions of the General
Assembly,

by the relevant resolutions of the United Nations in their efforts to
contribute, within their spheres of competence, to the full and speedy
implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to
Colonial Countries and Peoples;

4. Reaffirms also that the recognition by the General Assembly, the
Security Council and other United Nations organs of the legitimacy of the
struggle of colonial peoples to exercise their right to self-determination
and independence entails, as a corollary, the extension by the specialized
agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system of all the
necessary moral and material assistance to those peoples and their national
liberation movements;

5. Expresses its appreciation to those specialized agencies and
other organizations of the United Nations system that have continued to
cooperate in varying degrees with the United Nations and the Organization
of African Unity in the implementation of General Assembly resolution
1514 (XV) and other relevant resolutions of the United Nations, and urges
all the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations
system to accelerate the full and speedy implementation of the relevant
provisions of those resolutions;

6. Requests the specialized agencies and other organizations of the
United Nations system to render or continue to render, as a matter of

-92-



urgency, all possible moral and material assistance to the colonial
peoples, bearing in mind that such assistance should not only meet their
immediate needs, but also create conditions for development after they have
exercised their right to self-determination and independence;

7. Requests once again the specialized agencies and other
organizations of the United Nations system to continue to provide all
humanitarian, material and moral assistance to Namibia and all newly
independent and emerging States so as to enable them to achieve genuine
economic independence;

8. Reiterates its recommendation that the specialized agencies and
other organizations of the United Nations system should initiate or broaden
contacts and cooperation with the colonial peoples and the administering

facilitate and to accelerate the implementation of General Assembly
resolution 1514 (XV);

governing and legislative organs concrete proposals for the full
implementation of the relevant United Nations decisions, particularly
specific programmes of assistance to the peoples of the colonial
Territories and their national liberation movements;

10. Urges once again the executive heads of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund to draw the attention of their governing bodies
to the present resolution and urges them to introduce flexible procedures
to prepare specific programmes for the peoples of the colonial Territories;

11. Urges the specialized agencies and other organizations of the
United Nations system that have not already done so to include in the
agenda of the regular meetings of their governing bodies a separate item on
the progress they have made in the implementation of General Assembly
resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant resolutions of the United Nations;

12. Also requests the specialized agencies and other organizations of
the United Nations system, as well as international and regional
organizations, to take appropriate measures within their respective spheres
of competence in order to accelerate progress in the economic and social
sectors of those Territories;

13. Welcomes the continued initiative exercised by the United Nations
Development Programme in maintaining close liaison among the specialized
agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, and in
coordinating the activities of the agencies in extending effective
assistance to the peoples of colonial Territories, and calls upon the
specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system,
as a matter of urgency, to contribute generously to the relief,
rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts in those Non-Self-Governing
Territories affected by natural disasters;

14. Urges the administering Powers concerned to facilitate the
participation of the representatives of the Governments of Trust and
Non-Self-Governing Territories at the relevant meetings and conferences of

-93-



the agencies and organizations so that the Territories may draw the maximum
benefits from the related activities of the specialized agencies and other
organizations of the United Nations system;

15. Further urges the specialized agencies and other organizations of
the United Nations system to adhere to the Programme of Action contained in
the Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive Consequences in Southern
Africa, in particular with regard to increased support for the opponents of
apartheid, the use of concerted and effective measures aimed at applying
pressure to ensure a speedy end to apartheid and ensuring the
non-relaxation of existing measures to encourage the South African regime
to eradicate apartheid until there is clear evidence of profound and
irreversible changes;

16. Stresses, in the context of the Declaration on Apartheid and its
Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa, the need for the specialized
agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system to render all
possible assistance to the front-line and neighbouring States to enable
them to rebuild their economies, which have been adversely affected by
South Africa’s acts of aggression and destabilization, to withstand any
further such acts and to continue to support the people of South Africa;

17. Invites the specialized agencies and other organizations of the
United Nations system to cooperate with the Action for Resisting Invasion,
Colonialism and Apartheid Fund set up by the Eighth Conference of Heads of
State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Harare from 1 to
6 September 1986, in the common objective of providing emergency assistance
to the front-line States and national liberation movements struggling
against the apartheid regime;

18. Condemns the extensive links and collaboration between the
apartheid regime of South Africa and certain countries in the political,
diplomatic, economic, nuclear, military and other fields, and the growing
military and nuclear cooperation between the racist regime and Israel;

19. Recommends that all Governments should intensify their efforts in
the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations
system of which they are members to ensure the full and effective
implementation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant
resolutions of the United Nations and, in that connection, should accord
priority to the question of providing assistance on an emergency basis to
the peoples of the colonial Territories;

20. Requests the Secretary-General to continue to assist the
specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system
in working out appropriate measures for implementing the relevant
resolutions of the United Nations and to prepare for submission to the
relevant bodies, with the assistance of those agencies and organizations, a
report on the action taken in implementation of the relevant resolutions,
including the present resolution, since the circulation of his previous
report;

21. Requests the Economic and Social Council to continue, as
appropriate, to consider, in consultation with the Special Committee on the
Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the
Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, appropriate
measures for coordination of the policies and activities of the specialized

-94-



agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system in

Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting
of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples
by the specialized agencies and the international
institutions associated with the United Nations

The General Assembly,

Having examined the item entitled "Implementation of the Declaration
on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the
specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the
United Nations",

Having considered the reports submitted on the item by the Secretary-

-95-



Noting that the large majority of the remaining Non-Self-Governing
Territories are small island Territories,

Noting the assistance extended thus far to colonial Territories by
certain specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations
system, in particular the United Nations Development Programme, and
considering that such assistance should be expanded further, commensurate
with the pressing needs of the peoples concerned for external assistance,

Stressing the importance of securing additional resources for funding
expanding programmes of assistance for the peoples concerned and the need
to enlist the support of the major funding institutions within the United
Nations system in that regard,

Noting with deep concern that destabilization by South Africa of the
front-line and neighbouring States, whether through direct aggression,
sponsorship of surrogates, economic subversion or other means, the forms
and consequences of which stand well documented in United Nations and other
publications, is unacceptable in all its forms and must not occur,

Reaffirming the responsibility of the specialized agencies and other
organizations of the United Nations system to take all the necessary
measures, within their respective spheres of competence, to ensure the full
and speedy implementation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and
other relevant resolutions of the United Nations, particularly those
relating to the extension of assistance to the peoples of the colonial
Territories,

Expressing its appreciation to the General Secretariat of the
Organization of African Unity for the continued cooperation and assistance
it has extended to the specialized agencies and other organizations of the

resolutions of the United Nations, and convinced that closer contacts and
consultations between the specialized agencies and other organizations of

effective formulation of assistance programmes to the peoples concerned,

Noting with grave concern the extensive links and collaboration
between the apartheid regime of South Africa and certain countries in the
political, diplomatic, economic, nuclear, military and other fields, and
the growing military and nuclear cooperation between racist Pretoria and
Israel,

Bearing in mind the importance of the activities of non-governmental
organizations aimed at putting an end to the assistance which is still
being rendered to South Africa by some specialized agencies,

Mindful of the imperative need to keep under continuous review the
activities of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the
United Nations system in the implementation of the various United Nations
decisions relating to decolonization,

Colonial Countries and Peoples;

3. Reaffirms also that the recognition by the General Assembly, the
Security Council and other United Nations organs of the legitimacy of the
struggle of colonial peoples to exercise their right to self-determination
and independence entails, as a corollary, the extension by the specialized
agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system of all the
necessary moral and material assistance to those peoples and their national
liberation movements;

4. Expresses its appreciation to those specialized agencies and
other organizations of the United Nations system that have continued to
cooperate in varying degrees with the United Nations and the Organization
of African Unity in the implementation of General Assembly resolution
1514 (XV) and other relevant resolutions of the United Nations, and urges
all the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations
system to accelerate the full and speedy implementation of the relevant
provisions of those resolutions;

5. Requests the specialized agencies and other organizations of the
United Nations system to render or continue to render, as a matter of

exercised their right to self-determination and independence;

6. Requests once again the specialized agencies and other
organizations of the United Nations system to continue to provide all
humanitarian, material and moral assistance to Namibia and all newly
independent and emerging States so as to enable them to achieve genuine

other organizations of the United Nations system should initiate or broaden
contacts and cooperation with the colonial peoples and the administering
Powers concerned, directly or, where appropriate, through regional
organizations, in order to intensify programmes of assistance, to
facilitate and to accelerate the implementation of General Assembly
resolution 1514 (XV);

to prepare specific programmes for the peoples of the colonial Territories;

10. Urges the specialized agencies and other organizations of the
United Nations system that have not already done so to include in the
agenda of the regular meetings of their governing bodies a separate item on
the progress they have made in the implementation of General Assembly
resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant resolutions of the United Nations;

11. Also requests the specialized agencies and other organizations of
the United Nations system, as well as international and regional
organizations, to take appropriate measures within their respective spheres
of competence in order to accelerate progress in the economic and social
sectors of those Territories;

12. Welcomes the continued initiative exercised by the United Nations
Development Programme in maintaining close liaison among the specialized
agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, and in
coordinating the activities of the agencies in extending effective

specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system,
as a matter of urgency, to contribute generously to the relief,
rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts in those Non-Self-Governing
Territories affected by natural disasters;

13. Urges the administering Powers concerned to facilitate the
participation of the representatives of the Governments of Trust and
Non-Self-Governing Territories at the relevant meetings and conferences of
the agencies and organizations so that the Territories may draw the maximum
benefits from the related activities of the specialized agencies and other
organizations of the United Nations system;

14. Further urges the specialized agencies and other organizations of
the United Nations system to adhere to the Programme of Action contained in
the Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive Consequences in Southern
Africa, in particular with regard to increased support for the opponents of
apartheid, the use of concerted and effective measures aimed at applying
pressure to ensure a speedy end to apartheid and ensuring the

to eradicate apartheid until there is clear evidence of profound and
irreversible changes;

15. Stresses, in the context of the Declaration on Apartheid and its
Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa, the need for the specialized
agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system to render all
possible assistance to the front-line and neighbouring States to enable
them to rebuild their economies, which have been adversely affected by
South Africa’s acts of aggression and destabilization, to withstand any
further such acts and to continue to support the people of South Africa;

-98-



16. Invites the specialized agencies and other organizations of the
United Nations system to cooperate with the Action for Resisting Invasion,

6 September 1986, in the common objective of providing emergency assistance
to the front-line States and national liberation movements struggling
against the apartheid regime;

17. Condemns the extensive links and collaboration between the
apartheid regime of South Africa and certain countries in the political,
diplomatic, economic, nuclear, military and other fields, and the growing
military and nuclear cooperation between the racist regime and Israel;

18. Recommends that all Governments should intensify their efforts in
the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations
system of which they are members to ensure the full and effective

priority to the question of providing assistance on an emergency basis to
the peoples of the colonial Territories;

19. Requests the Secretary-General to continue to assist the
specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system

Annex

TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-FIRST REPORT OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE
ON PETITIONS, INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE*

Chairman: Mr. Alexander SLABÝ (Czechoslovakia)

...

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

(1) The Special Committee condemns the extensive links and collaboration
between the apartheid regime of South Africa and certain Western countries, and
especially Israel, in the political, diplomatic, economic, nuclear, military and
other fields.

(2) The Special Committee recognizes the important role of the front-line
States in the liberation struggle in southern Africa and urges the specialized
agencies and other organizations and institutions of the United Nations system
to extend within their competence, as a matter of priority, substantial material
and other assistance to the front-line States in order to enable them to support
more effectively the liberation struggle in southern Africa and to resist the
violation of their sovereignty and territorial integrity by troops of the racist
regime of South Africa.

(3) The Special Committee reiterates its firm position that the
specialized agencies and other organizations and institutions of the United
Nations system should continue to be guided by the relevant resolutions and
decisions of the United Nations in their efforts to contribute, within their
spheres of competence, to the full and speedy implementation of the Declaration
on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in
General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960.

(4) The Special Committee commends those specialized agencies and other
organizations and institutions of the United Nations system that have continued
to cooperate with the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
in the implementation of the Declaration and the other relevant resolutions and
decisions of the United Nations, and urges all the specialized agencies and
other organizations and institutions of the United Nations system to accelerate
the full and speedy implementation of the relevant provisions of those
resolutions. The Special Committee urges those who have not already done so to
include in the agenda of the regular meetings of their governing bodies a
separate item on the progress they have made in the implementation of the
Declaration and the other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United
Nations, particularly on the assistance provided to colonial peoples and their
national liberation movements.

(5) Once again, the Special Committee recommends that the attention of all
specialized agencies and other organizations and institutions of the United
Nations system should be drawn to the principle that recognition by the General
Assembly, the Security Council and other United Nations organs of the legitimacy
of the struggle of colonial peoples to exercise their right to self-
determination and independence entails, as a corollary, the increase by the

-100-



United Nations system of its moral and material assistance to the peoples of the
colonial Territories, including those of South Africa, their national liberation
movements and other internationally recognized liberation movements.

(6) The Special Committee continues to urge the specialized agencies and
other organizations and institutions of the United Nations system to render or
to continue to render, as a matter of urgency, all possible moral and material
assistance to the colonial peoples struggling for their liberation. In this
connection, the Special Committee is of the opinion that all organizations
concerned should initiate, in the case of those that have not yet done so, or
broaden contacts and cooperation with those peoples and their national
liberation movements directly or, where appropriate, through the relevant
international bodies, and should work out and implement concrete programmes of
assistance for those peoples with the active cooperation of their national
liberation movements. The Special Committee is of the view that the assistance
provided by the specialized agencies and other organizations and institutions of
the United Nations system to the peoples of the colonial Territories, including
those of South Africa, and their liberation movements and other internationally
recognized liberation movements, should not only meet their immediate needs, but
should also create conditions conducive to development after these peoples have
exercised their right to self-determination and independence, taking into
consideration the need to preserve indigenous cultures and traditions, as well
as the benefits they may provide for development.

(7) The Special Committee urges the specialized agencies and other
organizations and institutions of the United Nations system to assist in
accelerating progress in all sectors of the national life of the small
Territories, particularly in the development of their economies.

(8) The Special Committee commends the arrangements made by several
specialized agencies and other organizations and institutions of the United
Nations system that enable representatives of the national liberation movements
recognized by OAU and by the United Nations to participate fully as observers in
the proceedings of those organizations relating to matters concerning their
countries and calls upon those agencies and organizations that have not yet done
so to follow this example and to make the necessary arrangements without delay.

(9) The Special Committee notes with satisfaction that the Namibian people
continue to be the beneficiaries of a number of programmes established within
the framework of the United Nations Fund for Namibia and the United Nations
Educational and Training Programme for Southern Africa.

(10) The Special Committee emphasizes the importance of coordination at the
country, regional and Headquarters levels of the programmes of assistance
provided by the specialized agencies and other organizations and institutions of
the United Nations system to the colonial peoples and their national liberation
movements, including those of South Africa and other internationally recognized
liberation movements. The Special Committee considers that such coordination
would enable the peoples concerned to derive the maximum benefit from those
programmes.

(11) The Special Committee takes note of the fact that some influential
groups are encouraging the granting of a new loan to South Africa by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and, in this context, urges IMF to comply
strictly with the relevant United Nations resolutions regarding South Africa and
its apartheid policies.

-101-



(12) The Special Committee takes note of the statement made by the
representative of the World Bank before the Subcommittee on 18 April 1990, in
which he indicated that South Africa was a member of the Bank, but that the Bank
had not granted any loans to South Africa since 1966 and that all loans made to,
or guaranteed by, South Africa up to that time had been fully repaid.
Therefore, the Bank did not have any outstanding loans to South Africa. Also,
the last election for executive directors of the Bank Group in which South
Africa had participated had been the one held in 1972; as a result, it was not
represented on the Board of Executive Directors of the Bank, the International
Development Association (IDA) or the International Finance Corporation (IFC).
The Special Committee notes with deep concern that the World Bank continues to
maintain certain financial and technical links with racist South Africa, as
exemplified by the continued participation of South Africa in the work of that
body, and is of the view that the World Bank should put an end to all links with
that racist regime, as long as apartheid continues to exist.

(13) The Special Committee reiterates its firm conviction that, in
accordance with the relevant resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly
and the Security Council, all specialized agencies and other organizations and
institutions of the United Nations system should take all the measures necessary
to stop all collaboration with or assistance to the racist regime of South
Africa in financial, economic, technical, nuclear or other fields so as to
compel that regime to implement the resolutions and decisions of the United
Nations concerning the apartheid regime and neighbouring States. The Special
Committee is also of the view that these organizations should discontinue all
collaboration with and support to that regime until apartheid has been
eradicated and a non-racial, united and democratic State based on the will of
all South African people has been established in accordance with the relevant
resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. The
Special Committee commends all those agencies and organizations that have
terminated relations with the racist South African regime and recommends that
the General Assembly should hold accountable those agencies and organizations
that continue to cooperate with, and extend such assistance to, South Africa.

(14) The Special Committee deeply deplores the granting, in disregard of
relevant resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly, of a credit of
$US 1.1 billion by IMF to South Africa in November 1982. The Special Committee
takes note of the statement made by the representative of IMF on 20 April 1990,
in which he said that South Africa had paid back to the Fund all the amounts it
had borrowed, along with interest charges. The Special Committee is strongly
convinced that the total economic isolation of the apartheid system implies a
serious instability in the South African economy. In this connection the
Special Committee deeply regrets that IMF continues to maintain links with the
racist South African regime, and it is of the view that IMF should put an end to
all links with that racist regime and should not extend any credits or any kind
of assistance to South Africa as long as apartheid continues to exist.

(15) The Special Committee therefore recommends that the General Assembly,
at its forty-fifth session, should once again propose, under article III of the
Agreement between the United Nations and IMF, a/ the urgent inclusion in the
agenda of the Board of Governors of the Fund of an item dealing with the
relationship between the Fund and South Africa. It further recommends that, in
pursuance of article II of the Agreement, the General Assembly should propose
that the relevant organs of the United Nations should participate in any meeting
of the Board of Governors called by the Fund for the purpose of discussing the
above-mentioned item.

-102-



(16) The Special Committee urges IMF and the World Bank to increase their
assistance to the front-line and neighbouring States that have been victims of
South African aggression.

(17) The Special Committee reiterates its conviction that consultations
with the specialized agencies and other organizations and institutions of the
United Nations system are an appropriate means for further strengthening the
role of those organizations in the process of decolonization with regard to the
aims and objectives of the Declaration, as well as for the Special Committee to
benefit from their experience in that process. The Special Committee is also of
the opinion that the agencies and organizations, particularly IMF, in accordance
with their charters, should inform it of the results of the consideration by
their respective bodies of the appeals addressed to them in the relevant
resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly aimed at enhancing their role
in the decolonization process.

the provisions of relevant General Assembly resolutions, including in particular
resolution 44/101 of 11 December 1989 on the implementation of the Declaration
on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. By

continue to seek suitable means for the immediate and full implementation of

* Previously issued under the symbol A/45/23 (Part VI) and Corr.1.

-108-



General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) in all Territories that have not yet
attained independence and, in particular, "... to formulate specific proposals
for the elimination of the remaining manifestations of colonialism and to report
thereon to the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session". The Committee also
took into account Assembly resolutions 44/88 to 44/99 of 11 December 1989 and
decisions 44/402 of 22 September 1989, and 44/426 to 44/428 of 11 December 1989
relating to the items. Further, the Committee took into account the relevant
provisions of Assembly resolution 35/118 of 11 December 1980, the annex to which
contains the Plan of Action for the Full Implementation of the Declaration, as
well as Assembly resolution 40/56 of 2 December 1985 relating to the
twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration.

4. In their capacity as the administering Powers concerned and in accordance
with established procedures, the delegations of New Zealand, Portugal and the
United States of America continued to participate in the work of the Special
Committee, New Zealand in relation to Tokelau, Portugal to East Timor and the
United States to American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands and Guam. The
latter delegation did not take part in the Committee’s consideration of the
Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.

5. The delegation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
the administering Power concerned, did not participate in the Special
Committee’s consideration of the Territories under its administration. 1/

6. In its reports on the Territories under United Kingdom administration, the
Subcommittee on Small Territories, recalling that it had been the established
procedure for the administering Power to participate in the consideration of the
Territory under its administration and bearing in mind the relevant provisions
of the General Assembly resolutions, particularly those that had invited all
States to cooperate fully with the Special Committee in the fulfilment of its
mandate, expressed its regret at the non-participation of the United Kingdom and
the negative impact that that had on its work. In that regard, the Subcommittee
stressed the importance of multilateral efforts within the framework of the
United Nations for the solution of the remaining problems of decolonization. It
reiterated its appeal to the administering Power to reconsider its decision and
to resume its participation in the work of the Special Committee, and called
upon the administering Power to provide detailed and up-to-date information
under Article 73 e of the Charter of the United Nations.

7. In a related context, the Special Committee, at its 1365th meeting, on
6 August, adopted a resolution on the question of sending visiting missions to
Territories (A/AC.109/1046), by which, in "reiterating its regret at the
decision in 1986 of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland not to take part in the work of the Special Committee and
noting with concern that the non-participation of the United Kingdom has, since
then, made it difficult for the Special Committee to conduct a thorough review
of developments in the Territories under the administration of the United
Kingdom", the Committee called upon the administering Powers "to cooperate or
continue to cooperate with the United Nations by receiving United Nations
visiting missions in the Territories under their administration", and upon those
administering Powers that were not participating in the work of the Special
Committee "to reconsider their decisions and to take an active part in the work
of the Committee". 2/

report of the Subcommittee on Small Territories and endorsed the conclusions and
recommendations contained therein. The text of the conclusions and
recommendations is reproduced below (see also para. 114, draft resolution II):

(1) The Special Committee reaffirms the inalienable right of the
people of Anguilla to self-determination and independence in conformity
with the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries
and Peoples, contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of
14 December 1960.

(2) The Special Committee reiterates the view that such factors as
territorial size, geographical location, size of population and limited
natural resources should in no way delay the speedy exercise by the people
of Anguilla of their inalienable right to self-determination and
independence in conformity with the Declaration contained in General
Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), which fully applies to the Territory.

(3) The Special Committee also reiterates that it is the
responsibility of the administering Power to create such conditions in the
Territory as will enable the people of Anguilla to exercise freely and
without interference their inalienable right to self-determination and
independence in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), as
well as all other relevant resolutions of the Assembly.

-114-



(4) The Special Committee reaffirms that it is ultimately for the
people of Anguilla themselves to determine freely their future political
status. In this connection, the Committee reaffirms the importance of
fostering an awareness among the people of the Territory of the
possibilities open to them in the exercise of their right to
self-determination and independence in accordance with the principles of
the Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration.

(5) The Special Committee notes that the Government of the United
Kingdom has agreed to several of the changes recommended by the Anguilla
House of Assembly, based on the report of the Constitution Review
Committee, which was appointed in 1985 to consider constitutional changes.
The Committee notes, however, that the administering Power has not changed
its position regarding the restriction or delegation to ministers of the
territorial Government, of any or all of the Governor’s special
responsibilities without setting a time-frame for independence.

(6) The Special Committee notes that the changes agreed upon have
been referred to the legal advisers of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office,
who were instructed to begin work on the amendments with a view to
implementing them in early 1990, and that in January 1990 a government
delegation visited London to discuss with officials of the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office the amendments to the Constitution.

(7) The Special Committee notes the results of the general elections
of 29 February 1989 and the statement of the Chief Minister that the
Government of Anguilla had no intention of moving towards independence
during its current term of office.

(8) The Special Committee reaffirms the responsibility of the
administering Power to promote the economic and social development of
Anguilla and calls upon the administering Power to continue, in cooperation
with the territorial Government, to strengthen the economy and to increase
its assistance to programmes of diversification.

(9) The Special Committee urges the administering Power, in
cooperation with the territorial Government, to take effective measures to
safeguard and guarantee the inalienable right of the people of Anguilla to
own and dispose of the natural resources of the Territory, including marine
resources, and to establish and maintain control over the future
development of those resources. In this connection, the Committee takes
note of reports of the possible sale of one of Anguilla’s offshore islands
to an international group of bankers and agrees to keep the situation under
review.

(10) The Special Committee calls upon the specialized agencies and
other organizations of the United Nations system to continue to take all
necessary measures to accelerate progress in the social and economic life
of the Territory. In this respect, the Committee notes with appreciation
the continued contribution of the United Nations Development Programme, as
well as regional institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, to
the development of the Territory.

(11) The Special Committee notes that the Territory was considering
undertaking a comprehensive review of current banking, companies, insurance
and trust legislation and expresses the hope that such a review would
facilitate efforts to combat effectively the problem of money laundering in

-115-



the Territory. It further notes that the Territory became a member of the
Eastern Caribbean Central Bank in 1987.

(12) The Special Committee once again expresses its concern over the
continued illegal operations of foreign fishing vessels within the
territorial waters and the offshore fishing banks. The Committee stresses
that this uncontrolled exploitation could deplete current fish stocks and
adversely affect future yields. The Committee welcomes the measures taken
by the Government and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States designed
to protect and conserve the Territory’s marine resources and to control the
activities of illegal foreign fishermen in the area.

(13) The Special Committee notes the continued participation of the
Territory in the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development
and in the activities of the Caribbean Development and Cooperation
Committee, a subsidiary body of the Economic Commission for Latin America
and the Caribbean. In this connection, the Committee reiterates the
recommendation of the Visiting Mission in 1984, that the administering
Power should continue to make every effort to facilitate and encourage the
participation of representatives of the Territory in regional and
international organizations.

(14) The Special Committee notes the importance that the territorial
Government attaches to an efficient and effective civil service and urges
the administering Power to continue, in cooperation with the territorial
Government, the assistance necessary for increased employment of the local
population in the civil service, as well as in managerial, technical and
other sectors of the economy.

(15) The Special Committee notes with concern the vulnerability of the
Territory to drug trafficking and money-laundering activities and, in that
connection, calls upon the administering Power to continue to take all
necessary measures, in cooperation with the territorial Government, to
combat the drug problem in all its aspects within the Territory.

(16) The Special Committee, recalling that a United Nations mission
visited the Territory in 1984 and bearing in mind that visiting missions
provide an effective means of assessing the situation in the
Non-Self-Governing Territories, considers that the possibility of sending a
further visiting mission to Anguilla at an appropriate time should be kept
under review.

35. On 24 August 1990, the text of the conclusions and recommendations was
transmitted to the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations for the attention of his
Government.

6. Bermuda

36. The Special Committee considered the question of Bermuda at its
1363rd meeting, on 1 August 1990.

working papers prepared by the Secretariat containing information on
developments concerning the Territory (A/AC.109/1025), military activities
(A/AC.109/1027) and on foreign economic and other interests (A/AC.109/1028).

-116-



38. At the 1363rd meeting, on 1 August, the Rapporteur of the Subcommittee on
Small Territories introduced the report of the Subcommittee (A/AC.109/L.1727),

39. At the same meeting, the representative of Tunisia, in his capacity as
Chairman of the Subcommittee on Small Territories, made a statement
(A/AC.109/PV.1363).

Decision of the Special Committee

40. At its 1363rd meeting, on 1 August 1990, the Special Committee adopted the
report of the Subcommittee on Small Territories and endorsed the conclusions and
recommendations contained therein. The text of the conclusions and
recommendations is reproduced below (see also para. 114, draft resolution III):

(1) The Special Committee reaffirms the inalienable right of the
people of Bermuda to self-determination and independence in conformity with
the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples, contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of
14 December 1960.

(2) The Special Committee reiterates the view that such factors as
territorial size, geographical location, size of population and limited
natural resources should in no way delay the speedy exercise by the people
of Bermuda of their inalienable right to self-determination and
independence in conformity with the Declaration contained in General
Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), which fully applies to the Territory.

(3) The Special Committee reiterates further that it is the
responsibility of the administering Power to create such conditions in the
Territory as will enable the people of Bermuda to exercise freely and
without interference their inalienable right to self-determination and
independence in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) as
well as all other relevant resolutions of the Assembly.

(4) The Special Committee reaffirms that it is ultimately for the
people of Bermuda themselves to determine their future political status.
In this connection, the Committee reaffirms the importance of fostering an
awareness among the people of the Territory of the possibilities open to
them in the exercise of their right to self-determination and independence
in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and
the Declaration.

(5) The Special Committee notes that, following the general elections
of 1989, during which the ruling United Bermuda Party retained power in the
House of Assembly despite the loss of eight seats, its leader, the Prime
Minister, stated that the question of independence was no longer a major
issue because the majority of the people did not seem to want independence
at present. The Committee also notes that the leader of the largest
opposition party, the Progressive Labour Party, considers that independence
would help to unify the people of Bermuda. In this connection, the
Committee notes that the Governor of Bermuda stated that the Government of
Bermuda recognized that it had a responsibility to obtain pertinent
information on the question of independence should circumstances change.

(6) The Special Committee reaffirms its strong conviction that the
presence of military bases and installations in the Territory could

-117-



constitute a major obstacle to the implementation of the Declaration and
that it is the responsibility of the administering Power to ensure that the
existence of such bases and installations does not hinder the population of
the Territory from exercising its right to self-determination and
independence in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter.

(7) The Special Committee urges the administering Power to continue
to take all necessary measures not to involve Bermuda in any offensive acts
or interference against other States and to comply fully with the purposes
and principles of the Charter, the Declaration and the resolutions and
decisions of the General Assembly relating to military activities and
arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their administration.

(8) The Special Committee reaffirms the responsibility of the
administering Power to promote the economic and social development of the
Territory. The Committee recommends that priority should continue to be
given to the diversification of the Territory’s economy in order to provide
the foundations for sound social and economic development. In this
connection, the Committee notes that in January 1988, the Government of
Bermuda started work on a new development plan for the Territory with a
view to involving the public as closely as possible in its preparation.

(9) The Special Committee urges the administering Power, in
cooperation with the territorial Government, to continue to take effective
measures to safeguard and guarantee the inalienable right of the people of
Bermuda to own and dispose of the natural resources of the Territory,
including marine resources, and to establish and maintain control over the
future development of those resources.

(10) The Special Committee calls upon the specialized agencies and
other organizations of the United Nations system, to continue to take all
necessary measures to accelerate progress in the social and economic life
of the Territory. In this respect, the Committee notes with appreciation
the continued contribution of the United Nations Development Programme, as
well as regional institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, to
the development of the Territory.

(11) The Special Committee notes with concern the vulnerability of the
Territory to drug activities and, in that connection, calls upon the
administering Power to continue to take all necessary measures, in
cooperation with the territorial Government, to combat the drug problem in
all its aspects within the Territory.

(12) Mindful that United Nations visiting missions provide an
effective means of assessing the situation in Non-Self-Governing
Territories, the Special Committee considers that the possibility of
sending a visiting mission to Bermuda at an appropriate time should be kept
under review.

report of the Subcommittee on Small Territories and endorsed the conclusions and
recommendations contained therein. The text of the conclusions and
recommendations is reproduced below (see also para. 114, draft resolution IV):

(1) The Special Committee reaffirms the inalienable right of the
people of the British Virgin Islands to self-determination and independence
in conformity with the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to
Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in General Assembly resolution
1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960.

(2) The Special Committee reiterates the view that such factors as
territorial size, geographical location, size of population and limited
natural resources should in no way delay the speedy exercise by the people
of the British Virgin Islands of their inalienable right to
self-determination and independence in conformity with the Declaration,
which fully applies to the Territory.

(3) The Special Committee reiterates further that it is the
responsibility of the administering Power to create such conditions in the
Territory as will enable the people of the British Virgin Islands to
exercise freely and without interference their inalienable right to
self-determination and independence in accordance with General Assembly
resolution 1514 (XV), as well as all other relevant resolutions of the
Assembly.

people of the British Virgin Islands themselves to determine freely their
future political status in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration, and in this connection,
reaffirms the importance of fostering an awareness among the people of the
Territory of the possibilities open to them in the exercise of their right
to self-determination.

22 December 1987 by the territorial Government that it would introduce

-119-



(6) The Special Committee urges the administering Power, in
cooperation with the territorial Government, to take effective measures to

Virgin Islands to own and dispose of the natural resources of the
Territory, including marine resources, and to establish and maintain
control over the future development of those resources.

(7) The Special Committee welcomes the contribution to the
development of the Territory by the specialized agencies and other
organizations of the United Nations system, particularly the United Nations
Development Programme, as well as regional organizations, including the

their measures to accelerate progress in the social and economic
development of the British Virgin Islands.

(8) The Special Committee reaffirms the responsibility of the
administering Power to promote the economic and social development of the
Territory. The Committee calls upon the administering Power to intensify
its efforts, in cooperation with the territorial Government, to broaden the
economic base of the Territory through diversification and, in that
connection, further calls upon the administering Power to continue to
increase its assistance to the Territory in the rehabilitation and
reconstruction of the economy.

(9) The Special Committee notes the severe effects of hurricane Hugo
on the Territory’s economy, particularly on its infrastructure, agriculture
and tourism sectors, as well as the adverse consequences of the hurricane
on the Government’s economic diversification efforts.

(10) The Special Committee recalls General Assembly resolution 44/3 of
12 October 1989, entitled "Emergency assistance to Antigua and Barbuda, the
British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Montserrat and Saint Kitts and Nevis", in
which the Assembly, inter alia, urges all States, as a matter of urgency,
to contribute generously to the relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction
efforts in those countries affected by hurricane Hugo. The Committee also
recalls resolution 44/95 of 11 December 1989 on the question of the British
Virgin Islands, in which the Assembly urges Member States and specialized
agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system to extend all
possible assistance with a view to rehabilitating and reconstructing the
Territory, which was devasted by hurricane Hugo.

(11) The Special Committee notes that domestic fishing output
continues to be hampered by the sophisticated techniques of foreign
vessels. The Committee reiterates its concern over the continued illegal
operations of foreign fishermen and stresses that this uncontrolled
exploitation could deplete current fish stocks and adversely affect future
yields. In that connection, the Committee calls upon the administering
Power to continue to assist the territorial Government in controlling the
illegal operations of foreign fishing vessels in the Territory’s waters.

(12) The Special Committee notes the continued participation of the
Territory in regional organizations, including the Caribbean Development
Bank. The Committee further notes the participation of the Territory in
international organizations, including the Caribbean Group for Cooperation
for Economic Development, sponsored by the World Bank, the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the Economic
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and its subsidiary bodies,

-120-



and reiterates its call upon the administering Power to continue to
facilitate the further participation of the British Virgin Islands in those
organizations and in other organizations of the United Nations system.

(13) The Special Committee notes that expatriates still account for a
large share of the employed labour force and that there is a critical need
for the training of nationals in the technical, vocational, managerial and
professional fields. The Committee takes note of the policy of the
Government to improve the education and qualifications of the Territory’s
human resources and, in that connection, welcomes the establishment of the
British Virgin Islands College, which would meet the needs of the public
and private sectors of the Territory. The Committee reiterates its call
upon the administering Power, in cooperation with the territorial
Government, to facilitate the adoption of a human resources training
programme, in order to expand the participation of the local population in
the decision-making process in all sectors and to fill managerial and
technical positions with local persons.

(14) The Special Committee notes with concern the vulnerability of the
Territory to drug-trafficking and money-laundering activities and, in that
connection, calls upon the administering Power to continue to take all
necessary measures, in cooperation with the territorial Government, to
combat the drug problem in all its aspects within the Territory.

(15) Mindful that United Nations visiting missions provide an
effective means of assessing at firsthand the situation prevailing in
Non-Self-Governing Territories, the Special Committee reiterates the view
that the possibility of sending a further visiting mission to the British
Virgin Islands should be kept under review.

of the Cayman Islands of their inalienable right to self-determination and
independence in conformity with the Declaration contained in General
Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), which fully applies to the Territory.

(3) The Special Committee reiterates further that it is the
responsibility of the administering Power to create such conditions in the
Territory as will enable the people of the Cayman Islands to exercise
freely and without interference their inalienable right to
self-determination and independence in accordance with General Assembly
resolution 1514 (XV), as well as all other relevant resolutions of the
Assembly.

(4) The Special Committee reaffirms that it is ultimately for the
people of the Cayman Islands themselves to determine their future political
status. In this connection, the Committee reaffirms the importance of

possibilities open to them in the exercise of their right to
self-determination and independence, in accordance with the principles of
the Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration.

(5) The Special Committee notes that expatriates still account for a
large share of the employed labour force and that there is a critical need
for the training of nationals in the technical, vocational, managerial and
professional fields. In this connection, the Committee takes note of the
efforts of the territorial Government to implement its localization
programme to promote increased participation of the local population in the
decision-making process in the Cayman Islands. It calls upon the
administering Power, in consultation with the territorial Government, to
facilitate the expansion of the current localization programme.

(6) The Special Committee reaffirms the responsibility of the
administering Power to promote the economic and social development of the
Territory. In this connection, the Committee recommends that priority
should continue to be given to the diversification of the Territory’s
economy in order to provide the foundations for sound social and economic
development. Noting the steps taken by the territorial Government to
promote agricultural production, the Committee calls on the administering
Power to provide the necessary assistance in this field so as to solve the
serious problem of the Territory’s heavy dependence on imported foodstuffs.

(7) The Special Committee urges the administering Power, in
cooperation with the territorial Government, to take effective measures to
safeguard and guarantee the inalienable right of the people of the Cayman
Islands to own and dispose of the natural resources of the Territory,
including marine resources, and to establish and maintain control over the

-122-



future development of those resources. In this connection, the Committee
takes note of reports of growing concern in the Territory over the sale of
land to foreign investors and expresses its concern that property and land
development continue to be controlled largely by foreign investors.

(8) The Special Committee calls upon the specialized agencies and
other organizations of the United Nations system to continue to take all
necessary measures to accelerate progress in the social and economic life
of the Territory. In this respect, the Committee notes with appreciation
the continued contribution of the United Nations Development Programme, as
well as regional institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, to
the development of the Territory.

(9) The Special Committee notes with concern the vulnerability of the
Territory to drug smuggling, money laundering and other illicit activities
and, in that connection, calls upon the administering Power to continue to
take all necessary measures, in cooperation with the territorial
Government, to combat these problems in all their aspects within the
Territory. The Committee takes note of the extension to 25 November 1988
of the 1984 Narcotics Agreement between the Cayman Islands, the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of
America and notes further that there has been mutual cooperation in this
regard. The Committee also takes note of the signing in November 1989 at
Miami, Florida, United States, by the Government of the Cayman Islands,
together with 18 other countries of the region, of a Caribbean customs
agreement entitled "Memorandum of Understanding regarding Mutual Assistance
and Cooperation for the Prevention and Repression of Customs Offences in

problems arising from the smuggling of funds, money laundering and false
invoicing, as well as the detection of various kinds of white-collar fraud
and the interdiction of illegal drugs.

Territories, the Special Committee considers that the possibility of
sending a further visiting mission to the Cayman Islands at an appropriate
time should be kept under review.

of Montserrat of their inalienable right to self-determination and
independence in conformity with the Declaration contained in General
Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), which fully applies to the Territory.

administering Power to promote the economic and social development of the
Territory. In this connection, the Committee reiterates the importance of
diversifying the Territory’s economy in order to provide the foundations

cooperation with the territorial Government, to take effective measures to
safeguard, guarantee and ensure the inalienable right of the people of
Montserrat to own and dispose of its natural resources, including its
marine resources, and to establish and maintain control over the future
development of those resources.

-124-



(8) The Special Committee notes the observation of the Caribbean
Development Bank that emigration would exacerbate the shortage of human
resources and urges the administering Power, in cooperation with the
territorial Government, to provide incentives to assist nationals in
finding better opportunities at home and to attract qualified nationals
from abroad.

(9) The Special Committee emphasizes the importance of taking
measures to broaden the educational programme and notes with satisfaction
the policy of the Government to develop the Territory’s human resources
through the rationalization of the educational system. In this regard, the
Special Committee urges the administering Power to continue to provide the
necessary assistance to the Territory.

(10) The Special Committee expresses its sympathies to the people of
Montserrat for the devastation wrought on the Territory by hurricane Hugo
in 1989 and welcomes the assistance extended to the Territory by the
administering Power, other Member States and relevant agencies of the
United Nations system.

(11) The Special Committee notes that, owing to the magnitude of the
devastation in Montserrat, the Territory will require substantial
assistance in its rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts. In this
regard, the Special Committee urges the administering Power, other Member
States and relevant agencies of the United Nations system to continue to
contribute generously to such efforts, in accordance with General Assembly
resolution 44/3 of 12 October 1989.

(12) The Special Committee welcomes the contribution to the
development of the Territory by the United Nations Development Programme,
the United Nations Children’s Fund and all specialized agencies and
organizations of the United Nations system operating in Montserrat. In
this regard, the Committee calls upon these and other international and
regional organizations, as well as donor Governments, to intensify their
efforts to accelerate progress in the economic and social development of
the Territory.

(13) The Special Committee reiterates that, since the administering
Power withdrew the associate membership of Montserrat from the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 1983, the
Territory has not been able to benefit fully from the activities of that
agency. The Committee, noting the interest of the Government of Montserrat
in readmission of the Territory as an associate member of the agency and
noting with concern that no action has been taken in this regard, once
again reiterates its call upon the administering Power, in cooperation with
the territorial Government, to take urgent steps to facilitate such
readmission.

(14) The Special Committee recalls that United Nations missions
visited the Territory in 1975 and 1982. Mindful that visiting missions
provide an effective means of assessing the situation in the
Non-Self-Governing Territories, the Committee considers that the
possibility of sending a further visiting mission to Montserrat at an
appropriate time should be kept under review.

obligation of the administering Power to create such conditions in the
Territory as will enable the people of the Turks and Caicos Islands to
exercise freely and without interference their inalienable right to
self-determination and independence in accordance with General Assembly
resolution 1514 (XV), as well as other relevant resolutions of the
Assembly.

(4) The Special Committee reaffirms that it is ultimately for the
people of the Turks and Caicos Islands themselves to determine freely their
future political status. In this connection, the Committee reaffirms the
importance of fostering an awareness among the people of the Territory of
the possibilities open to them in the exercise of their right to
self-determination and independence in accordance with the principles of
the Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration.

(5) The Special Committee notes the entry into force of a new
Constitution under the Turks and Caicos Islands Constitution Order 1988.

the administering Power, in consultation with the territorial Government,
to continue to take the necessary measures to promote the economic and
social development of the Turks and Caicos Islands.

(7) The Special Committee urges the administering Power, in
cooperation with the territorial Government, to take effective measures to
safeguard and guarantee the inalienable right of the people of the Turks
and Caicos Islands to own and dispose of the natural resources of the
Territory, including marine resources, and to establish and maintain
control over the future development of those resources. The Committee
notes the announcement by the United Kingdom that, as from 1 January 1990,
the territorial waters of the Turks and Caicos Islands would be expanded
from three to twelve miles.

(8) The Special Committee calls upon the specialized agencies and
other organizations of the United Nations system to continue to take all
necessary measures to accelerate progress in the social and economic life
of the Territory. In this respect, the Committee notes with appreciation
the continued contribution of the United Nations Development Programme, as
well as regional institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, to
the development of the Territory.

the territorial Government of a national development plan with a view to

-129-



expanding the infrastructure of the Territory and strengthening several key
sectors, including tourism, fisheries, water resources management and human
resources development. It also notes the appointment by the territorial
Government of a new Tourist Board that is fully representative of all
sectors of the industry, aimed at ensuring that Turks and Caicos Islanders
have an equal opportunity to join the mainstream of development and
employment in tourism.

(10) The Special Committee notes the establishment, under the 1988
Constitution, of a Public Service Commission (PSC) to advise the Governor
on civil service matters, and of a Public Service Training Board under PSC
to advise on, and assist in, the supervision of policies and programmes for
the training of public officers at all levels. The Committee urges the
administering Power, in consultation with the territorial Government, to
continue to provide the necessary assistance for the local staffing of the
civil service at all levels and for the training of qualified local
personnel in the skills essential to the social and economic development of
the Territory.

(11) The Special Committee notes with concern the vulnerability of the
Territory to drug activities and, in that connection, calls upon the
administering Power to continue to take all necessary measures, in
cooperation with the territorial Government, to combat the drug problem in
all its aspects within the Territory.

(12) Mindful that United Nations visiting missions provide an
effective means of assessing the situation in the Non-Self-Governing
Territories, the Special Committee considers that the possibility of
sending a further visiting mission to the Turks and Caicos Islands at an
appropriate time should be kept under review.

transmitted to the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the United

Tokelau.

economy in order to provide the foundations for sound social and economic
development.

cooperation with the territorial Government, to take effective measures to

other organizations of the United Nations system to continue to take all
necessary measures to accelerate progress in the social and economic life
of the Territory. In this respect, the Committee notes with appreciation

the development of the Territory.

(13) The Special Committee takes note with appreciation of the relief
assistance extended to Tokelau by the administering Power, other Member
States and international organizations, in particular the United Nations
Development Programme and the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief
Coordinator, following the natural disasters caused by cyclone Ofa in
February 1990.

(14) The Special Committee calls on all governmental and
non-governmental organizations, financial institutions, Member States and
agencies of the United Nations system to grant Tokelau special emergency
economic assistance to mitigate the effects of cyclone Ofa, and to enable
the Territory to meet its medium- and long-term reconstruction and
rehabilitation requirements.

(15) The Special Committee takes note of the decision of the General
Fono (Council) to include Tokelau in the multilateral Fisheries Agreement
between the United States of America and States members of the Forum
Fisheries Agency, and urges the administering Power to ensure that the
fishing grounds of the Territory are protected.

consultation with the General Fono (Council), to continue to expand its
development assistance to Tokelau in order to promote the economic and
social development of the Territory.

(17) The Special Committee takes note of an inspection of the Tokelau
Public Service and the Apia staff undertaken by the State Services
Commission in February/March 1989 and expresses the hope that the
completion of this inspection has contributed to the development of the
Public Service of the Territory.

-132-



(18) The Special Committee takes due note of the strong opposition
consistently expressed by the people of Tokelau to nuclear tests being
carried out in the Pacific region and their concern that the tests
constitute a grave threat to the natural resources of the Territory and its
social and economic development. In this regard, the Committee takes note
of relevant General Assembly resolutions.

(19) The Special Committee takes note of the other major environmental
concerns expressed by the people of Tokelau, including the impact that a
sealevel rise resulting from global climate change would have on the
low-lying atolls of Tokelau, the dumping of toxic waste in the region and
the practice of driftnet fishing, and calls on all Member States and
organizations of the United Nations system to implement the relevant
provisions of General Assembly resolutions in this regard, in particular
resolutions 44/206, 44/225 and 44/226, all of 22 December 1989.

(20) The Special Committee welcomes the assistance extended to Tokelau
by the United Nations Development Programme and takes note of the
consideration being given to the installation of a new satellite system in
the Territory with a view to assisting the free flow of information, as
well as the education process in the Territory.

(21) The Special Committee invites the specialized agencies and other
organizations of the United Nations system, as well as regional and
international institutions, to extend all possible assistance to Tokelau
with a view to accelerating progress in the social and the economic life of
the Territory. Such assistance should take due account of the decisions of
the General Fono (Council) on the development priorities of the Territory
and the wish of the people to preserve their unique lifestyle.

(22) The Special Committee takes note that the administering Power is
investigating ways of improving the shipping services to Tokelau to ensure
better communication with the outside world, and that efforts are being
made towards the early establishment of an inter-atoll service.

(23) Bearing in mind the importance of the information provided by the
United Nations Visiting Mission to Tokelau, 1986, in assessing the
situation in the Territory, the Special Committee considers that the
possibility of sending a further visiting mission to Tokelau at an
appropriate time should be kept under review.

83. On 24 August, the text of the conclusions and recommendations was
transmitted to the Permanent Representative of New Zealand to the United Nations
for the attention of her Government.

14. American Samoa

report of the Subcommittee on Small Territories and endorsed the conclusions and
recommendations contained therein. The text of the conclusions and
recommendations reads as follows (see also para. 114, draft resolution IX):

(1) The Special Committee reaffirms the inalienable right of the
people of American Samoa to self-determination and independence in
conformity with the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples, contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)
of 14 December 1960.

(2) The Special Committee reiterates the view that such factors as

of the Territory of their inalienable right to self-determination and
independence in conformity with the Declaration, which fully applies to
American Samoa.

(3) The Special Committee reiterates further that it is the
responsibility of the administering Power to create such conditions in the

importance of fostering an awareness among the people of the Territory of
the possibilities open to them in the exercise of their right to
self-determination and independence in accordance with the principles of
the Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration.

(5) The Special Committee reaffirms the responsibility of the
administering Power to promote the economic and social development of the
Territory and, in this connection, recommends that priority should be given
to the diversification of the Territory’s economy in order to provide the
foundations for sound social and economic development, to reduce its heavy
economic and financial dependence on the United States and to create more
employment opportunities for the people of the Territory.

(6) The Special Committee urges the administering Power, in
cooperation with the territorial Government, to take effective measures to
safeguard and guarantee the inalienable right of the people of American
Samoa to own and dispose of the natural resources of the Territory,
including marine resources, and to establish and maintain control over the
future development of those resources.

(7) The Special Committee notes with grave concern the destruction
wrought by cyclone Ofa in February 1990 and, in this respect, notes the

-134-



speedy emergency assistance provided to the Territory and urges that this
assistance be continued.

(8) The Special Committee calls upon the specialized agencies and
other organizations of the United Nations system to continue to take all
necessary measures to accelerate progress in the social and economic life
of the Territory.

communities in the region and promote cooperation between the territorial
Government and regional institutions, as well as the specialized agencies
and other organizations of the United Nations system.

(10) Mindful that United Nations visiting missions provide an
effective means of assessing the situation in the Non-Self-Governing
Territories, the Special Committee reiterates the value of sending a
further visiting mission to American Samoa and requests the administering
Power to facilitate such a mission.

89. On 24 August, the text of the conclusions and recommendations was

working papers prepared by the Secretariat containing information on
developments concerning the Territory (A/AC.109/1017) and on military activities
(A/AC.109/1018).

92. At the 1363rd meeting, on 1 August, the Rapporteur of the Subcommittee on

Corr.1), containing an account of its consideration of the Territory

Decision of the Special Committee

94. At its 1364th meeting, on 2 August 1990, following a statement by the
representative of the United States, the administering Power concerned
(A/AC.109/PV.1364), the Special Committee adopted the report of the Subcommittee
on Small Territories and endorsed the conclusions and recommendations contained
therein. The text of the conclusions and recommendations reads as follows (see
also para. 114, draft resolution X):

(1) The Special Committee reaffirms the inalienable right of the
people of Guam to self-determination and independence in conformity with
the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and

-135-



Peoples contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of
14 December 1960.

(2) The Special Committee reiterates the view that such factors as
territorial size, geographical location, size of population and limited
natural resources should in no way delay the speedy exercise by the people
of Guam of their inalienable right to self-determination and independence
in conformity with the Declaration contained in General Assembly resolution
1514 (XV), which fully applies to the Territory.

(3) The Special Committee reiterates further that it is the
responsibility of the administering Power to create such conditions in the
Territory as will enable the people of Guam to exercise freely and without
interference their inalienable right to self-determination and independence
in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), as well as all
other relevant resolutions of the Assembly.

(4) The Special Committee reaffirms that it is ultimately for the
people of Guam themselves to determine freely their future political
status. In this connection, the Committee reaffirms the importance of
fostering an awareness among the people of the Territory of the
possibilities open to them in the exercise of their right to
self-determination and independence in accordance with the principles of
the Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration.

(5) The Special Committee recalls that, in referendums held in Guam
in 1987, a draft Commonwealth Act was endorsed by the people of Guam which,
upon expeditious enactment by the Congress of the United States of America,
would reaffirm the right of the people of Guam to draft their own
constitution and to govern themselves. The Committee urges the
administering Power to give full recognition to the status and rights of
the Chamorro people and, in this context, takes note of the statement by
the representative of the administering Power that the cultural identity of
the Chamorro people, the indigenous inhabitants of Guam, would be
recognized. The Committee also notes that the draft Commonwealth Act
provides that the Congress of the United States would recognize the
inalienable right to self-determination of the Chamorro people, for which
provisions would be made in the Guam Constitution.

(6) The Special Committee reaffirms its strong conviction that the
presence of military bases and installations in the Territory could
constitute a major obstacle to the implementation of the Declaration and
that it is the responsibility of the administering Power to ensure that the
existence of such bases and installations does not hinder the population of
the Territory from exercising its right to self-determination and
independence in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter.
In this regard, the Special Committee recalls all the relevant resolutions
and decisions of the General Assembly relating to military activities and
arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their administration.

(7) The Special Committee urges the administering Power to continue
to take all necessary measures not to involve the Territory in any
offensive acts or interference against other States and to comply fully
with the purposes and principles of the Charter, the Declaration and the
resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly relating to military
activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their
administration.

-136-



(8) The Special Committee reaffirms the responsibility of the
administering Power to promote the economic and social development of the
Territory and, in this connection, recommends that priority should be given
to the diversification of the Territory’s economy in order to provide the
foundations for sound social and economic development.

(9) The Special Committee notes the statement by the representative
of the administering Power concerning the growth in tourism and the desire
of the Government of Guam for balanced economic growth. In this
connection, it calls upon the administering Power to take further steps to
strengthen and diversify the economy of the Territory with a view to
reducing its economic dependence on the administering Power.

(10) The Special Committee urges the administering Power, in
cooperation with the territorial Government, to take effective measures to
safeguard and guarantee the inalienable right of the people of Guam to own
and dispose of the natural resources of the Territory, including marine
resources, and to establish and maintain control over the future
development of those resources. In this connection, the Committee notes
the potential for diversifying and developing the economy of Guam offered
by, for example, commercial fishing and agriculture, and reaffirms its call
upon the administering Power to support measures by the territorial
Government aimed at removing constraints to growth in those areas and to
ensure their development to the fullest extent.

(11) The Special Committee calls upon the specialized agencies and
other organizations of the United Nations system to continue to take all
necessary measures to accelerate progress in the social and economic life
of the Territory.

(12) The Special Committee notes that one of the obstacles to economic
growth, particularly to agricultural development, stems from the fact that
large tracts of land are held by the United States federal authorities
(30 per cent for military and 1 per cent for non-military purposes). The
Committee further notes that the 1977 Guam Land Use Plan had recommended
the release of 2,100 hectares of surplus federal land to the Government of
Guam and that, according to information transmitted to the Committee in
April 1990 by the Guam Commission on Self-Determination, 190 hectares had
been transferred by the Navy to the Government of Guam, a further 462
hectares of the identified land had been released and an additional
175 hectares are in the process of being returned to the Government of
Guam. In this connection, the Committee calls upon the administering
Power, in cooperation with the territorial Government, to expedite the
transfer of remaining land held by the United States federal authorities to
the people of the Territory and to take the necessary steps to protect
their property rights.

(13) Mindful that United Nations visiting missions provide an
effective means of assessing the situation in the Non-Self-Governing
Territories, the Special Committee reiterates the view that the possibility
of sending a further visiting mission to Guam at an appropriate time should
be kept under review.

Nations for the attention of his Government.

(5) The Special Committee takes note of the statement by the
representative of the administering Power that her Government continues to
maintain its long-standing support for the principle of self-determination
and that the Territories under its administration are pursuing their right
to self-determination at a pace of their own choosing. The Committee also
takes note of the statement by the representative of the administering
Power that the referendum on the future status of the United States Virgin
Islands planned for November 1989 has been rescheduled by the territorial
Government for June 1991, as a result of the devastation of hurricane Hugo
(in September 1989). The Committee also notes that provision has been made
for a further run-off election in December 1991.

(6) The Special Committee also notes that the public education
programme was begun in January 1989 and that efforts are being made to
streamline the political education and referendum process by, inter alia,
dividing the seven political options into three categories. The Committee

Government, to facilitate the ongoing political education programme in the
Territory in order to foster an awareness among the people of the
possibilities open to them in the exercise of their right to
self-determination in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1541 (XV)
of 15 December 1960.

(7) The Special Committee takes note of the statement by the
representative of the Territory that the Commission on Status and Federal
Relations considered, inter alia, the relevance of international law in the
process of self-determination, voter residency requirements for political
status referendums and the role of the United Nations in observing acts of
self-determination. The Committee takes note of the concerns expressed by
the Commission and the territorial Government regarding residency
requirements for participation in acts of self-determination. In this
context, the Special Committee takes note of the relevant United Nations
resolutions regarding acts of self-determination in colonial Territories.

(8) The Special Committee urges the administering Power to take all
necessary measures to comply fully with the purposes and principles of the
Charter, the Declaration and the relevant resolutions and decisions of the
General Assembly relating to military activities and arrangements by
colonial Powers in Territories under their administration.

(9) The Special Committee urges the administering Power, in
cooperation with the territorial Government, to take effective measures to
continue to safeguard and guarantee the inalienable right of the people of
the United States Virgin Islands to own and dispose of the natural
resources of the Territory, including marine resources, and to establish
and maintain control over the future development of those resources.

(10) The Special Committee calls upon the specialized agencies and
other organizations of the United Nations system to continue to take all

-139-



necessary measures to accelerate progress in the social and economic life
of the Territory.

(11) The Special Committee reaffirms the responsibility of the
administering Power to continue to promote the economic and social
development of the United States Virgin Islands and reiterates the
importance of diversifying the Territory’s economy with a view to reducing
its heavy economic dependence on the administering Power.

(12) The Special Committee notes with concern the devastation caused
by hurricane Hugo to the Territory, particularly to its social and economic
infrastructure and to the tourism and agricultural sectors. In this
regard, the Committee urges the administering Power, Member States and
relevant agencies of the United Nations system to continue to contribute
generously towards the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Territory
in accordance with General Assembly resolution 44/99 of 11 December 1989.

(13) The Special Committee takes due note of the concern consistently
expressed by representatives of the Save Long Bay Coalition, Inc. and by
the territorial Government regarding the activities of the West Indian
Company Ltd. (WICO), a Danish development company, in the reclamation and
development of submerged land at Long Bay in the Charlotte Amalie Harbour.
The Committee recalls that the issue had been settled by litigation and
that the activities of WICO are subject to the regulatory powers of the
Government of the United States Virgin Islands and notes other statements
by the representative of the territorial Government that the latter would
seek external resources to acquire the property.

(14) The Special Committee notes the statement by the Governor in
February 1990 that he had requested permission from the administering Power
to seek associate membership in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean
States.

(15) Mindful of the importance of the participation of the Territory
in regional and international organizations, the Special Committee notes
that the Territory has continued to expand its cooperation with other
Caribbean Governments and reiterates its call upon the administering Power
to continue to facilitate the participation of the Territory in those
bodies, as well as in those organizations in which the Territory has
expressed an interest in seeking membership and at which the Territory will
be the subject of discussion. In this connection, the Special Committee
notes that a representative of the Territory continues to participate, as a
member of the delegation of the administering Power, in annual meetings of
the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development. In this
regard, the Committee reiterates its call upon the administering Power to
seek a status in that Group for the territorial Government similar to that
of other dependent Territories within the Group.

(16) The Special Committee notes with concern the vulnerability of the
Territory to drug activities and the activities of the territorial
Government to eradicate the production, distribution and use of illicit
drugs. In that connection, the Committee calls upon the administering
Power to continue to take all necessary measures, in cooperation with the
territorial Government, to combat the drug problem in all its aspects
within the Territory.

-140-



(17) Mindful that United Nations visiting missions provide an
effective means of assessing the situation in the Non-Self-Governing
Territories, and taking note of the statement by the representative of the
administering Power that the possibility of sending a visiting mission to
observe the referendum to be held in June 1991 would be taken into
consideration, the Special Committee considers that the possibility of
sending a further visiting mission to the United States Virgin Islands
should be kept under review.

104. On 24 August, the text of the conclusions and recommendations was
transmitted to the Permanent Representative of the United States to the United
Nations for the attention of his Government.

17. Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands

105. The Special Committee considered the question of the Trust Territory of the
Pacific Islands at its 1363rd meeting, on 1 August 1990.

107. At the 1363rd meeting, on 1 August, the Rapporteur of the Subcommittee on

Chairman of the Subcommittee on Small Territories, made a statement
(A/AC.109/PV.1363).

Decision of the Special Committee

109. At the 1363rd meeting, on 1 August 1990, following statements by the
representatives of Chile and Norway (A/AC.109/PV.1363), the Special Committee
adopted the report of the Subcommittee on Small Territories and endorsed the
conclusions and recommendations contained therein, it being understood that the
reservations expressed by members would be reflected in the record of the
meeting. The text of the conclusions and recommendations reads as follows (see
also para. 114, draft resolution XII):

(1) The Special Committee reaffirms the inalienable right of the
people of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands to self-determination
and independence in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and
the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples, contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of
14 December 1960. The Committee reaffirms the importance of ensuring that
the people of the Trust Territory fully and freely exercise their
inalienable right and that the obligations of the Administering Authority
are duly discharged under the Trusteeship Agreement 3/ and the Charter.

(2) The Special Committee reiterates the view that such factors as
territorial size, geographical location, size of population and limited
natural resources should in no way delay the speedy implementation of the
Declaration, which fully applies to the Trust Territory.

-141-



(3) The Special Committee notes with regret the continued
non-participation of the Administering Authority in the work of the
Subcommittee during its consideration of the Trust Territory of the Pacific
Islands. In this regard, the Committee stresses the importance of
multilateral efforts within the framework of the United Nations for the
solution of the remaining problems of decolonization. It reiterates its
appeal to the Administering Authority to reconsider its decision and to
resume its participation in the work of the Special Committee, as well as
to provide the Committee with vital and up-to-date information on the
Territory, in accordance with its obligation under the Charter.

(4) The Special Committee notes with regret that there is no
cooperation between the Trusteeship Council and the Committee in relation
to the Trust Territory despite the expressed readiness of the Committee to
engage in such cooperation.

(5) The Special Committee recalls its previous appeals to the
Administering Authority that the people of the Trust Territory should be
given the fullest opportunity to inform and educate themselves about the
various options open to them in the exercise of their inalienable right to
self-determination and independence, and expresses the view that such
programmes should be extended and reinforced. The Committee recognizes
that it is ultimately for the people of the Trust Territory to decide their
political destiny, and calls upon the Administering Authority not to
fragment the Territory or take any action against the wishes of the people,
as expressed in any genuine act of self-determination, or their rights in
accordance with the Declaration.

(6) The Special Committee stresses the need to preserve the cultural
identity and heritage of the Micronesian people and calls upon the
Administering Authority to take all necessary steps towards that end.

(7) The Special Committee takes note of the intention of the
Administering Authority to seek the termination of the Trusteeship
Agreement and urges the Administering Authority to ensure that this is in
strict conformity with the Charter.

(8) The Special Committee notes the disputes which have arisen
between the local authorities of the Northern Mariana Islands and the
Administering Authority in relation to the Covenant to Establish a
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the
United States of America. 4/ It also notes that the referendum held in
Palau on 6 February 1990 on the Compact of Free Association failed to
attain the 75 per cent majority required under the Palau Constitution. 5/
The Committee reiterates its call upon the Administering Authority in that
connection to take all necessary steps to ensure the full enjoyment by the
people of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands as a whole of their
inalienable right to self-determination and independence, in accordance
with the Charter and the Declaration.

(9) The Special Committee, recalling General Assembly resolution
1514 (XV) and all other resolutions of the United Nations relating to
military bases and installations in colonial and Non-Self-Governing
Territories, reaffirms its strong conviction that the presence of military
bases and installations in the Trust Territory could constitute a major
obstacle to the implementation of the Declaration and that it is the
responsibility of the Administering Authority to ensure that the existence

-142-



of such bases and installations does not hinder the population of the
Territory from exercising its right to self-determination and independence
in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter.

(10) The Special Committee urges the Administering Authority to
continue to take all necessary measures not to involve the Trust Territory
in any offensive acts or interference against other States and to comply
fully with the purposes and principles of the Charter, the Declaration and
the resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly relating to military
activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their
administration.

(11) The Special Committee notes the concern expressed by the people
of the Trust Territory about the presence of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons in areas under their territorial jurisdiction. In this
regard, the Committee welcomes the interest of the Trust Territory in the
creation of a nuclear-free zone in the Pacific.

(12) The Special Committee, noting the increasing devolution of power
to the people of the Trust Territory, welcomes this development and urges
the Administering Authority to continue this process in accordance with the
Charter and the Declaration.

(13) The Special Committee, noting that the Trust Territory is still,
to a large extent, economically and financially dependent on the
Administering Authority, is of the view that the Administering Authority
should take all necessary measures to enable the people of the Trust
Territory to achieve economic independence. In this regard, the Committee
recalls the obligation of the Administering Authority relating to the
economic development of the Trust Territory.

(14) The Special Committee notes that all war damage claims under
Title II have already been settled and that payment of Title I war damage
claims is nearing completion. The Special Committee expresses the hope
that all remaining claims will be settled in the near future.

(15) The Special Committee urges the Administering Authority, in
cooperation with the local authorities of the Trust Territory, to safeguard
the inalienable right of the people of the Territory to their natural
resources, including marine resources, by taking effective measures to
guarantee their right to own and dispose of those resources and to
establish and maintain control over their future development. In this
connection, the Special Committee urges the Administering Authority to
assist the maritime authorities of the Trust Territory in strengthening the
existing legislation concerning the exploitation, management and
conservation of a 200-mile exclusive economic zone. The Committee
reaffirms its conviction that the rights of the people of Micronesia over
such a zone should be respected and that they should receive all benefits
deriving therefrom.

(16) The Special Committee stresses the need for improved social
services, particularly health care, in the Trust Territory, and underscores
the obligation of the Administering Authority to continue promoting that
sector. It further emphasizes the importance of encouraging greater
participation in the field of health care by qualified indigenous people.
It notes with satisfaction the continued cooperation in the health field
between the Trust Territory and the specialized agencies and other

-143-



organizations of the United Nations system, such as the World Health
Organization, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the United Nations
Population Fund and the United Nations Development Programme.

(17) The Special Committee welcomes the development of closer
relations between the local authorities of the Trust Territory and the
various regional and international agencies, in particular those
specialized agencies within the United Nations system. The Committee urges
that priority should continue to be given to the promotion of closer
contacts with countries of the region in all fields.

(18) The Special Committee notes that, under Article 83 of the
Charter, the Security Council exercises all functions of the United Nations
relating to strategic areas, including the approval of the terms of the
trusteeship agreements and of their alteration or amendment and, in this
regard, is confident that special attention will be given by the Security
Council to the full implementation of all provisions of the Trusteeship
Agreement and the Charter.

(19) The Special Committee takes note of the fact that the Trusteeship
Council, at its fifty-sixth session, 6/ noted with satisfaction the
assurances given by the Administering Authority that it would continue to
fulfil its responsibilities under the Charter and the Trusteeship
Agreement. The Committee reiterates its call upon the Administering
Authority in that connection to discharge those responsibilities in strict
conformity with the provisions of the Charter, particularly Article 83, and
the Declaration.

110. On 24 August, the text of the conclusions and recommendations was
transmitted to the Permanent Representative of the United States to the United
Nations for the attention of his Government and to the President of the Security
Council 7/ and the President of the Trusteeship Council for the attention of the
members of the respective organs. 8/

of the following draft decisions:

DRAFT DECISION I

Question of Pitcairn

The General Assembly, having examined the relevant chapter of the report of
the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples, 9/ reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of Pitcairn to
self-determination in conformity with the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, which fully applies to the
Territory. The Assembly further reaffirms the responsibility of the
administering Power to promote the economic and social development of the
Territory. The Assembly urges the administering Power to continue to respect
the very individual lifestyle that the people of the Territory have chosen and
to preserve, promote and protect it. The Assembly requests the Special
Committee to continue to examine the question at its next session and to report
thereon to the Assembly at its forty-sixth session.

DRAFT DECISION II

Question of St. Helena

The General Assembly, having examined the relevant chapters of the report
of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of
the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples, 14/ reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of St. Helena to
self-determination and independence in conformity with the Declaration on the
Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in

-177-



Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960. The Assembly urges the
administering Power, in consultation with the Legislative Council and other
representatives of the people of St. Helena, to continue to take all necessary
steps to ensure the speedy implementation of the Declaration in respect of the
Territory and, in that connection, reaffirms the importance of promoting an
awareness among the people of St. Helena of the possibilities open to them in
the exercise of their right to self-determination. The Assembly reaffirms the
responsibility of the administering Power to promote the economic and social
development of the Territory and calls upon the administering Power to continue,
in cooperation with the territorial Government, to strengthen the economy and to
increase its assistance to diversification programmes. The Assembly urges the
administering Power, in cooperation with the territorial Government, to continue
to take effective measures to safeguard and guarantee the inalienable right of
the people of St. Helena to own and dispose of the natural resources of the
Territory, including marine resources, and to establish and maintain control
over the future development of those resources. The Assembly expresses the view
that the administering Power should continue to implement infrastructure and
community development projects aimed at improving the general welfare of the
community, including the unemployment situation, and to encourage local
initiative and enterprise, particularly in the areas of fisheries development,
forestry, handicrafts and agriculture. The Assembly, in view of the serious
developments in South Africa, notes with concern the trade and transportation
dependency of the Territory on South Africa. The Assembly reaffirms that
continued development assistance from the administering Power, together with any
assistance that the international community might be able to provide,
constitutes an important means of developing the economic potential of the
Territory and of enhancing the capacity of its people to realize fully the goals
set forth in the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. The
Assembly, in that connection, welcomes the assistance rendered by the United
Nations Development Programme and invites other organizations of the United
Nations system to assist in the development of the Territory. The Assembly
notes with deep concern the continued presence of military facilities on the
dependency of Ascension Island and, in that regard, recalls all the United
Nations resolutions and decisions concerning military bases and installations in
colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories. The Assembly urges the
administering Power to take all the necessary measures not to involve the
Territory in any offensive acts or interference against neighbouring States by
the racist régime of South Africa. The Assembly considers that the possibility
of dispatching a United Nations visiting mission to St. Helena at an appropriate
time should be kept under review, and requests the Special Committee to continue
to examine the question of St. Helena at its next session and to report thereon
to the Assembly at its forty-sixth session.

paragraph 11, is reproduced below:

The Special Committee,

Having considered the question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas),

Aware that the maintenance of colonial situations is incompatible with
the United Nations ideal of universal peace,

Recalling General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960,

of 14 August 1987, A/AC.109/972 of 11 August 1988 and A/AC.109/1008 of
15 August 1989 and Security Council resolutions 502 (1982) of 3 April 1982
and 505 (1982) of 26 May 1982,

Distressed that, notwithstanding the time that has elapsed since the
adoption of General Assembly resolution 2065 (XX), this prolonged dispute
has not yet been settled,

Aware of the interest of the international community in the resumption
by the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland of their negotiations in order to find as soon as possible
a peaceful, just and lasting solution to the sovereignty dispute relating
to the question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas),

Taking note with interest of the re-establishment of diplomatic
relations between Argentina and the United Kingdom, and of the agreements
set forth in the Joint statements issued by the Argentine and British
delegations in Madrid on 19 October 1989 3/ and on 15 February 1990, 4/

-181-



Considering that the new process of dialogue and co-operation between
Argentina and the United Kingdom should facilitate the resumption of the
negotiations in order to find a peaceful solution to the dispute over
sovereignty,

Reaffirming the principles of the Charter of the United Nations on the
non-use of force or the threat of force in international relations and the
peaceful settlement of international disputes,

Calling attention to the importance of the Secretary-General
continuing his efforts to give full effect to the mission entrusted to him
by the General Assembly in its resolutions on the question of the Falkland
Islands (Malvinas),

interests of the population of the islands in accordance with the
provisions of the General Assembly resolutions on the question of the
Falkland Islands (Malvinas),

1. Reiterates that the way to put an end to the special and
particular colonial situation in the question of the Falkland Islands
(Malvinas) is the peaceful and negotiated settlement of the dispute over
sovereignty between the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland;

2. Takes note with satisfaction of the fact that the Government of
Argentina has reiterated its intention to comply with the General Assembly
resolutions referring to the question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas);

3. Regrets that, in spite of such circumstances and of the
widespread international support for a negotiation between the Governments
of Argentina and the United Kingdom that includes all aspects of the future
of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), the implementation of the General
Assembly resolutions on this question has not yet started;

4. Urges the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to
consolidate the current process of dialogue and bilateral cooperation
through the resumption of negotiations in order to find as soon as possible
a peaceful solution to the sovereignty dispute relating to the question of
the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), in accordance with the provisions of
General Assembly resolutions 2065 (XX), 3160 (XXVIII), 31/49, 37/9, 38/12,
39/6, 40/21, 41/40, 42/19 and 43/25;

5. Reiterates its firm support for the renewed mission of good
offices undertaken by the Secretary-General in order to assist the parties
in complying with the request made by the General Assembly in its
resolutions on the question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas);

6. Decides to keep under review the question of the Falkland Islands
(Malvinas) subject to the directives that the General Assembly has issued
and may issue in that regard.

People’s Republic of Angola and the Republic of Cuba signed an Agreement; 1/
also, the People’s Republic of Angola, the Republic of Cuba and the Republic of
South Africa signed an Agreement. 2/ On 16 January 1989, the Security Council
unanimously adopted resolution 629 (1989), by which the Council decided,
inter alia, that 1 April 1989 should be the date on which implementation of its
resolution 435 (1978) of 29 September 1978 would begin; requested the

which would supervise and control free and fair elections in Namibia on the
basis of Council resolution 435 (1978). Elections for a Constituent Assembly of
72 members were held in Namibia from 7 to 11 November 1989. Accordingly, the
people of Namibia exercised their inalienable right to self-determination by

drafting a constitution for an independent Namibia. Pursuant to that process,
Namibia was granted independence on 21 March 1990.

marking the independence of Namibia. On that historic occasion, the Chairman
extended to the Government and people of the Republic of Namibia the Special
Committee’s warmest congratulations and most sincere wishes for happiness, peace
and prosperity in the coming years. That occasion represented for the Special
Committee, which had followed closely and constantly the progress towards
self-determination and independence of that country, the successful discharge of
the important responsibility entrusted to it by the General Assembly.

4. On 23 April 1990, the General Assembly, at the 1st plenary meeting of its
eighteenth special session, adopted resolution S-18/1, by which the Republic of
Namibia was admitted to membership in the United Nations. At the same meeting,
the Chairman of the Special Committee made a statement. 3/

5. The General Assembly considered the question of Namibia at its 96th plenary
meeting, on 11 September 1990, at which time the Chairman of the Special
Committee made a statement. 4/ At the same meeting, by adopting resolution

* Previously issued under the symbol A/45/23 (Part VIII).

** Namibia acceded to independence on 21 March 1990 as the Republic of
Namibia.

-184-



44/243, the Assembly dissolved the United Nations Council for Namibia and the
agenda item on the question of Namibia was deleted from the provisional agenda
of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly.
