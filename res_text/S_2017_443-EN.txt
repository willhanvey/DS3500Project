draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its resolutions 1373 (2001), 1624 (2005), 2178 (2014) and the 

Statement of its President (S/PRST/2016/6) of 11 May 2016,  

 Affirming its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace 

and security, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, 

 Reaffirming its commitment to sovereignty, territorial integrity and political 

independence of all States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, 

 Stressing that terrorism in all forms and manifestations constitutes one of the 

most serious threats to international peace and security and that any acts of 

terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivations, whenever 

and by whomsoever committed,  

 Emphasizing that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any 

religion, nationality or civilization,  

 Stressing that terrorism can only be defeated by a sustained and 

comprehensive approach involving the active participation and collaboration of all 

States and international and regional organizations to impede, impair, isolate, and 

incapacitate the terrorist threat,  

 Urging Member States and the United Nations system to take measures, 

pursuant to international law, to address all drivers of violent extremism conducive 

to terrorism, both internal and external, in a balanced manner as set out in the 

United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy,

 Recalling the measures aimed at countering violent extremism in order to 

prevent terrorism, as outlined in resolution 2178 (2014),  

 Stressing also that States must ensure that any measures taken to combat 

terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, and should adopt 

such measures in accordance with international law, in particular international 

human rights law, refugee law, and humanitarian law,  

 Reaffirming that acts, methods, and practices of terrorism are contrary to the 

purposes and principles of the United Nations and that financing, planning and 

inciting terrorist acts and supporting terrorist organizations are also contrary to the 

purposes and principles of the United Nations,  

 Recalling the right to freedom of expression, reflected in Article 19 of the 

Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the General Assembly in 1948 

(“the Universal Declaration”), and recalling also the right to freedom of expression 

in Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Politica l Rights adopted by 

the General Assembly in 1966 (“ICCPR”) and that any restrictions thereon shall 

only be such as are provided by law and are necessary on the grounds set out in 

paragraph 3 of Article 19 of the ICCPR,  

 Condemning in the strongest terms the incitement of terrorist acts and 

repudiating attempts at the justification or glorification (apologie) of terrorist acts 

that may incite further terrorist acts,  

 Stressing the importance of the role of the media, civil and religious society, 

the business community and educational institutions in those efforts to enhance 

dialogue and broaden understanding, and in promoting tolerance and coexistence, 

and in fostering an environment which is not conducive to incitement of terrorism, 

as well as in countering terrorist narratives,  

 Noting with concern that terrorist craft distorted narratives that are based on 

the misinterpretation and misrepresentation of religion to justify violence, which are 

utilized to recruit supporters and Foreign Terrorist Fighters (FTFs), mobilize 

resources, and garner support from sympathizers, in particular by exploiting 

information and communications technologies, including through the Internet and 

social media,  

 Noting as well the urgent need to globally counter the activities of the Islamic 

State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as Da’esh), Al-Qaida and associated 

individuals, groups, undertakings and entities to incite and recruit to commit 

terrorist acts and recalling, in this regard and as reflected in the Statement of  its 

President S/PRST/2016/6, its request to the Counter Terrorism Committee to present 

a proposal to the Security Council for a “comprehensive international framework” 

to effectively counter, in compliance with international law, the ways that ISIL 

(Da’esh), Al Qaida and associated individuals, groups, undertakings and entities use 

their narratives to encourage, motivate, and recruit others to commit terrorist acts,  

 1. Welcomes its document entitled “Comprehensive International 

Framework to Counter Terrorist Narratives” number S/2017/375 with recommended 

guidelines and good practices to effectively counter the ways that ISIL (Da’esh),

narratives to encourage, motivate, and recruit others to commit terrorist acts;  

 2. Stresses that Member States and all relevant United Nations entities 

should follow the subsequent guidelines while implementing the Comprehensive
