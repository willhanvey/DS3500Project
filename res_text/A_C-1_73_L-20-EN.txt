mission of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons determined that 

a specific incident in the Syrian Arab Republic involved or likely involved the use of 

chemicals as weapons, 

 Reaffirming the importance of the outcome of the Third Special Session of the 

Conference of the States Parties to Review the Operation of the Chemical Weapons 

Convention, held in The Hague from 8 to 19 April 2013 (the Third Review Conference), 

including its consensus final report, in which the Conference addressed all aspects of 

the Convention and made important recommendations on its continued implementation,  

 Emphasizing that the Third Review Conference welcomed the fact that the 

Convention is a unique multilateral agreement banning an entire category of weapons 

of mass destruction in a non-discriminatory and verifiable manner under strict and 

effective international control and noted with satisfaction that the Conventio n 

continues to be a remarkable success and an example of effective multilateralism,

its role as the international norm against chemical weapons, and that it constitutes a 

major contribution to:

 (b) Eliminating chemical weapons and preventing their re-emergence,  

 (c) The ultimate objective of general and complete disarmament under strict 

and effective international control,

use of chemical weapons,

information in the field of chemical activities among States parties for peaceful purposes 

in order to enhance the economic and technological development of all States parties,

chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances, emphasizing that any use of 

chemical weapons anywhere, at any time, by anyone, under any circumstances is 

unacceptable and is and would be a violation of international law and expressing it s 

strong conviction that those individuals responsible for the use of chemical weapons 

must and should be held accountable;  

 2. Condemns in the strongest possible terms  that chemical weapons have 

since 2012 been used in Iraq, Malaysia, the Syrian Arab Republic and the United 

Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, including as reported by the Joint 

Investigative Mechanism of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical 

Weapons and the United Nations in: 

 (a) Its reports of 24 August 20162 and 21 October 2016,3 which concluded that 

there was sufficient information to determine that the Syrian Arab Armed Forces were 

responsible for the attacks which released toxic substances in Talmenes, Syrian Arab 

Republic, on 21 April 2014, in Sarmin, Syrian Arab Republic, on 16 March 2015, and 

in Qmenas, Syrian Arab Republic, also on 16 March 2015, and that the so -called 

“Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant” used sulfur mustard in Marea, Syrian Arab 

Republic, on 21 August 2015; and

such weapons, and calls upon all States that have not yet done so to become parties 

to the Convention without delay; 

 6. Underlines the fact that the full, effective and non-discriminatory 

implementation of all articles of the Convention makes a major contributio n to 

international peace and security through the elimination of existing stockpiles of

for international cooperation for peaceful purposes in the field of chemical activities;

destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles and the destruction or conversion of 

chemical weapons production facilities in accordance with the provisions of the

purpose of the Convention;

 10. Recalls that the Third Special Session of the Conference of the States

weapons stockpiles, and also expressed determination that the destruction of all

with the full application of the relevant decisions that have been taken;

readiness of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and stresses 

that the full and effective implementation of all provisions of the Convention,

Chemical Weapons in verifying compliance with the provisions of the Convention as 

well as in promoting the timely and efficient accomplishment of all its objectives;  

 16. Expresses grave concern that, despite the verified destruction of all 27

complete in accordance with the Convention or Executive Council decision EC-M-

33/DEC.1 as well as with the conclusion of decision C-SS-4/DEC.3, of the Fourth 

Special Session of the Conference of the States Parties that the Syrian Arab Republic

production facilities, and underscores the importance of such full verification;
