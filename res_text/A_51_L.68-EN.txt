Having discussed the situation at its 91st and ____ plenary meetings on
12 and __ March 1997,

the Middle East Peace Process;

legal obligations and responsibilities under the Geneva Convention relative to
the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949, which is
applicable to all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967;
