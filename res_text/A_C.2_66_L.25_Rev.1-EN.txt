  Oil slick on Lebanese shores 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 61/194 of 20 December 2006, 62/188 of 19 December 
2007, 63/211 of 19 December 2008, 64/195 of 21 December 2009 and 65/147 of 
20 December 2010 on the oil slick on Lebanese shores, 

 Reaffirming the outcome of the United Nations Conference on the Human 
Environment, especially principle 7 of the Declaration of the Conference,1 in which 
States were requested to take all possible steps to prevent pollution of the seas, 

 Emphasizing the need to protect and preserve the marine environment in 
accordance with international law, 

 Taking into account the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and 
Development,2 especially principle 16, in which it was stipulated that the polluter 
should, in principle, bear the cost of pollution, and taking into account also chapter 
17 of Agenda 21,3 

 Noting with great concern the environmental disaster caused by the destruction 
by the Israeli Air Force on 15 July 2006 of the oil storage tanks in the direct vicinity 
of the Jiyeh electric power plant in Lebanon, resulting in an oil slick that covered 
the entirety of the Lebanese coastline, extended to the Syrian coastline and hindered 
efforts to achieve sustainable development, as already highlighted by the General 
Assembly in resolutions 61/194, 62/188, 63/211, 64/195 and 65/147,

 Noting that the Secretary-General expressed grave concern at the lack of any 
acknowledgment on the part of the Government of Israel of its responsibilities vis-à-
vis reparations and compensation to the Government and people of Lebanon and the 
Syrian Arab Republic affected by the oil spill, 

 Recalling that in paragraph 4 of its resolution 65/147, the General Assembly 
requested the Government of Israel to assume responsibility for prompt and 
adequate compensation to the Government of Lebanon and other countries directly 
affected by the oil slick, such as the Syrian Arab Republic, whose shores have been 
partially polluted, and recognizing the conclusion of the Secretary-General that this 
request of the Assembly has yet to be implemented, 

 Acknowledging that the Secretary-General concluded that this oil spill is not 
covered by any of the international oil spill compensation funds and thus merits 
special consideration, and recognizing that further consideration needs to be given 
to the option of securing the relevant compensation from the Government of Israel, 

 Noting the observation of the Secretary-General that the experience of the 
United Nations Compensation Commission in handling claims for compensation for 
environmental damage resulting from the unlawful invasion and occupation of 
Kuwait by Iraq may be of some value in terms of defining environmental damage in 
a case such as the present oil slick, in measuring and quantifying the damage 
sustained and in determining the amount of compensation payable in respect of it, 

 Noting again with appreciation the assistance offered by donor countries and 
international organizations for the clean-up operations and the early recovery and 
reconstruction of Lebanon through bilateral and multilateral channels, including the 
Athens Coordination Meeting on the response to the marine pollution incident in the 
Eastern Mediterranean, held on 17 August 2006, as well as the Stockholm 
Conference for Lebanon’s Early Recovery, held on 31 August 2006, 

 Acknowledging that the Secretary-General has welcomed the agreement of the 
Lebanon Recovery Fund to host the Eastern Mediterranean Oil Spill Restoration 
Trust Fund, under its existing mechanism, and expressing concern that to date no 
contributions have been made to the Trust Fund, 

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation 
of General Assembly resolution 65/147 on the oil slick on Lebanese shores;4 

 2. Reiterates, for the sixth consecutive year, its deep concern about the 
adverse implications of the destruction by the Israeli Air Force of the oil storage 
tanks in the direct vicinity of the Lebanese Jiyeh electric power plant, for the 
achievement of sustainable development in Lebanon; 

 3. Considers that the oil slick has heavily polluted the shores of Lebanon 
and partially polluted Syrian shores and consequently has had serious implications 
for livelihoods and the economy of Lebanon, owing to the adverse implications for 
natural resources, biodiversity, fisheries and tourism, and for human health, in the 
country; 

 4. Reiterates its request to the Government of Israel to assume 
responsibility for prompt and adequate compensation to the Government of Lebanon 
and other countries directly affected by the oil slick, such as the Syrian Arab

Republic whose shores have been partially polluted, for the costs of repairing the 
environmental damage caused by the destruction, including the restoration of the 
marine environment, in particular, in light of the conclusion contained in the report 
of the Secretary-General that there remains grave concern at the lack of 
implementation of the relevant provisions of the resolutions of the General 
Assembly on the subject vis-à-vis reparations and compensation to the Government 
and people of Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Republic affected by the oil spill; 

 5. Requests the Secretary-General to give further consideration to the option 
of securing the relevant compensation from the Government of Israel; 

 6. Also requests the Secretary-General to explore the value of the 
experience of the United Nations Compensation Commission in terms of defining 
environmental damage in a case such as the present oil slick, in measuring and 
quantifying the damage sustained and in determining the amount of compensation 
payable in respect of it; 

 7. Reiterates its appreciation for the efforts of the Government of Lebanon 
and those of Member States, regional and international organizations, regional and 
international financial institutions, non-governmental organizations and the private 
sector in the initiation of clean-up and rehabilitation operations on the polluted 
shores, and encourages Member States and the above-mentioned entities to continue 
their financial and technical support to the Government of Lebanon towards 
achieving the completion of clean-up and rehabilitation operations, with the aim of 
preserving the ecosystem of Lebanon and that of the Eastern Mediterranean Basin; 

 8. Welcomes the agreement with the Lebanon Recovery Fund to host the 
Eastern Mediterranean Oil Spill Restoration Trust Fund, based on voluntary 
contributions, to provide assistance and support to the States directly adversely 
affected in their integrated environmentally sound management, from clean-up to 
safe disposal of oily waste, of this environmental disaster resulting from the 
destruction of the oil storage tanks at the Jiyeh electric power plant; 

 9. Notes that in his report the Secretary-General urged Member States, 
international organizations, international and regional financial institutions, 
non-governmental organizations and the private sector to continue their support for 
Lebanon in this matter, in particular for rehabilitation activities on the Lebanese 
coast and in the broader recovery efforts, and stated that such international effort 
should be intensified, since Lebanon is still engaged in the treatment of wastes and 
the monitoring of recovery, and reiterates its invitation to States and the 
international donor community to make voluntary financial contributions to the 
Trust Fund, and in this regard requests the Secretary-General to mobilize 
international technical and financial assistance, in order to ensure that the Trust 
Fund has sufficient and adequate resources; 

 10. Recognizes the multidimensionality of the adverse impact of the oil slick, 
and requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its sixty- 
seventh session a report on the implementation of the present resolution under the 
item entitled “Sustainable development”.
