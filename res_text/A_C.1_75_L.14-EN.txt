 The General Assembly, 

 Guided by the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United 

Nations and the rules of international humanitarian law,  

 Recalling its resolutions 62/30 of 5 December 2007, 63/54 of 2 December 2008, 

65/55 of 8 December 2010, 67/36 of 3 December 2012, 69/57 of 2 December 2014, 

71/70 of 5 December 2016 and 73/38 of 5 December 2018, 

 Determined to promote multilateralism as an essential means to carry forward 

negotiations on arms regulation and disarmament,  

 Taking note of the opinions expressed by Member States and relevant international 

organizations on the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing 

depleted uranium, as reflected in the reports submitted by the Secretary-General 

pursuant to resolutions 62/30, 63/54, 65/55, 67/36, 69/57, 71/70 and 73/38,1 

 Recognizing the importance of implementing, as appropriate, the recommendations 

of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations Environment 

Programme and the World Health Organization to mitigate potential hazards to human 

beings and the environment from the contamination of territories with depleted 

uranium residues, 

 Considering that studies conducted so far by relevant international organizations 

have not provided a detailed enough account of the magnitude of the potential long-

term effects on human beings and the environment of the use of armaments and 

ammunitions containing depleted uranium,

 Recalling that the United Nations Environment Programme, in its report to the 

Secretary-General on the subject,2 affirms that major scientific uncertainties persist 

regarding the long-term environmental impacts of depleted uranium, particularly with 

respect to long-term groundwater contamination, and calls for a precautionary 

approach to the use of depleted uranium, 

 Convinced that, as humankind becomes more aware of the need to take 

immediate measures to protect the environment, any event that could jeopardize such 

efforts requires urgent attention to implement the required measures,  

 Noting that further research should be done to assess the health risks and 

environmental impact of the use of arms and ammunitions containing depleted 

uranium in conflict situations, 

 Noting also the technical and financial barriers faced by affected States seeking 

to implement post-conflict remedial measures that meet international standards for 

radioactive waste management for locations, infrastructure and materiel contaminated 

by arms and ammunitions containing depleted uranium,  

 Taking into consideration the potential harmful effects of the use of armaments 

and ammunitions containing depleted uranium on human health and the environment, 

and the ongoing concerns of affected States and communities, health experts and civil 

society about such effects, 

 1. Expresses its appreciation to the Member States and international 

organizations that submitted their views to the Secretary-General pursuant to 

resolution 73/38 and previous resolutions on the subject; 

 2. Invites Member States and relevant international organizations, particularly 

those that have not yet done so, to communicate to the Secretary-General their views 

on the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium;  

 3. Requests the Secretary-General to request relevant international 

organizations to update and complete, as appropriate, their studies and research on 

the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium on 

human health and the environment; 

 4. Encourages Member States, particularly the affected States, as necessary, 

to facilitate the studies and research referred to in paragraph 3 above; 

 5. Also encourages Member States to follow closely the development of the 

studies and research referred to in paragraph 3 above; 

 6. Invites Member States that have used armaments and ammunitions 

containing depleted uranium in armed conflicts to provide the relevant authorities of 

affected States, upon request, with information, as detailed as possible, about the 

location of the areas of use and the amounts used, with the objective of facilitating 

the assessment and clearance of such areas; 

 7. Encourages Member States in a position to do so to provide assistance to 

States affected by the use of arms and ammunitions containing depleted uranium, in 

particular in identifying and managing contaminated sites and material;  

 8. Requests the Secretary-General to submit an updated report on the subject 

to the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session, reflecting the information 

submitted by Member States and relevant international organizations, including the 

information submitted pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 above;
