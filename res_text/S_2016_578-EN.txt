  Russian Federation and United States of America: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Noting with concern that the situation in the Middle East is tense and is likely 

to remain so, unless and until a comprehensive settlement covering all aspects of the 

Middle East problem can be reached,  

 Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations 

Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) of 8 June 2016 (S/2016/520), and also 

reaffirming its resolution 1308 (2000) of 17 July 2000,  

 Stressing that both parties must abide by the terms of the 1974 Disengagement 

of Forces Agreement between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic and scrupulously 

observe the ceasefire, 

 Concurring with the Secretary-General’s findings that the ongoing military 

activities conducted by any actor in the area of separation continue to have the 

potential to escalate tensions between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic, 

jeopardize the ceasefire between the two countries, and pose a risk to the local 

civilian population and United Nations personnel on the ground,  

 Expressing grave concern at all violations of the Disengagement of Forces 

Agreement, 

 Stressing that there should be no military forces in the area of separation other 

than those of UNDOF, 

 Strongly condemning the continued fighting in the area of separation, calling 

on all parties to the Syrian domestic conflict to cease military actions in the UNDOF 

area of operations and to respect international humanitarian law,  

 Condemning the use of heavy weapons by both the Syrian armed forces and 

armed groups in the ongoing Syrian conflict in the area of separation, including the 

use of tanks by the Syrian armed forces and opposition during clashes,  

 Echoing the Secretary-General’s call upon all parties to the Syrian domestic 

conflict to cease military actions throughout the country, including in the UNDOF 

area of operations, 

 Reaffirming its readiness to consider listing individuals, groups, undertakings 

and entities providing support to ISIL or to the Al-Nusra Front, including those who 

are financing, arming, planning, or recruiting for ISIL or the Al-Nusra Front and all 

other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with ISIL and

Al-Qaida under the ISIL (Da’esh) and Al-Qaida sanctions regime, including those 

participating in or otherwise supporting attacks against United Nations peacekeepers, 

 Recognizing the necessity of efforts to flexibly adjust UNDOF’s posture on a 

temporary basis to minimize the security risk to UN personnel as UNDOF continues 

to implement its mandate, while emphasizing that the ultimate goal is for the 

peacekeepers to return to their positions in UNDOF’s area of operations as soon as 

practicable,  

 Emphasizing the importance of Security Council and troop-contributing 

countries having access to reports and information related to UNDOF’s current 

temporary configuration, and reinforcing that such information assists the Security 

Council with evaluating, mandating and reviewing UNDOF and with effective 

consultation with troop-contributing countries,  

 Underscoring the need for UNDOF to have at its disposal all necessary means 

and resources to carry out its mandate safely and securely, including technology and 

equipment to enhance its observation of the area of separation and the ceasefire line, 

and to improve force protection, as appropriate, and recalling that the theft of 

United Nations weapons and ammunition, vehicles and other assets, and the looting 

and destruction of United Nations facilities, are unacceptable,  

 Expressing its profound appreciation to UNDOF’s military and civilian 

personnel, including those from Observer Group Golan, for their service and 

continued contribution, in an increasingly challenging operating environment, 

underscoring the important contribution UNDOF’s continued presence makes to 

peace and security in the Middle East, welcoming steps taken to enhance the safety 

and security of UNDOF, including Observer Group Golan personnel, and stressing 

the need for continued vigilance to ensure the safety and security of UNDOF and 

Observer Group Golan personnel, 

 Strongly condemning incidents threatening the safety and security of United 

Nations personnel in recent months,  

 Expressing its appreciation to UNDOF for the efforts made to upgrade and 

expand its positions on Mount Hermon, including the establishment of a new 

position, 

 Taking note of the Secretary-General’s plan for UNDOF to return 

incrementally to vacated positions, starting with Camp Faouar on the Bravo side, 

conditions permitting, given improvements in security in the northern part of the 

area of separation.
