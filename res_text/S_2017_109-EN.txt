 The Security Council,  

 Recalling its previous resolutions and statements of its President concerning 

Sudan,  

 Reaffirming its commitment to the cause of peace throughout Sudan, to the 

sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Sudan, and to the full 

and timely implementation of resolution 1591 (2005), recalling the importance of 

the principles of good neighbourliness, non-interference and cooperation in the 

relations among States in the region, and further recalling that the Government of 

Sudan bears the primary responsibility for protecting all populations within its 

territory, with respect for the rule of law, international human rights law and 

international humanitarian law,  

 Noting the importance of the work of the African Union High-Level 

Implementation Panel (AUHIP), the aims of the Doha Document for Peace in 

Darfur (DDPD), and the stated commitment of the Government of Sudan to an 

inclusive national dialogue building on the AUHIP’s ongoing peace efforts, 

welcoming the African Union Peace and Security Council’s decision to extend the 

AUHIP’s mandate for another year, and further welcoming the AU Roadmap 

Agreement, signed by both the Government and the opposition, and urging the 

signatory groups to implement the Roadmap by working towards a negotiated 

cessation of hostilities and an open and inclusive political dialogue,  

 Reiterating the need for an end to the violence and continued violations and 

abuses in Darfur, underscoring the importance of fully addressing the root causes of 

the conflict in the search for a sustainable peace, and recognizing that the Darfur 

conflict cannot be resolved militarily and a durable solution can only be obtained 

through an inclusive political process,  

 Noting that the conflict between the Government and armed groups has mostly 

become limited to the Jebel Marra region and acknowledging an overall reduction in 

violence, while remaining particularly concerned at the violence and insecurity that 

remains, including intercommunal violence, militia activity, banditry, and fighting 

between the government and armed groups, expressing concern that such violence 

and insecurity continues to negatively affect civilians and has contributed to an 

increase in the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) observed in 2016, and 

that the Government of Sudan continues to restrict humanitarian access to conflict

these acts may amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity under  international 

law,  

 Expressing concern about the external links, in particular military, between 

non-signatory armed groups in Darfur and groups outside Darfur, demanding that 

direct or indirect military support for such armed groups in Darfur ceases, an d

the Sudan Liberation Army-Abdul Wahid (SLA/AW) to join the AU-led peace 

negotiations, as a first step towards a comprehensive and sustainable peace 

agreement, and recalling its willingness to consider targeted sanctions against 

individuals or entities who impede the peace process, constitute a threat to stability

affiliated armed groups, involving the routine movement of weapons and 

ammunition into Darfur, without prior authorization of the 1591 committee, 

established pursuant to paragraph 3 of resolution 1591 (the Committee), 

 Demanding an immediate and complete cessation by all parties to the armed

call on all parties in Darfur to cooperate fully with its mission, including by

effective efforts to ensure accountability for violations and abuses of human rights 

and violations of international humanitarian law, by whomsoever  perpetrated,  

 Noting that acts of hostility, violence or intimidation against the civilian 

population, including IDPs, in Darfur, endanger or undermine the parties’ 

commitment to a complete and durable cessation of hostilities, and would be 

inconsistent with the aims of the DDPD,

international peace and security in the region,

throughout the length of its mandate, insists that the Government of Sudan remove 

all restrictions, limitations and bureaucratic impediments imposed on the work of 

the Panel of Experts, including by issuing timely multiple -entry visas to all 

members of the Panel of Experts for the duration of its mandate, and by waiving the 

requirement of Darfur travel permits for said Panel members and enhance its 

cooperation and information sharing with the Panel, and stresses that it will monitor 

the degree of cooperation of the Government of Sudan on such matters;

important milestone in determining a practicable way forward towards a cessation

 8. Expresses its concern that the direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer to 

Sudan of technical assistance and support, including training, financial or other 

assistance and the provision of spare parts, weapons systems and related materiel, 

could be used by the Government of Sudan to support military aircraft being used in 

violation of resolutions 1556 (2004) and 1591 (2005), including those aircraft 

identified by the panel, and urges all States to be mindful of this risk in light of the

 10. Calls upon the Government of Sudan to address the illicit transfer, 

destabilizing accumulation, and misuse of small arms and light weapons in Darfur, 

which also contributes to instability in the region, and further to ensure the safe and 

effective management, storage and security of their stockpiles of small arms  and 

light weapons, and the collection and/or destruction of surplus, seized, unmarked, or 

illicitly held weapons and ammunition, and calls upon the Government of Sudan 

and other signatories to swiftly fulfil their commitments under the DDPD to 

implement and complete disarmament, demobilization and reintegration;  

 11. Expresses its concern that certain items continue to be converted for 

military purposes and transferred to Darfur, and urges all States to be mindful of 

this risk in light of the measures contained in resolution 1591 (2005);  

 

  Implementation

2035 (2012) and directs the Committee, in line with its mandate and guidelines, to 

consult as soon as possible with any Member State about which the Committee 

deems there is credible information that provides reasonable grounds to believe the 

State is facilitating such violations or any other acts of non-compliance with these 

measures;  

 13. Expresses its concern that the travel ban and asset freeze on designated 

individuals is not being implemented by all Member States, requests the Panel to 

share with the Committee any information regarding possible non-compliance with 

the travel ban and asset freeze as soon as possible, and directs the Committee to 

respond effectively to any reports of non-compliance by Member States with 

paragraph 3 of resolution 1591 (2005) and resolution 1672 (2006), including by 

engaging immediately with all relevant parties;

ensuring full compliance;  

 17. Regrets that some individuals of the Government of Sudan and armed 

groups in Darfur continue to commit violence against civilians, impede the peace 

process, and disregard the demands of the Council, expresses its intention to impose 

targeted sanctions against individuals and entities that meet the listing criteria of 

paragraph 3 (c) of resolution 1591 (2005), and encourages the Panel of Experts, in 

coordination with the Joint African Union/United Nations Mediation, to provide to

expresses its intention to impose targeted sanctions on individuals and entities who 

plan, sponsor or participate in such attacks;
