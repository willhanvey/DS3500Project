Countries of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which

official development assistance for all developing countries with a view to realizing
the 0.7 per cent target,

resolution 122 (V) of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, in
order to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to supplement the activities
undertaken by the least developed countries themselves;

adversely affect the share of the least developed countries in the indicative
planning figures of the United Nations Development Programme to be considered for
the third programming cycle;

the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which is to act as the

DRAFT RESOLUTION XII

Immediate measures in favour of the seriously affected countries 32/

The General Assembly,

Recal1in~ that by its resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI) of 1 May 1974 it
decided to launch a special programme to provide emergency relief and development
assistance to the developing countries most seriously affected by the economic
crisis, as a matter of urgency and for the period of time necessary, at least until
the end of the Second United Nations Development Decade, to help them to overcome
their difficulties and to achieve self-sustaininG development,

Recalling also that its resolution 3362 (S-VII) of 16 September 1975 on
development and international economic co-operation called for donor countries and
international organizations to undertake specific measures to assist the most
seriously affected countries in helping them to meet their serious ba1ance-of-
payments deficits,

Noting with concern that the special programme in general remained largely
unfulfilled,

Mindful of the inadequacy of concessiona1 multilateral and bilateral assistance
to developing countries identified as most seriously affected, despite efforts made
by the international community,

Noting with deep concern the deterioration of the economic and financial
situation of those developing countries which, given their low per capita income
as a reflection of relative poverty, low productivity and low level of technology
and development, merit consideration as most seriously affected by the current
economic crisis caused by sharp increases in the prices of their essential imports,

1. Reguests the Secretary-General, in close co-operation with the appropriate
agencies, organs and bodies of the United Nations system, to review and study
speedily the situation of those developing countries, which, given their low
per capita income as a reflection of relative poverty, low productivity and low
level of technology and development, merit consideration as most seriously affected
by the current economic crisis caused by sharp increases in the prices of their
essential imports, and to submit a preliminary report to the Committeed:L the Whole
Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 at its first substantive
session in 1980, as well as to the Preparatory Committee for the New International
Development Strategy at its fourth session and to include a final report in the
analytical report to the General Assembly at its special session in 1980;

2. Calls upon all donor countries, in the meantime, to consider extending
relief and assistance to those countries which mzy be most seriously affected by
the current economic crisis, bearing in mind immediate ba1ance-of-payment and
development needs; to this end, urgent consideration should be given, inter alia,
to the following measures:

1 MaY1974.

(a) tlaking their best efforts to increase substanti8~ly financial assistance
on grant or highly concessional terms in the context of the commitments entered
into by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development at its fifth
session:

(b) Developed countries which have not yet done so should take steps as
quickly as possible to apply the conclusions approved under part A of Trade and
Development Board resolution 165 (S-IX) of 11 March 1978; 33/

(c) Provision of financial assistance on favourable terms, inter alia, to
meet their food deficit and agricultural development requirements;

(d) Industrialization efforts should receive a due share of the resources
transferred to these countries, taking into account their development priorities;

3. Notes that the International 110netary Fund is studying the possibility of
establishing an interest subsidy for the Supplementary Financing Facility, that
the Development Committee has requested the Executive Board of the Fund to give
attention to developing ways and means of lowering the interest costs of the
Supplementary Financing Facility and that the Fund has recently extended the
maturities of drawings on the Extended Financing Facility and invites the Fund to
give consideration to proposals in those areas;

4. Invites the International 110netary Fund to take into account, within the
context of its financing facilities and ruidelines, the adverse balance-of-payments
effects caused by the rise in the food import bills of those countries which may be
most seriously affected by the current economic crisis;

5. Invites the multilateral development and financial institutions to give
special attention to the development and immediate balance-of-payments needs of
those countries which may be most seriously affected by the current economic cr1S1S.
In that context, appropriate bodies in the Fund and the Bank are invited to continue
to consider within their respective fields of competence the relevant proposals
contained in the Outline for a Programme of Action on International Monetary
Reform adopted by the Group of Seventy-seven at its ministerial meeting held at
Belgrade on 29 September 1979.
