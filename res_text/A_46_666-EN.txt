7. The First Committee recommends to the Qeneral  Assembly the adoption of
the following draft resolution:

m Previous resolutions which identify the complete cessation of
nuclear-weapon  tests and a comprehensive test ban as one of the basic
objectives in rhe f ield of  diaarmement,

a that ~~ nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought,C--

&&~B&I the improved relationship between the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republic~!~  and the United States of America and their consequent announcements

KQ$.&J  the decline, in comparison with previous yeafar in the number of
nuclear teats conducted in 1990,

Convincoa  that an end to nuclear testing by all States in all
environments for all time is an essential step in order to prevent the
qualitative improvement and development of nuclear weapons and their further
proliferation and to contribute, along with other concurrent efforts to reduce
nuclear arms, to the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons,

w concerns expressed about the environment A and health risks
awociated  with underground nuclear testing,

Convincea  that the most effective way to achieve an end to nuclear
testing is through the conclusion, at an early date, of a verifiable,
comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty that will attract the adherence of all
States,

Takinainto the undertakings by the original parties to the 1963
Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapons Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and
under Water 51 to seek to achieve the early discontinuance of all test
explosions of nuclear wlsapons  for all time and also noting the reiteration of
this commitment in the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons, 61

-with the work being undertakon within the Conference
on Disarmament by the Ad Hoc Qroup of Scientific Enherta to Consider
International Cooperative Measures to Detect and Identify Seismic Events, and
