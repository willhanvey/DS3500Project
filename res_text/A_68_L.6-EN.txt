  Cuba: draft resolution 
 
 

  Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial 
embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Determined to encourage strict compliance with the purposes and principles 
enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, 

 Reaffirming, among other principles, the sovereign equality of States, 
non-intervention and non-interference in their internal affairs and freedom of 
international trade and navigation, which are also enshrined in many international 
legal instruments, 

 Recalling the statements of the Heads of State or Government at the 
Ibero-American Summits concerning the need to eliminate the unilateral application 
of economic and trade measures by one State against another that affect the free 
flow of international trade, 

 Concerned about the continued promulgation and application by Member 
States of laws and regulations, such as that promulgated on 12 March 1996 known 
as “the Helms-Burton Act”, the extraterritorial effects of which affect the 
sovereignty of other States, the legitimate interests of entities or persons under their 
jurisdiction and the freedom of trade and navigation, 

 Taking note of declarations and resolutions of different intergovernmental 
forums, bodies and Governments that express the rejection by the international 
community and public opinion of the promulgation and application of measures of 
the kind referred to above, 

 Recalling its resolutions 47/19 of 24 November 1992, 48/16 of 3 November 
1993, 49/9 of 26 October 1994, 50/10 of 2 November 1995, 51/17 of 12 November 
1996, 52/10 of 5 November 1997, 53/4 of 14 October 1998, 54/21 of 9 November 
1999, 55/20 of 9 November 2000, 56/9 of 27 November 2001, 57/11 of 
12 November 2002, 58/7 of 4 November 2003, 59/11 of 28 October 2004, 60/12 of 
8 November 2005, 61/11 of 8 November 2006, 62/3 of 30 October 2007, 63/7 of

29 October 2008, 64/6 of 28 October 2009, 65/6 of 26 October 2010, 66/6 of 
25 October 2011 and 67/4 of 13 November 2012, 

 Concerned that, since the adoption of its resolutions 47/19, 48/16, 49/9, 50/10, 
51/17, 52/10, 53/4, 54/21, 55/20, 56/9, 57/11, 58/7, 59/11, 60/12, 61/11, 62/3, 63/7, 
64/6, 65/6, 66/6 and 67/4, further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and 
extending the economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue 
to be promulgated and applied, and concerned also about the adverse effects of such 
measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries,  

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation 
of resolution 67/4;1 

 2. Reiterates its call upon all States to refrain from promulgating and 
applying laws and measures of the kind referred to in the preamble to the present 
resolution, in conformity with their obligations under the Charter of the United 
Nations and international law, which, inter alia, reaffirm the freedom of trade and 
navigation; 

 3. Once again urges States that have and continue to apply such laws and 
measures to take the necessary steps to repeal or invalidate them as soon as possible 
in accordance with their legal regime; 

 4. Requests the Secretary-General, in consultation with the appropriate 
organs and agencies of the United Nations system, to prepare a report on the 
implementation of the present resolution in the light of the purposes and principles 
of the Charter and international law and to submit it to the General Assembly at its 
sixty-ninth session; 

 5. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-ninth session the 
item entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo 
imposed by the United States of America against Cuba”.
