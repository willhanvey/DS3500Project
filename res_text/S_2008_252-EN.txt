organizations in matters relating to the maintenance of peace and security and 
consistent with Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations, can improve 
collective security, 

 Welcoming the role of the African Union in efforts to settle conflicts in the 
African Continent and expressing its support for the peace initiatives conducted by 
the African Union, and through subregional organizations, 

 Emphasizing the need to strengthen the role of the United Nations in the 
prevention of armed conflicts, and stressing utility of developing effective 
partnerships between the United Nations and regional organizations, in particular 
the African Union, in order to enable early responses to disputes and emerging 
crises in Africa, and in this regard noting with interest the Secretary-General’s 
proposal of conducting joint reviews by the United Nations and regional 
organizations of the state of peace and security and of mediation endeavours, 
particularly in Africa where joint mediation is being undertaken, 

 Recognizing that regional organizations are well positioned to understand the 
root causes of armed conflicts owing to their knowledge of the region which can be 
a benefit for their efforts to influence the prevention or resolution of these conflicts, 

 Stressing the importance of further strengthening cooperation with the African 
Union in order to assist building its capacity to deal with common collective 
security challenges in Africa, including through the African Union’s commitment of 
rapid and appropriate responses to emerging crises situations, and the development 
of effective strategies for conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peacebuilding,

08-30805 2 
 

 Recalling the resolve of Heads of State and Government of the 2005 World 
Summit to expand, as appropriate, the involvement of regional organizations in the 
work of the Security Council, and to ensure that regional organizations that have a 
capacity for the prevention of armed conflict or peacekeeping consider the option of 
placing such capacity in the framework of the United Nations Standby 
Arrangements System,

subregional organizations in conflict prevention and crisis management, and in post-

between the United Nations and regional organizations, in particular the African

knowledge to enhance the capacity of the African Union’s Peace Support Operations
