  Cuba:* draft resolution  
 
 

  Promotion of equitable geographical distribution in the 
membership of the human rights treaty bodies 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions on this question, 

 Reaffirming the importance of the goal of universal ratification of the United 
Nations human rights instruments, 

 Welcoming the significant increase in the number of ratifications of United 
Nations human rights instruments, and the movement of some treaties towards 
universal ratification, 

 Reiterating the importance of the effective functioning of treaty bodies 
established pursuant to United Nations human rights instruments for the full and 
effective implementation of those instruments, 

 Recognizing that the equitable geographical distribution of membership is an 
essential requirement for the effective functioning of the treaty bodies, 

 Recalling that, with regard to the election of the members of the human rights 
treaty bodies, the General Assembly and the former Commission on Human Rights 
recognized the importance of giving consideration in their membership to equitable 
geographical distribution, gender balance and representation of the principal legal 
systems and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and shall serve in 
their personal capacity, and shall be of high moral character, acknowledged 
impartiality and recognized competence in the field of human rights, 

 
 

 * On behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the Movement of 
Non-Aligned Countries. 



A/C.3/68/L.38  
 

13-54127 2/3 
 

 Reaffirming the significance of national and regional particularities and 
various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds, as well as of different 
political, economic and legal systems, 

 Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on the promotion of 
equitable geographical distribution in the membership of the human rights treaty 
bodies,1 

 Recognizing that the United Nations pursues multilingualism as a means of 
promoting, protecting and preserving diversity of languages and cultures globally 
and that genuine multilingualism promotes unity in diversity and international 
understanding, 

 Recalling that the General Assembly and the former Commission on Human 
Rights encouraged States parties to United Nations human rights treaties, 
individually and through meetings of States parties, to consider how to give better 
effect, inter alia, to the principle of equitable geographical distribution in the 
membership of treaty bodies, 

 Expressing concern at the regional imbalance in the current composition of the 
membership of the human rights treaty bodies, as indicated in the report of the 
Secretary-General,  

 Reaffirming the importance of increasing efforts to address that imbalance,  

 Convinced that the goal of equitable geographical distribution in the 
membership of human rights treaty bodies is perfectly compatible and can be fully 
realized and achieved in harmony with the need to achieve gender balance and the 
representation of the principal legal systems in those bodies and the high moral 
character, acknowledged impartiality and recognized competence in the field of 
human rights of their members, 

 1. Reiterates that the States parties to the United Nations human rights 
instruments should take into account, in their nomination of members to the human 
rights treaty bodies, that these committees shall be composed of persons of high 
moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights, 
consideration being given to the usefulness of the participation of some persons 
having legal experience, and to equal representation of women and men, and that 
members shall serve in their personal capacity, and also reiterates that, in the 
elections to the human rights treaty bodies, consideration shall be given to equitable 
geographical distribution of membership and to the representation of the different 
forms of civilization and of the principal legal systems; 

 2. Urges the States parties to the United Nations human rights instruments, 
including the bureau members, to include this matter in the agenda of each meeting 
and/or conference of States parties to those instruments in order to initiate a debate 
on ways and means to ensure equitable geographical distribution in the membership 
of the human rights treaty bodies, based on previous recommendations of the 
Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and Social Council and the 
provisions of the present resolution;  

 3. Encourages the States parties to the United Nations human rights 
instruments to consider and adopt concrete actions, inter alia, the possible

establishment of quotas by geographical region for membership of the treaty bodies, 
thereby ensuring the paramount objective of equitable geographical distribution in 
the membership of those human rights bodies; 

 4. Recommends, when considering the possible allocation of seats on each 
treaty body on a regional basis, the introduction of flexible procedures that 
encompass the following criteria: 

 (a) Each of the five regional groups established by the General Assembly is 
allocated seats on each treaty body in equivalent proportion to the number of States 
parties to the instrument in that group; 

 (b) There must be provision for periodic revisions of the allocation of seats 
in order to reflect relative changes in the level of treaty ratification in each regional 
group; 

 (c) Automatic periodic revisions should be envisaged in order to avoid 
amending the text of the instrument when the quotas are revised; 

 5. Stresses that the process needed to achieve the goal of equitable 
geographical distribution in the membership of human rights treaty bodies can 
contribute to raising awareness of the importance of gender balance, the 
representation of the principal legal systems and the principle that the members of 
the treaty bodies shall be elected and shall serve in their personal capacity, and shall 
be of high moral character, acknowledged impartiality and recognized competence 
in the field of human rights; 

 6. Requests the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, to submit to the General 
Assembly at its seventieth session a comprehensive updated report in this regard, 
including information on any steps taken by States parties at meetings or 
conferences of States parties to address the matter of equitable geographical 
distribution in the membership of the human rights treaty bodies, as well as concrete 
recommendations on the implementation of the present resolution; 

 7. Decides to continue its consideration of the question at its seventieth 
session under the item entitled “Promotion and protection of human rights”.
