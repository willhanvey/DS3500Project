Ethiopia, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Horn of Africa, and the 

United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA),  

 Acknowledging that over the course of the eight years since establishment of 

UNISFA, the mission has been able to stabilize and demilitarize the Abyei Are a and 

that UNISFA is now an interim security force with no viable exit strategy, and in this 

regard, taking note of the need to reconfigure the mission in order to create the space 

for a viable political process that would also serve as an exit strategy,

including by its ongoing facilitation of peaceful migration throughout the Abyei Area, 

conflict prevention, mediation and deterrence, and strongly underscoring the 

unacceptability of any attack on United Nations personnel, and reiterating that such 

attacks, which may constitute a war crime, should be swiftly and thoroughly 

investigated, and that those responsible should be held to account,  

 Recalling that the Security Council welcomed in resolution 2205 (2015) the 

decision of the Secretary-General to appoint a civilian head of mission,  

 Bearing in mind that people in the Abyei Area continue to rely on humanitarian 

assistance, that access for humanitarian organizations to reach people in need remains 

of crucial importance, and that humanitarian actors continue to provide assistance to 

182,000 people in the Abyei Area, 

 Recalling resolution 2378 (2017) and its request of the Secretary-General to 

ensure that data related to the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations, including

mission operations, based on clear and well-identified benchmarks, and further 

recalling resolution 2436 (2018) and its request of the Secretary-General to ensure

predicated on objective performance data,  

 Further recalling resolutions 1325 (2000) and subsequent resolutions on
