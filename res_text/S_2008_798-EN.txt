  Draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its resolutions 955 (1994) of 8 November 1994, 1165 (1998) of 
30 April 1998, 1329 (2000) of 30 November 2000, 1411 (2002) of 17 May 2002, 
1431 (2002) of 14 August 2002, 

 Recalling in particular that resolution 1503 (2003) of 28 August 2003 called 
upon the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (the International Tribunal) to 
take all possible measures to complete all trial activities at first instance by the end 
of 2008 and to complete all work in 2010, and that resolution 1534 (2004) of 
26 March 2004 emphasized the importance of fully implementing the International 
Tribunal’s completion strategy, 

 Taking note of the letter to the President of the Council from the Secretary-
General dated 18 December 2008, attaching the letter to him from the President of 
the International Tribunal dated 10 December 2008 (S/2008/798), and having 
considered the proposals made by the President of the International Tribunal,  

 Noting that two permanent judges currently serving at the Tribunal will resign 
by the end of 2008, and that three other permanent judges have indicated their 
intention to resign upon the completion of their respective cases, and that their 
replacement would not be necessary if the International Tribunal is authorized to 
assign more ad litem judges to cases, 

 Convinced of the advisability of allowing the Secretary-General to appoint 
additional ad litem Judges to the nine ad litem Judges authorized by the Statute, as a 
temporary measure to enable the International Tribunal to complete trials and 
conduct additional trials as soon as possible in order to meet its completion strategy, 

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 

 1. Decides that the Secretary-General may appoint, within existing 
resources, additional ad litem Judges upon request of the President of the 
International Tribunal in order to complete existing trials or conduct additional 
trials, notwithstanding that the total number of ad litem Judges appointed to the 
Chambers will from time to time temporarily exceed the maximum of nine provided 
for in article 11, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the International Tribunal, to a 
maximum of twelve at any one time, returning to a maximum of nine by 
31 December 2009;

 2. Decides to amend article 11, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the 
International Tribunal as set out in the annex to this resolution; 

 3. Decides to remain seized of the matter. 
 

  Annex 
Article 11: Composition of the Chambers 
 

2. Each Trial Chamber may be divided into sections of three judges each. A 
section of a Trial Chamber shall have the same powers and responsibilities as a Trial 
Chamber under the present Statute and shall render judgment in accordance with the 
same rules.
