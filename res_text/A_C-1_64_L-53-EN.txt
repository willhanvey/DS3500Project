throughout the world and to assure their destruction, 

 Wishing to do the utmost in ensuring assistance for the care and rehabilitation, 
including the social and economic reintegration, of mine victims,

Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of 
Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction,1
