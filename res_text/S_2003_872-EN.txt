Noting that the peace process has now entered its crucial phase of demarcation
and emphasizing the importance of ensuring expeditious implementation of the

Eritrea and the implications this could have on the peace process, and calling on
Member States to continue to provide prompt and generous support for humanitarian
operations in Ethiopia and Eritrea,

movement and remove with immediate effect any and all restrictions on, and
impediments to the work of, UNMEE and its staff in the discharge of its mandate,

Expressing concern regarding the reported increase in incidents of incursions
at the local level into the Temporary Security Zone (TSZ), and calling on both
