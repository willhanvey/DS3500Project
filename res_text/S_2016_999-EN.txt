 The Security Council,  

 Recalling its previous relevant resolutions, including resolution 825 (1993),

1718 (2006), 1874 (2009), 2087 (2013), 2094 (2013) and 2270 (2016), and at the 

challenge such a test constitutes to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 

Weapons (“the NPT”) and to international efforts aimed at strengthening the global 

regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and the danger it poses to peace 

and stability in the region and beyond,  

 Underlining once again the importance that the DPRK respond to other

 Underlining also that measures imposed by this resolution are not intended to 

have adverse humanitarian consequences for the civi lian population of the DPRK,
