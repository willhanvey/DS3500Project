  Draft resolution II  

  Question of Tokelau  
 

 

 The General Assembly,  

 Having considered the question of Tokelau,  

 Taking note of the chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the 

Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of 

Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for 2015 relating to Tokelau,
1
  

 Recalling its resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, containing the 

Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, and 

all resolutions and decisions of the United Nations relating to Non -Self-Governing 

Territories, in particular General Assembly resolution 70/101 of 9 December 2015,  

 Noting with appreciation the continuing exemplary cooperation of New 

Zealand as the administering Power with regard to the work of the Special 

Committee relating to Tokelau and its readiness to permit access by United Nations 

visiting missions to the Territory,  

 Noting with appreciation also the collaborative contribution to the development 

of Tokelau by New Zealand and the specialized agencies and other organizations of 

the United Nations system, in particular the United Nations Development Programme ,  

 Noting that, as a small island Territory, Tokelau exemplifies the situation of 

most remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories and that, as a case study pointing to 

successful cooperation for decolonization, Tokelau has wider significance for the 

United Nations as it seeks to complete its work in decolonization,   

 Recalling the status of Tokelau as an associate member of the Food and 

Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,  

 Cognizant that New Zealand and Tokelau signed, on 21 November 2003, a 

document entitled “Joint statement of the principles of partnership”, which sets out 

the rights and responsibilities of the two partners,   

 Bearing in mind the decision of the General Fono at its meeting in November 

2003, following extensive consultations undertaken in all three villages, to explore 

formally with New Zealand the option of self-government in free association, its 

decision in August 2005 to hold in February 2006 a referendum on self-

determination on the basis of a draft constitution for Tokelau and a draft treaty of 

free association with New Zealand, and its subsequent decision to hold a further 

referendum in October 2007, and bearing in mind also that the two r eferendums did 

not produce the two-thirds majority of valid votes cast required by the General Fono 

to change the status of Tokelau from that of a Non-Self-Governing Territory under 

the administration of New Zealand,  

 Recalling the holding of free and fair elections in the Territory in January 2014,

 Noting the 2013 constitutional consultations, to be further considered by the

 Bearing in mind the statement made by the Ulu-o-Tokelau at the Pacific

Eradication of Colonialism, held in Nadi, Fiji, from 21 to 23 May 2014, that the 

self-determination process of the Territory could not be addressed in isolation from 

the threat of climate change and the rise in sea level, and bearing in mind also the 

intention of Tokelau to further review the National Strategic Plan in order to 

determine development and other priorities beyond 2015, including consideration of 

the issue of self-determination and how it would address a possible referendum on 

self-determination in cooperation with the administering Power,   

 Recalling the statement made at the seminar by the representative of the 

Government of New Zealand, as the administering Power, citing the close and 

cordial cooperation that has existed for nearly 90 years between the Territory and 

the administering Power, with an emphasis on quality health care and education, 

telecommunications, renewable energy, support for the fisheries sector and the 

establishment of transport infrastructure and services, and noting the gifting by New

 8. Notes the intention of Tokelau to further review its National Strategic

in this regard notes the successful chairmanship by Tokelau in 2014 of the tenth 

annual ministerial meeting of the Forum Fisheries Committee of the Pacific Islands 

Forum Fisheries Agency, held in Tokelau on 1 and 2 July 2014, the r epresentation of

  Draft resolution III  

  Question of American Samoa  
 

 

 The General Assembly,  

 Having considered the question of American Samoa,  

 Having examined the relevant chapter of the report of the Special Committee 

on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the 

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for 2016,  related to 

American Samoa,
1
  

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on American 

Samoa
2
 and other relevant information,  

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory 

are valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the 

people of American Samoa and in conformity with the clearly defined principles 

contained in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 

1541 (XV) of 15 December 1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,  

 Expressing concern that 56 years after the adoption of the Declaration on the 

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples,
3
 there still remain 

17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including American Samoa,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2020 and the plans of action for the Second
4
 and Third International 

Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism,  

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people 

of American Samoa require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the 

options for self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical 

location, size of population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,

the Territory as to the way forward,  

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the 

Non-Self-Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the 

use of the Territories as tax heavens to the detriment of the world economy and by

the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that are 

contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the 

Territory, under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case -by-case basis, and that 

the views of the people of American Samoa in respect of their right to self -

determination should be ascertained,  

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the 

local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional organizations ,  

 Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding 

of the political status of the people of American Samoa and to fulfil its mandate 

effectively, it is important for it to be apprised by the administering Power and to 

receive information from other appropriate sources, including the representatives of 

the Territory, concerning the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory,  

 Aware of the importance both to American Samoa and to the Special 

Committee of the participation of elected and appointed representatives of American 

Samoa in the work of the Committee,  

 Recognizing the need for the Special Committee to ensure that the appropriate 

bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at 

assisting the people of American Samoa with their inalienable right to self -

determination and in gaining a better understanding of the options for self -

determination, on a case-by-case basis,  

 Mindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the 

Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of  

representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 

the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the 

seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial 

element in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political 

status of the Territories,  

 Welcoming the Pacific regional seminar held by the Special Committee in 

Managua and hosted by the Government of Nicaragua from 31 May to 2 June 2016 

as a significant and forward-looking event, which enabled the participants to assess 

the progress made in the decolonization process and to review the existing working 

methods of the Committee and renew its momentum in implementing its historic task,   

 Recognizing the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted 

by the seminar, which are annexed to the report of the Special Committee
5
 and 

which outline the findings of the seminar, including, especially, the way forward for 

the decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General 

Assembly of the period 2011-2020 as the Third International Decade for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,

as regional institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean

Forum and the agencies of the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific,  

 Aware that, under United States law, the Secretary of the Interior takes 

administrative jurisdiction over American Samoa,
7
  

 Recalling the statement made by the representative of the Governor of 

American Samoa at the Caribbean regional seminar held in Managua from 19 to 

21 May 2015 that, while the Territory enjoyed a great deal of self-government, its 

current legal status was seen as an anachronism that exposed the Territory to 

situations beyond its control and needed to be remedied,  

 Recalling also the statement made by the representative of the Governor of 

American Samoa at the 2015 Caribbean regional seminar, expressing concern that 

the Territory continued to get its authority from the President and the Department of 

the Interior of the administering Power, that the Territory had no representation in 

the federal Congress and that its Constitution needed to be approved by the 

Government of the administering Power,  

 Recalling further the position of the administering Power and the statements 

made by representatives of American Samoa at regional seminars inviting the 

Special Committee to send a visiting mission to the Territory,  

 Acknowledging the participation of a representative of American Samoa at the 

2016 Pacific regional seminar,  

 Aware of the work of the Future Political Status Study Commission, completed 

in 2006, the release of its report, with recommendations, in January 2007 and the 

creation of the American Samoa Constitutional Review Committee, as well as the 

holding in June 2010 of the Territory’s fourth Constitutional Convention,  

 Taking note of the decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the 

District of Columbia Circuit, issued on 5 June and 2 October 2015, affirming the 

judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which 

dismissed a lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that would have asserted that 

the citizenship clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the 

United States extended to American Samoa, and taking note also of the pending 

decision by the Supreme Court of the United States on the petition for a writ of 

certiorari submitted on 1 February 2016,  

 Acknowledging the indication by the territorial Government, including at the 

2015 Caribbean regional seminar, that certain federal laws have had and continue to 

have a debilitating impact on the Territory’s ability to achieve sustainable economic 

growth,

the views of the people of Guam in respect of their right to self -determination 

should be ascertained,  

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the 

local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional organizations,   

 Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding 

of the political status of the people of Guam and to fulfil its mandate effectively, it 

is important for it to be apprised by the administering Power and to receive 

information from other appropriate sources, including the representatives of the 

Territory, concerning the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory,  

 Aware of the importance both to Guam and to the Special Committee of the 

participation of elected and appointed representatives of Guam in the work of the 

Committee,  

 Recognizing the need for the Special Committee to ensure that the appropriate 

bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at 

assisting the people of Guam with their inalienable right to self -determination and 

in gaining a better understanding of the options for self-determination, on a case-by-

case basis,  

 Mindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the 

Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 

representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 

the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the 

seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial 

element in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political 

status of the Territories,  

 Welcoming the Pacific regional seminar held by the Special Committee in 

Managua and hosted by the Government of Nicaragua from 31 May to 2 June 2016

Forum and the agencies of the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific,  

 Noting the statement made by the representative of the Governor of Guam at 

the 2016 Pacific regional seminar, in which he presented an update on the efforts of 

Guam towards decolonization, including by securing funding for the public 

education programme on self-determination, and on the work of the Guam 

Commission on Decolonization for the Implementation and Exercise of Chamorro 

Self-Determination in reinforcing public awareness ahead of the planned plebiscite 

on self-determination,  

 Recalling the concern expressed by the representative of the Governor and the 

Speaker of the Guam legislature before the Fourth Committee in October 2015 

about the reinstatement of a lawsuit challenging the voting restrictions for the 

Territory’s plebiscite on self-determination,  

 Cognizant of the efforts made by the Guam Commission on Decolonization to 

promote in the Territory the holding of a plebiscite on self-determination, to 

populate the decolonization registry, as required by public law, to enhance the 

ability to expediently register those who have not yet been registered and to identify 

and secure territorial and federal resources for a self -determination education 

programme,  

 Aware that the Department of the Interior of the United States of America has 

approved a grant to support the self-determination education campaign, as stated by 

the representative of the Governor of Guam at the 2016 Pacific regional seminar,  

 Aware also that, under United States law, the relations between the territorial 

Government and the federal Government in all matters that are not the programme 

responsibility of another federal department or agency are under the general 

administrative supervision of the Secretary of the Interior,
7
  

 Recalling that, in a referendum held in 1987, the registered and eligible voters 

of Guam endorsed a draft Guam Commonwealth Act that would establish a new 

framework for relations between the Territory and the administering Power, 

providing for a greater measure of internal self-government for Guam and 

recognition of the right of the Chamorro people of Guam to self-determination for 

the Territory,  

 Aware that negotiations between the administering Power and the territorial 

Government on the draft Guam Commonwealth Act ended in 1997 and that Guam 

has subsequently established a non-binding plebiscite process for a self-

determination vote by the eligible Chamorro voters,  

 Cognizant of the importance of the administering Power continuing to 

implement its programme of transferring surplus federal land to the Government of 

Guam,  

 Noting that the people of the Territory have called for reform in the 

programme of the administering Power with respect to the thorough, unconditional 

and expeditious transfer of land property to the people of Guam,

military activities and installations on Guam,  

 Recalling also its resolution 57/140 of 11 December 2002, in which it

remaining military bases in compliance with the relevant resolutions of the General 

Assembly,

 9. Further requests the administering Power to cooperate in establishing 

programmes for the sustainable development of the economic activities and 

enterprises of the Territory, noting the special role of the Chamorro people in the 

development of Guam;

regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to
