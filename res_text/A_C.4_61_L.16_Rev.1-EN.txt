 Expressing grave concern about the continuing systematic violation of the 
human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel, the occupying Power, including 
that arising from the excessive use of force, the use of collective punishment, the 
reoccupation and closure of areas, the confiscation of land, the establishment and 
expansion of settlements, the construction of the wall inside the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory in departure from the Armistice Line of 1949, the destruction 
of property and infrastructure, and all other actions by it designed to change the 
legal status, geographical nature and demographic composition of the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 

 Gravely concerned about the military actions that have been carried out since 
28 September 2000 and that have led to thousands of deaths among Palestinian 
civilians, including hundreds of children, and tens of thousands of injuries, 

 Expressing deep concern about the recent deterioration in the humanitarian 
and security situation in the Gaza Strip, including that resulting from the 
continuation and rise in the bombardment against civilian areas, air raids, sonic 
booms and firing of rockets, particularly from the military actions carried out by 
Israel, the occupying Power, that endanger the Palestinian civilian population, and 
especially deploring the killing of Palestinian civilians, including women and 
children, that took place in Beit Hanoun on 8 November 2006, 

 Expressing deep concern also about the vast destruction caused by the Israeli 
occupying forces, including of religious, cultural and historical sites, of vital 
infrastructure and institutions of the Palestinian Authority, and of agricultural land 
throughout Palestinian cities, towns, villages and refugee camps, and expressing 
deep concern about the short- and long-term detrimental impact of such destruction 
on the socio-economic and humanitarian conditions of the Palestinian civilian 
population, 

 Expressing deep concern further about the Israeli policy of closure and the 
severe restrictions, including curfews and the permit regime, that continue to be 
imposed on the movement of persons and goods, including medical and 
humanitarian personnel and goods, throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem, and the consequent negative impact on the 
socio-economic situation of the Palestinian people, which remains that of a dire 
humanitarian crisis, 

 Concerned about the continued establishment of Israeli checkpoints in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the transformation of 
several of these checkpoints into structures akin to permanent border crossings 
inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which are severely impairing the 
territorial contiguity of the Territory and severely undermining efforts to rehabilitate 
and develop the Palestinian economy, 

 Expressing deep concern that thousands of Palestinians, including children and 
women, continue to be held in Israeli prisons or detention centres under harsh 
conditions that impair their well-being, and expressing concern about the ill 
treatment and harassment of any of the Palestinian prisoners and all reports of 
torture, 

 Convinced of the need for an international presence to monitor the situation, to 
contribute to ending the violence and protecting the Palestinian civilian population 
and to help the parties implement the agreements reached and, in this regard,

Israeli civilians resulting in extensive loss of life and injury; 

 5. Notes the Israeli withdrawal from within the Gaza Strip and parts of the

towards the implementation of the road map;8

to the Palestinian Authority, in accordance with the Paris Economic Protocol of

 10. Acknowledges the role the temporary international mechanism plays in 
assisting directly the Palestinian people, and encourages interested donors to make 
use of the mechanism; 

 11. Emphasizes the need to preserve the Palestinian institutions and 
infrastructure for the provision of vital public services to the Palestinian civilian

population and the promotion of Palestinian civil, political, economic, social and 
cultural rights;

movement to and from the outside world;
