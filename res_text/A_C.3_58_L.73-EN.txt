The General Assembly,

among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-

universal peace,

Recalling its resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, containing the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples,

Recalling also its resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970, by which it
approved the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly
Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the
United Nations,

Reaffirming the right to self-determination, by virtue of which all peoples can
freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and
cultural development,

Recognizing that the principles enshrined in Article 2 of the Charter of the
United Nations, in particular respect for national sovereignty, should be respected in
the holding of elections,

A/C.3/58/L.73

Recognizing also the richness and diversity of democratic political systems and
models of free and fair electoral processes in the world, based on national and
regional particularities and various backgrounds,

Recalling that each State has the sovereign right freely to choose and develop,
in accordance with the will of its people, its own political, social, economic and
cultural systems without interference by other States, in strict conformity with the
United Nations Charter,

Stressing the responsibility of States in ensuring ways and means to facilitate
full and effective popular participation in their electoral processes,

Recognizing the contribution made by the United Nations of electoral
assistance provided to numerous States upon their request,

Reaffirming the solemn commitment of all States to fulfil their obligations to
promote universal respect for, and observance and protection of, all human rights
and fundamental freedoms for all in accordance with the Charter, other instruments
relating to human rights, and international law,

Welcoming the commitment of all Member States, expressed in the United
Nations Millennium Declaration,1 to work collectively for more inclusive political
processes allowing genuine participation by all citizens in all countries,

1. Reaffirms that all peoples have the right to self-determination, by virtue
of which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their
economic, social and cultural development, and that every State has the duty to
respect that right, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter of the United
Nations;

2. Reiterates that periodic, fair and free elections are important elements for
the promotion and protection of human rights;

3. Reaffirms the right of peoples to determine methods and to establish
institutions regarding electoral processes and, consequently, that there is no single
model of democracy or of democratic institutions and that States should ensure all
the necessary mechanisms and means to facilitate full and effective popular
participation in those processes;

4. Also reaffirms that democracy is both an ideal to be pursued and a mode
of government to be applied according to modalities that reflect the diversity of
experiences and cultural particularities without derogating from internationally
recognized principles, norms and standards, and that it is thus a constantly perfected
and always perfectible state or condition whose progress will depend upon a variety
of political, social, economic and cultural factors;

5. Further reaffirms that free development of the national electoral process
in each State should be fully honoured in a manner that fully respects the principles
established in the Charter and in the Declaration on Principles of International Law
concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the
Charter of the United Nations;2

6. Calls upon all States to refrain from financing political parties or other
organizations in any other State in a way that is contrary to the principles of the
Charter and that undermines the legitimacy of its electoral processes;

7. Condemns any act of armed aggression or threat or use of force against
peoples, their elected Governments or their legitimate leaders;

8. Reaffirms that the will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of

equivalent free voting procedures.
