concrete policies and actions, and reaffirms the strong political commitment to 

address the challenge of financing and creating an enabling environment at all levels 

for sustainable development in the spirit of global partnership and solidarity,  

 Reaffirming further the Paris Agreement 6  and its early entry into force, 

encouraging all its parties to fully implement the Agreement and parties to the United 

Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 7  that have not yet done so to 

deposit their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, where 

appropriate, as soon as possible,  

 Noting the ongoing efforts to implement the Programme of Action for the Least 

Developed Countries for the Decade 2011–2020, adopted in May 2011 at the Fourth 

United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, 8 the SIDS Accelerated 

Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway, adopted in September 2014 at the third 

International Conference on Small Island Developing States, 9  and the Vienna

hosted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and called fo r 

the provision of access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and 

markets, consistent with sustainable management practices as well as initiatives that 

add value to outputs from small-scale fishers, and noting that, in The State of Food 

Security and Nutrition in the World 2019: Safeguarding against Economic Slowdowns 

and Downturns, the Food and Agriculture Organization highlighted that 80 per cent 

of the countries – 52 out of 65 – with a rise in hunger and an increase in 

undernourishment during recent economic slowdowns and downturns are countries 

whose economies are highly dependent on primary commodities for export and/or

5/10 19-21078 

 

 Recalling the outcome of the fourteenth session of the United Nations 

Conference on Trade and Development,13 and taking note of the decisions and agreed 

conclusions on commodities adopted by the Trade and Development Board and its 

subsidiary bodies, 

 Taking note of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 

Commodities and Development Reports, its State of Commodity Dependence reports 

and its note on commodity dependence and the Sustainable Development Goals, 

noting the role that the Conference has been playing as an institution in looking at the 

interaction between commodity markets and economic development and in the 

elaboration of the concept of commodity-dependent developing countries, 

 Underlining the importance of advancing sustainable consumption and 

production patterns, 

 Noting with concern that the prices of most commodities exhibited a downward  

trend, driven by a variety of factors relating to supply and demand and changing 

inventories, 

 Recognizing that commodity price volatility, including excessive volatility, can 

have adverse impacts on both producer and consumer countries, particularly in 

commodity-dependent countries, and noting with concern that this can undermine 

their development efforts, as it could discourage investment, widen trade deficits and 

aggravate household poverty, 

 Noting that commodity price movements have both macroeconomic and 

microeconomic implications for commodity-dependent developing countries, as well 

as net commodity-importing developing countries, and further noting that rises in 

commodity prices may contribute to improvements by exporting countries in their 

export and fiscal revenue, allowing them to increase current and capital government 

expenditure, and that, by contrast, a decline in commodity prices may lead to 

shortfalls in export and fiscal earnings and the inability of Governments to deliver 

basic goods and services, 

 Expressing concern that the global economy has yet to recover completely and 

remains in a challenging phase, notwithstanding the recent cyclical pickup in global 

economic activity, that growth remains weak in many countries and includes subdued 

trade growth, volatile capital flows, widespread fiscal strains and unsustainable debt 

in some countries, particularly developing countries, and that commodity exporters 

are particularly hard hit owing to their continued adjustment to a sharp step -down in 

foreign earnings, recognizing that, while short-term risks are broadly balanced, 

medium-term risks are still tilted to the downside, and in this regard stressing the need 

for continuing efforts to address systemic fragilities and imbalances, to reform and 

strengthen the international financial system and to make further progress towards 

sustaining and rebalancing global demand, 

 Recognizing the adverse impact of excessive price volatility of commodities, 

especially on women, girls, young people and people in vulnerable situations,  

 Recognizing also that the structural constraints that women face as economic 

agents, including segmentation in low value added or subsistence-oriented work, 

unequal access to productive resources, limited access to training and skill -building 

due to gender segmentation in education and labour markets and a lack of resources, 

as well as the heavy burden of unpaid work, make women and girls especially 

vulnerable to the adverse impact of excessive price volatility of commodities,

 Stressing the importance of policies to address longer-term structural issues, 

including structural constraints faced by women as economic agents, to diversify 

commodity economies and to integrate commodity policies into wider development 

and poverty eradication strategies at all levels,  

 Recognizing that uncertainty in global commodity markets reinforces the need 

to comprehensively deal with the commodity problematique, inter alia, the demand 

for commodities, supply capacities, commodity revenues and investments in 

commodity-dependent economies, while taking due account of the diversity of each 

country’s individual situation and needs and the promotion of their sustainable 

development, and to strengthen the nexus between, inter alia, trade, finance, 

investment in sustainable agriculture and food systems, energy and industrialization,  

 Noting the work on consensus-building on commodity-related issues achieved 

through meetings of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 

including the multi-year expert meetings on commodities and development, the 

Global Commodities Forum and the African Oil, Gas and Mines  Trade and Finance 

Conference and Exhibition, 

 Underlining the importance of timely, accurate and transparent information to 

ensure proper functioning of food commodity markets, in accordance with the 2030 

Agenda, noting global and regional initiatives, including the Agricultural Market 

Information System and its Rapid Response Forum, the joint organization data 

initiative and other regional data platforms and programmes, and urging the 

participating international organizations, private sector actors and Governments to 

ensure the public dissemination of timely and quality food market information 

products, 

 Expressing deep concern at the adverse impact of climate change and extreme 

weather patterns on access to, and the utilization and prices of, agricultural  

commodities, while recognizing the important role of land and sustainable land 

management in the climate system,  

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on world commodity 

trends and prospects;14 

 2. Recognizes the interlinkage between the adequate and transparent 

functioning of commodity markets and the capacity of some commodity-dependent 

developing countries to collect appropriate fiscal revenues from commodity exports 

and mobilize domestic resources to support the achievement of the Sustainable 

Development Goals and their sustainable development, including through sustainable 

and inclusive economic growth, industrialization, decent work and market diversification;  

 3. Encourages support for developing countries, according to their national  

plans and policies, through technical assistance, to increase their capacity in detecting 

and averting trade mispricing in their commodities sectors in order to enhance their 

benefits from those sectors to support the achievement of the Sustainable 

Development Goals; 

 4. Reiterates the need for further efforts to address excessive commodity 

price volatility, in particular by assisting producers, especially small -scale producers, 

including women, in accordance with national plans and policies, in managing r isk; 

 5. Stresses that developing countries, including African countries, the least 

developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing 

States, face particular challenges as lower prices for the commodities that they 

produce threaten the sustainable growth and the debt positions of such countries, and

therefore notes that, in this context, economic and export diversification, value 

addition and industrialization can contribute to strengthening resilience to excessive 

price volatility by allowing the derivation of revenue from various sources;  

 6. Recognizes the need to continue efforts to diversify economies, as well as 

to improve the regulation, where appropriate, and the efficiency, responsiveness, 

functioning and transparency of financial and commodity markets nationally, 

regionally and internationally;  

 7. Acknowledges two main diversification strategies, one being horizontal 

diversification to export different types of commodities and other products to 

different markets, and the other being vertical diversification through value addition, 

and notes that these diversification strategies can contribute to creating sustained jobs 

and foster an inclusive and sustainable process of industrialization in order to achieve 

the Sustainable Development Goals; 

 8. Calls upon the international community to support the efforts of and foster 

cooperation with commodity-dependent developing countries to address the factors 

that create structural barriers to international trade and impede, inter alia, 

diversification, including tariff and non-tariff barriers, limited access to financial 

services resulting in scarce resources for investing in the commodity sector, weak 

infrastructure, particularly regarding both the cost and availability of transportation 

and storage, and lack of skills in producing and marketing alternative products; 

 9. Emphasizes the importance of enhanced collaboration between the public 

and private sectors and high levels of investment in commodity-dependent developing 

countries to promote diversification and upgrade productive structures integrated into 

global value chains for sustainable development;  

 10. Looks forward to the convening of the Twelfth Ministerial Conference of 

the World Trade Organization in Nur-Sultan from 8 to 11 June 2020; 

 11. Notes with concern the slow and uneven recovery from the severe 

economic and financial crisis of 2008, despite the recent strengthening of global 

economic activity, since growth remains weak in many countries and agricultural and 

other commodity prices remain depressed while inequalities are rising, and 

acknowledges that international trade can play a role in achieving the 2030 Agenda 

for Sustainable Development15 and sustainable, robust and balanced growth for all;  

 12. Calls for a coherent set of policy actions at the national, regional and 

international levels to address excessive price volatility and support commodity-

dependent developing countries in mitigating negative impacts, in particular by 

facilitating value addition and enhancing their participation in commodity and related 

product value chains, by supporting large-scale diversification of these economies 

and by encouraging the use and further development of market-oriented risk 

management tools, instruments and strategies;  

 13. Stresses the importance of developing and strengthening agricultural 

policies and strategies that recognize and address women’s critical role in food 

security and improved nutrition outcomes as an integral part of both short - and long-

term responses to food insecurity and malnutrition and food crises in developing 

countries; 

 14. Recognizes the potential for innovation, productivity improvements and 

the promotion of non-traditional exports in most commodity-dependent developing 

countries, particularly in Africa, and calls for enhanced support by the international

community as well as exchanges of experience in these areas within the framework 

of South-South economic cooperation;  

 15. Underscores the importance of increased investments in quality, reliable, 

sustainable and resilient infrastructure as a means of promoting sustainable 

agricultural development and enhancing commodity diversification, including value 

added production, and trade, and urges the international community to assist 

commodity-dependent developing countries to mainstream trade as well as sound 

investment and financial policies as key elements of development strategies, based 

on national circumstances and development priorities, and to invest in and support 

research, innovation and development of sustainable agriculture productivity;  

 16. Stresses that technical assistance and capacity-building aimed at 

improving the commodity export competitiveness of producers are particularly 

important for developing countries, especially in Africa, and invites Member States 

and all relevant stakeholders to provide the necessary resources for commodity-

specific financial and technical assistance, in particular for human and institutional 

capacity-building, including gender-responsive measures, as well as quality, reliable, 

sustainable and resilient infrastructure development of developing countries, with a 

view to reducing their institutional bottlenecks and transaction costs and enhancing 

their commodity trade and development in accordance with national development 

plans; 

 17. Also stresses that the Aid for Trade initiative should aim to help developing 

countries, particularly the least developed countries, to build the supply-side capacity 

and trade-related infrastructure that they need to assist them to implement and benefit 

from World Trade Organization agreements and, more broadly, to expand their trade; 

 18. Recalls the agreement to keep under regular review, by the Ministerial 

Conference and appropriate bodies of the World Trade Organization, the impact of 

the results of the Uruguay Round on the least developed countries as wel l as on the 

net food-importing developing countries, with a view to fostering positive measures 

to enable them to achieve their development objectives, and in this regard calls for 

the implementation of the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures Concer ning 

the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least Developed and Net 

Food-Importing Developing Countries; 

 19. Encourages developed countries that have not already done so and 

developing countries declaring themselves in a position to do so to take steps towards 

the goal of realizing timely implementation of duty-free and quota-free market access 

on a lasting basis for all least developed countries, consistent with the Hong Kong 

Ministerial Declaration adopted by the World Trade Organization in 2005; 

 20. Strongly encourages international financial institutions and development 

banks to assist developing countries, in particular commodity-dependent developing 

countries, in managing the effects of commodity price volatility, including excessiv e 

volatility; 

 21. Reaffirms that every State has and shall freely exercise full permanent 

sovereignty over all its wealth, natural resources and economic activities;  

 22. Recognizes the importance of increasing efficiency, effectiveness and 

transparency in the management of public and private sector revenues in developed 

and developing countries derived from all commodities and commodities -related 

industries, including final processed goods, in support of development;  

 23. Notes the important contributions of the Common Fund for Commodities 

and other international commodities organizations, and encourages them, in 

cooperation with the International Trade Centre, the United Nations Conference on 



 
A/74/379/Add.4 

 

9/10 19-21078 

 

Trade and Development, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization 

and other relevant bodies, to strengthen coordination among them and to identify and 

implement innovative measures to enable the sustainable contribution of the 

commodity sector to economic development, including ways to reduce vulnerability  

to volatility in commodity prices, as well as to enhance activities in developing 

countries to improve access to markets and the reliability of supply, enhance 

diversification and the addition of value, improve the competitiveness of 

commodities, strengthen the market chain, improve market structures, broaden the 

export base and ensure the effective participation of all stakeholders, on the basis of 

a shared understanding of the contribution of commodities to sustainable development;  

 24. Stresses that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 

and its partners, in the spirit of inter-agency cooperation and multi-stakeholder 

partnerships, within their respective mandates, should continue to engage actively in 

collaborative research and analysis of the commodity problematique and related 

capacity- and consensus-building activities, with a view to providing regular analysis 

and policy advice relevant to the sustainable development of commodity-dependent 

developing countries, particularly low-income countries; 

 25. Looks forward to the convening of the fifteenth session of the United 

Nations Conference on Trade and Development in Barbados from 18 to 23 October

to commodity-dependent developing countries, given the tightened access to a ll types 

of credit and noting debt sustainability;  

 28. Welcomes the commitment to redouble efforts to substantially reduce illicit 

financial flows by 2030, with a view to eventually eliminating them;  

 29. Stresses that revenues from commodity production and exports remain 

critical for developing countries, in particular in the context of the implementation of 

the 2030 Agenda, given that developing countries need to mobilize resources in order 

to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and that commodity prices have been 

decreasing since 2011, which has put pressure on government budgets in developing 

countries; 

 30. Invites the President of the General Assembly to hold a one-day informal 

interactive dialogue of the Assembly on commodity markets during the first half of 

2020 to review world commodity trends and prospects and possible strategies for 

economic and export diversification, as well as value addition for sustainable 

development, particularly in commodity-dependent developing countries, with the 

aim of sharing experiences and lessons learned, on a date and in a format to be decided 

by the President of the Assembly;  

 31. Calls upon all relevant bodies, agencies, funds and programmes of the 

United Nations system and other relevant intergovernmental, global, regional and 

subregional organizations, in particular the United Nations Conference on Trade and 

Development and all relevant international financial and economic institutions, 

within their respective mandates, to continue to address the issue of the low 

industrialization and diversification of the economies of some commodity-dependent 

developing countries in relation to the capacity of Member States to achieve all the 

Sustainable Development Goals by 2030;  



A/74/379/Add.4
