matters, 

 Welcoming, in that regard, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the establishment of 

the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms as an important element in the

 Welcoming also the consolidated reports of the Secretary-General on the 

Register, which include the returns of Member States for 2012,
1
 2013

 in 

particular the recommendation that the Secretary-General appeal to Member States 

in a position to do so to provide information on their internationa l transfers of small 

arms and light weapons in their annual report to the Register and the 

recommendation that the seven plus one formula be utilized on a trial basis for the 

period leading up to the deliberations of the next Group of Governmental Experts,

a threat to peace and security, undermines human security and exacerbates the illicit 

trade in wildlife, and as the transparency of licit transfers of small arms and light 

weapons can contribute to tackling these problems and building confidence and trust 

between Member States,

provided by the Treaty, 

 Noting the focused discussions on transparency in armaments that took place 

in the Conference on Disarmament in 2013, 2014 and 2015,  

 Expressing its concern at the decline in reporting to the Register,
