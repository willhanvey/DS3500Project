to the need and situation of the country concerned, and recalling its Presidential

the Government of Mali, the Plateforme coalition of armed groups, and the 

Coordination des Mouvements de l’Azawad coalition of armed groups (“the

make steadfast progress in its implementation,

security sector, have hampered efforts to restore security in the North of Mali, and
