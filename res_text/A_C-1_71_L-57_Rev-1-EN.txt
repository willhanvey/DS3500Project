16-18483 2/3 

 

 Recalling the unequivocal undertaking of the nuclear-weapon States to 

accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear 

disarmament, to which all States parties to the Treaty on the Non -Proliferation of 

Nuclear Weapons
5
 are committed under article VI thereof,  

 Recalling also that significant steps by all the nuclear-weapon States leading 

to nuclear disarmament should promote international stability, peace and security, 

and be based on the principle of increased and undiminished security for all,  

 Recalling further that all States parties to the Treaty commit to apply the 

principles of irreversibility, verifiability and transparency in relation to the 

implementation of their treaty obligations,  

 Convinced that, while verification is not an aim in itself, further development 

of the multilateral nuclear disarmament verification capabilities will be required to 

provide assurance of compliance with multilateral nuclear disarmament agreements 

for the achievement and maintenance of a world without nuclear weapons,  

 Convinced also that, irrespective of different positions on the means to achieve 

the total elimination of nuclear weapons, identifying and developing practical and 

effective measures of nuclear disarmament verification and monitoring will foster 

confidence and facilitate efforts to achieve and maintain a world without nuclear 

weapons, 

 Recalling its resolution 62/21 of 5 December 2007 on verification in all its 

aspects, including the role of the United Nations in the f ield of verification, in 

which it took note of the report of the Panel of Government Experts on verification 

in all its aspects, including the role of the United Nations in the field of 

verification,
6
 as well as the reports of the Secretary-General of 1990 and 1995,

7
 and 

recalling also the report of the Disarmament Commission outlining general 

principles elaborated upon or added to those stated in the Final Document of the 

Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly,
8
  

 Recalling also that the International Atomic Energy Agency, in carrying out its 

functions, shall conduct its activities in accordance with the purposes and principles 

of the United Nations to promote peace and international cooperation, and in 

conformity with policies of the United Nations furthering the establishment of 

safeguarded worldwide disarmament and with any international agreements entered 

into pursuant to such policies, 

 Mindful of the role of verification in existing bilateral and multilateral 

disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control agreements, and the importance of 

making use of existing capabilities of relevant international organizations and 

experiences and lessons learned, as appropriate,  

 Mindful also that, given the challenges associated with verifying nuclear 

disarmament, continuous capacity-building and technical development are critical to 

bridging any shortcomings and establishing effective multilateral nuclear disarmament  

verification,
