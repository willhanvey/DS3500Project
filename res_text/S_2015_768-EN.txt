 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its press statement of 21 April on the maritime tragedy in the 

Mediterranean Sea, 

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, 

territorial integrity and national unity of Libya,  

 Recalling that international law, as reflected in the United Nations Convention 

on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982, sets out the legal frame work applicable 

to activities in the ocean, 

 Reaffirming also the United Nations Convention against Transnational 

Organized Crime (UNTOC Convention) and its Protocol against the Smuggling of 

Migrants by Land, Air and Sea, as the primary international legal  instruments to 

combat the smuggling of migrants and related conduct, and the Protocol to Prevent, 

Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, 

supplementing the UNTOC Convention, as the primary international legal 

instruments to combat trafficking in persons,  

 Underlining that, although the crime of smuggling of migrants may share, in 

some cases, some common features with the crime of trafficking in persons, 

Member States need to recognise that they are distinct crimes, as def ined by the 

UNTOC Convention and its Protocols, requiring differing legal, operational, and 

policy responses, 

 Deploring the continuing maritime tragedies in the Mediterranean Sea that 

have resulted in hundreds of casualties, and noting with concern that such casualties 

were, in some cases, the result of exploitation and misinformation by transnational 

criminal organisations which facilitated the illegal smuggling of migrants via 

dangerous methods for personal gain and with callous disregard for human life,  

 Expressing grave concern at the recent proliferation of, and endangerment of 

lives by, the smuggling of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, in particular off the 



S/2015/768 
 

 

15-17513 2/6 

 

coast of Libya and recognizing that among these migrants may be persons who meet 

the definition of a refugee under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of 

Refugees and the 1967 Protocol thereto,  

 Emphasizing in this respect that migrants, including asylum-seekers and 

regardless of their migration status, should be treated with humanity and d ignity and 

that their rights should be fully respected, and urging all States in this regard to 

comply with their obligations under international law, including international human 

rights law and international refugee law, as applicable, stressing also the obligation 

of States, where applicable, to protect the human rights of migrants regardless of 

their migration status, including when implementing their specific migration and 

border security policies, 

 Reaffirming in this respect the need to promote and protect effectively the 

human rights and fundamental freedoms of all migrants, regardless of their 

migration status, especially those of women and children, and to address 

international migration through international, regional or bilateral cooperation and 

dialogue and through a comprehensive and balanced approach, recognizing the roles 

and responsibilities of countries of origin, transit and destination in promoting and 

protecting the human rights of all migrants, and avoiding approaches that might 

aggravate their vulnerability, 

 Further recalling the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 

and the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue,  

 Expressing further concern that the situation in Libya is exacerbated by the 

smuggling of migrants and human trafficking into, through and from the Libyan 

territory, which could provide support to other organised crime and terrorist 

networks in Libya, 

 Mindful of its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international 

peace and security under the Charter of the United Nations,  

 Underlining the primary responsibility of the Libyan Government to take 

appropriate action to prevent the recent proliferation of, and endangerment of lives 

by, the smuggling of migrants and human trafficking through the territory of Libya 

and its territorial sea, 

 Mindful of the need to support further efforts to strengthen Libyan border 

management, considering the difficulties of the Libyan Government to manage 

effectively the migratory flows in transit through Libyan territory, and noting its 

concern for the repercussions of this phenomenon on the stability of Libya and of 

the Mediterranean region, 

 Welcoming support already provided by the most concerned Member States, 

including Member States of the European Union (EU), taking into account inter alia 

the role of FRONTEX and the specific mandate of EUBAM Libya in support of the 

Libyan Government, and by neighbouring States,  

 Acknowledging the European Council statement of 23 April 2015 and the press 

statement of the African Union Peace and Security Council of 27 Apri l, which 

underlined the need for effective international action to address both the immediate 

and long-term aspects of human trafficking towards Europe,  



 
S/2015/768 

 

3/6 15-17513 

 

 Taking note of the Decision of the Council of the European Union of 18 May 

2015 setting up ‘EUNAVFOR Med’ which underlined the need for effective 

international action to address both the immediate and long -term aspects of migrant 

smuggling and human trafficking towards Europe,  

 Taking further note of the ongoing discussions between the EU and the Libyan 

Government on migration related issues,  

 Expressing also strong support to the States in the region affected by the 

smuggling of migrants and human trafficking, and emphasizing the need to step up 

coordination of efforts in order to strengthen an effective multidimensional response 

to these common challenges in the spirit of international solidarity and shared 

responsibility, to tackle their root causes and to prevent people from being exploited 

by migrant smugglers and human traffickers,  

 Acknowledging the need to assist States in the region, upon request, in the 

development of comprehensive and integrated regional and national strategies, legal 

frameworks, and institutions to counter terrorism, transnational organised crime, 

migrant smuggling, and human trafficking, including mechanisms to implement 

them within the framework of States’ obligations under applicable international law,  

 Stressing that addressing both migrant smuggling and human trafficking, 

including dismantling smuggling and trafficking networks in the region and 

prosecuting migrant smugglers, and human traffickers requires a coordinated, 

multidimensional approach with States of origin, of transit, and of destination, and 

further acknowledging the need to develop effective strategies to deter migrant 

smuggling and human trafficking in States of origin and transit,  

 Emphasizing that migrants should be treated with humanity and dignity and 

that their rights should be fully respected, and urging all States in this regard to 

comply with their obligations under international law, including international human 

rights law and international refugee law, as applicable,  

 Bearing in mind the obligations of States under applicable international law to 

exercise due diligence to prevent and combat migrant smuggling and human 

trafficking, to investigate and punish perpetrators, to identify and provide effective 

assistance to victims of trafficking and migrants and to cooperate to the fullest 

extent possible to prevent and suppress migrant smuggling and human trafficking, 

 Affirming the necessity to put an end to the recent proliferation of, and 

endangerment of lives by, the smuggling of migrants and trafficking of persons in 

the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Libya, and, for these specific purposes, 

acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 1. Condemns all acts of migrant smuggling and human trafficking into, 

through and from the Libyan territory and off the coast of Libya, which undermine 

further the process of stabilisation of Libya and endanger the lives of thousands of 

people; 

 2. Calls on Member States acting nationally or through regional 

organisations, including the EU, to assist Libya, upon request, in building needed 

capacity including to secure its borders and to prevent, investigate and prosecute 

acts of smuggling of migrants and human trafficking through its territory and in its 

territorial sea; in order to prevent the further proliferation of, and endangerment of 



S/2015/768 
 

 

15-17513 4/6 

 

lives by, the smuggling of migrants and human trafficking into, through and from 

the territory of Libya and off its coast;  

 3. Urges Member States and regional organisations, in the spirit of 

international solidarity and shared responsibility, to cooperate with the Libyan 

Government, and with each other, including by sharing information about acts of 

migrant smuggling and human trafficking in Libya’s territorial sea and on the high 

seas off the coast of Libya, and rendering assistance to migrants and victims of 

human trafficking recovered at sea, in accordance with international law; 

 4. Urges States and regional organisations whose naval vessels and aircraft 

operate on the high seas and airspace off the coast of Libya, to be vigilant for acts of 

migrant smuggling and human trafficking, and in this context, encourages States 

and regional organisations to increase and coordinate their efforts to deter acts of 

migrant smuggling and human trafficking, in cooperation with Libya;  

 5. Calls upon Member States acting nationally or through regional 

organisations that are engaged in the fight against migrant smuggling and human 

trafficking to inspect, as permitted under international law, on the high seas off the 

coast of Libya, any unflagged vessels that they have reasonable grounds to believe 

have been, are being, or imminently will be used by organised criminal enterprises 

for migrant smuggling or human trafficking from Libya, including inflatable boats, 

rafts and dinghies; 

 6. Further calls upon such Member States to inspect, with the consent of 

the flag State, on the high seas off the coast of Libya, vessels that they have 

reasonable grounds to believe have been, are being, or imminently will be used by 

organised criminal enterprises for migrant smuggling or human trafficking from 

Libya; 

 7. Decides, with a view to saving the threatened lives of migrants or of

through regional organisations that are engaged in the fight against migrant 

smuggling and human trafficking, to inspect on the high seas off the coast of Libya 

vessels that they have reasonable grounds to suspect are being used for migrant

confirmed as being used for migrant smuggling or human trafficking from Libya, 

and underscores that further action with regard to such vessels inspected under the 

authority of paragraph 7, including disposal, will be taken in accordance with 

applicable international law with due consideration of the interests of any third 

parties who have acted in good faith;
