 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 52/111 of 12 December 1997, in which the Assembly

 Noting, in the above context, the decisions of the Preparatory Committee for

 Noting also all the relevant resolutions and decisions of the Commission on 
Human Rights and of the Human Rights Council on this subject, and calling for 
their implementation, 

 Reiterating that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights 
and have the potential to contribute constructively to the development and well-
being of their societies, and that any doctrine of racial superiority is scientifically 
false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and must be rejected, 
together with theories that attempt to determine the existence of separate human 
races,  

 Convinced that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance manifest themselves in a differentiated manner for women and girls and 
may be among the factors leading to a deterioration in their living conditions, 
poverty, violence, multiple forms of discrimination and the limitation or denial of 
their human rights, and recognizing the need to integrate a gender perspective into 
relevant policies, strategies and programmes of action against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in order to address multiple 
forms of discrimination, 

 Underlining the primacy of political will, international cooperation and 
adequate funding at the national, regional and international levels for the successful 
implementation of the Durban Programme of Action,  

 Alarmed at the increase in racist violence and xenophobic ideas in many parts 
of the world, in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in society at 
large, inter alia, as a result of the resurgent activities of associations established on 
the basis of racist and xenophobic platforms and charters, and the persistent use of 
those platforms and charters to promote or incite racist ideologies,  

 Underlining the importance of urgently eliminating continuing and violent 
trends involving racism and racial discrimination, and conscious that any form of 
impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in 
weakening the rule of law and democracy, tends to encourage the recurrence of such 
crimes and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication,  

 Welcoming the determination of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights to profile and increase the visibility of the struggle against racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and her intention to make 
this a cross-cutting issue in the activities and programmes of her Office,  

 Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General3 and the report of the 
Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance,4 
 

  I

 2.  Expresses its profound concern about and its unequivocal condemnation 
of all forms of racism and racial discrimination, including related acts of racially

xenophobia and related intolerance in any form; 

 3.  Expresses deep concern at recent attempts to establish hierarchies among 
emerging and resurgent forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance, and urges States to adopt measures to address these scourges

protecting victims; 

 4.  Stresses that States and international organizations have a responsibility 
to ensure that measures taken in the struggle against terrorism do not discriminate in 
purpose or effect on grounds of race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, 
and urges all States to rescind or refrain from all forms of racial profiling; 

 5.  Recognizes that States should implement and enforce appropriate and 
effective legislative, judicial, regulatory and administrative measures to prevent and 
protect against acts of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance, thereby contributing to the prevention of human rights violations; 

 6.  Also recognizes that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance occur on the grounds of race, colour, descent or national or 
ethnic origin and that victims can suffer multiple or aggravated forms of 
discrimination based on other related grounds, such as sex, language, religion, 
political or other opinion, social origin, property, birth or other status; 

 7.  Reaffirms that any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that 
constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by 
law; 

 8.  Emphasizes that it is the responsibility of States to adopt effective

prevent those crimes from going unpunished and to ensure the rule of law;

laws, policies and practices so that they are free of racial discrimination and 
compatible with their obligations under international human rights instruments; 

 10.  Condemns the misuse of print, audio-visual and electronic media and 
new communication technologies, including the Internet, to incite violence 
motivated by racial hatred, and calls upon States to take all necessary measures to 
combat this form of racism in accordance with the commitments that they have 
undertaken under the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action,1 in particular 
paragraph 147 of the Programme of Action, in accordance with existing 
international and regional standards of freedom of expression and taking all 
necessary measures to guarantee the right to freedom of opinion and expression; 

 11.  Encourages all States to include in their educational curricula and social 
programmes at all levels, as appropriate, knowledge of and tolerance and respect for 
all cultures, civilizations, religions, peoples and countries; 



A/C.3/62/L.65/Rev.1  
 

07-61618 4 
 

 12.  Stresses the responsibility of States to mainstream a gender perspective 
in the design and development of prevention, education and protection measures 
aimed at the eradication of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance at all levels, to ensure that they effectively target the distinct situations 
of women and men; 
 

  II 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
 

 13.  Reaffirms that universal adherence to and full implementation of the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination5 
are of paramount importance for the fight against racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, including contemporary forms of racism and 
racial discrimination, and for the promotion of equality and non-discrimination in 
the world;  

 14.  Reiterates the call made by the World Conference against Racism, Racial 
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, in paragraph 75 of the Durban 
Programme of Action, to achieve universal ratification of the Convention by 2005 
and for all States to consider making the declaration envisaged under article 14 of 
the Convention, and endorses the grave concern expressed by the Commission on 
Human Rights in its resolution 2005/64 of 20 April 20056 to the effect that, with one 
hundred and seventy-three ratifications and only forty-nine declarations, the 
deadline for universal ratification decided by the World Conference has, regrettably, 
not been realized; 

 15.  Urges, in the above context, the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to maintain and issue regular updates on its 
website of a list of countries that have not yet ratified the Convention and to 
encourage such countries to ratify it at the earliest; 

 16.  Expresses its concern at the serious delays in the submission of overdue 
reports to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which 
impedes the effectiveness of the Committee, makes a strong appeal to all States 
parties to the Convention to comply with their treaty obligations, and reaffirms the 
importance of the provision of technical assistance to the requesting countries in the 
preparation of their reports to the Committee; 

 17.  Invites States parties to the Convention to ratify the amendment to article 
8 of the Convention on the financing of the Committee, and calls for adequate 
additional resources from the regular budget of the United Nations to enable the 
Committee to discharge its mandate fully; 

 18.  Urges all States parties to the Convention to intensify their efforts to 
implement the obligations that they have accepted under article 4 of the Convention,

intolerance;
