  Global efforts for the total elimination of racism, racial

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling all its previous resolutions on the comprehensive follow-up to the

Intolerance and the effective implementation of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference,1 and in this regard 
underlining the imperative need for their full and effective implementation, 

 Stressing that the outcome of the World Conference against Racism, Racial 
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance has the same status as the 
outcomes of all the major United Nations conferences, summits and special sessions 
in the human rights and social fields, 

 Recalling the three Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial 
Discrimination previously declared by the General Assembly, and regretting that the 
Programmes of Action for those Decades were not fully implemented and that their 
objectives are yet to be attained, 

 Reiterating that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights 
and have the potential to contribute constructively to the development and well-
being of their societies, and that any doctrine of racial superiority is scientifically 
false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and must be rejected,

together with theories that attempt to determine the existence of separate human 
races, 

 Underlining the intensity, magnitude and organized nature of slavery and the 
slave trade, including the transatlantic slave trade, and the associated historical 
injustices, as well as the untold suffering caused by colonialism and apartheid, and 
that Africans and people of African descent, Asians and people of Asian descent and 
indigenous peoples continue to be victims of the cascading effects of those legacies, 

 Acknowledging the efforts and initiatives undertaken by States to prohibit 
discrimination and segregation and to engender the full enjoyment of economic, 
social and cultural as well as civil and political rights, 

 Emphasizing that, despite efforts in this regard, millions of human beings 
continue to be victims of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance, including their contemporary manifestations, some of which take 
violent forms, 

 Welcoming the efforts made by non-governmental organizations in support of 
the follow-up mechanisms in the implementation of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action, 

 Recalling the appointment of the five independent eminent experts on 16 June

27 March 2002, with the mandate to follow up on the implementation of the 
provisions of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and to make 
appropriate recommendations thereon, 

 Underlining the primacy of the political will, international cooperation and

related intolerance, for the successful implementation of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action, 

 Recalling its resolution 2142 (XXI) of 26 October 1966 by which the General 
Assembly proclaimed 21 March as the International Day for the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination, 

 Recognizing and affirming that the global fight against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and all their abhorrent and 
contemporary forms and manifestations is a matter of priority for the international 
community, 
 

  I

Committee on the Elaboration of Complementary Standards to the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, in the 
execution of its mandate, to continue to elaborate complementary standards in order 
to fill existing gaps in the International Convention, as well as to elaborate new 
normative standards aimed at combating all forms of contemporary racism, thereby 
also covering areas such as, xenophobia, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism and 
incitement to national or ethnic and religious hatred; 
 

  II 
  International Decade for People of African Descent

 7. Looks forward to the proclamation of the International Decade for People 
of African Descent during its sixty-eighth session;

Descent;
