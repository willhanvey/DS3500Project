A/C.3/56/L.64

Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration4 and the outcome
documents of the twenty-third5 and twenty-fourth6 special sessions of the General
Assembly, held, respectively, in New York from 5 to 10 June 2000 and Geneva from
26 June to 1 July 2000,

Recalling further its resolution 55/102 of 4 December 2000,

Recognizing that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and
interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in
a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis,

Realizing that globalization affects all countries differently and makes them
more exposed to external developments, positive as well as negative, including in
the field of human rights,

Realizing also that globalization is not merely an economic process but also
has social, political, environmental, cultural and legal dimensions which have an
impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights,

Recognizing that multilateral mechanisms have a unique role to play in
meeting the challenges and opportunities presented by globalization,

Expressing concern at the negative impact of international financial turbulence
on social and economic development and on the full enjoyment of all human rights,

Deeply concerned that the widening gap between the developed and the
developing countries, and within countries, has contributed, inter alia, to deepening
poverty and has adversely affected the full enjoyment of all human rights, in
particular in developing countries,

Noting that human beings strive for a world that is respectful of human rights
and cultural diversity and that, in this regard, they work to ensure that all activities,
including those affected by globalization, are consistent with those aims,

1. Recognizes that, while globalization, by its impact on, inter alia, the role
of the State, may affect human rights, the promotion and protection of all human
rights is first and foremost the responsibility of the State;

2. Reaffirms that narrowing the gap between rich and poor, both within and
between countries, is an explicit goal at the national and international levels, as part
of the effort to create an enabling environment for the full enjoyment of all human
rights;

3. Reaffirms also the commitment to create an environment at both the
national and global levels that is conducive to development and to the elimination of
poverty through, inter alia, good governance within each country and at the
international level, transparency in the financial, monetary and trading systems and
commitment to an open, equitable, rule-based, predictable and non-discriminatory
multilateral trading and financial system;

4. Recognizes that, while globalization offers great opportunities, its
benefits are very unevenly shared and its costs are unevenly distributed, an aspect of

the process that affects the full enjoyment of all human rights, in particular in
developing countries;

5. Recognizes also that, only through broad and sustained efforts, including
policies and measures at the global level to create a shared future based upon our
common humanity in all its diversity, can globalization be made fully inclusive and
equitable and have a human face, thus contributing to the full enjoyment of all
human rights;

6. Affirms that globalization is a complex process of structural
transformation, with numerous interdisciplinary aspects, which has an impact on the
enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right
to development;

7. Affirms also that the international community should strive to respond to
the challenges and opportunities posed by globalization in a manner that ensures
respect for the cultural diversity of all;

8. Underlines, therefore, the need to continue to analyse the consequences
of globalization for the full enjoyment of all human rights;

9. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on globalization and its
impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights,7 and requests the Secretary-
General to further seek the views of Member States and to submit a comprehensive
report on this subject to the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session.
