  National legislation on transfer of arms, military equipment 
and dual-use goods and technology  
 
 

 The General Assembly,  

 Recognizing that disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation are essential 
for the maintenance of international peace and security,  

 Recalling that effective national control of the transfer of arms, military 
equipment and dual-use goods and technology, including those transfers that could 
contribute to proliferation activities, is an important tool for achieving those 
objectives,  

 Recalling also that the States parties to the international disarmament and 
non-proliferation treaties have undertaken to facilitate the fullest possible exchange 
of materials, equipment and technological information for peaceful purposes, in 
accordance with the provisions of those treaties,  

 Considering that the exchange of national legislation, regulations and 
procedures on the transfer of arms, military equipment and dual-use goods and 
technology contributes to mutual understanding and confidence among Member 
States,  

 Convinced that such an exchange would be beneficial to Member States that 
are in the process of developing such legislation,  

 Welcoming the electronic database established by the Office for Disarmament 
Affairs of the Secretariat,1 in which all information exchanged pursuant to General 
Assembly resolutions 57/66 of 22 November 2002, 58/42 of 8 December 2003, 
59/66 of 3 December 2004, 60/69 of 8 December 2005, 62/26 of 5 December 2007,

64/40 of 2 December 2009 and 66/41 of 2 December 2011, entitled “National 
legislation on transfer of arms, military equipment and dual-use goods and 
technology”, can be consulted,  

 Welcoming also the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty,2 which establishes the 
highest possible common international standards for regulating the international 
trade in conventional arms and obliges States parties to provide an initial report on 
national laws and other regulations and measures taken in order to implement the 
Treaty,  

 Considering that, as long as the Arms Trade Treaty has not yet entered into 
force, the electronic database established by the Office for Disarmament Affairs will 
retain its added value,  

 Reaffirming the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence in 
accordance with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 1. Invites Member States that are in a position to do so, without prejudice to 
the provisions contained in Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) of 28 April 
2004 and subsequent relevant Council resolutions, to enact or improve national 
legislation, regulations and procedures to exercise effective control over the transfer 
of arms, military equipment and dual-use goods and technology, while ensuring that 
such legislation, regulations and procedures are consistent with the obligations of 
States parties under international treaties, such as the Arms Trade Treaty;  

 2. Encourages Member States to provide, on a voluntary basis, information 
to the Secretary-General on their national legislation, regulations and procedures on 
the transfer of arms, military equipment and dual-use goods and technology, as well 
as the changes therein, and requests the Secretary-General to make that information 
accessible to Member States;  

 3. Decides to remain attentive to the matter.
