 Recalling the statement of its President of 5 August 2009 (S/PRST/2009/24) 
and welcoming ongoing efforts to strengthen UN peacekeeping, 

 Noting that United Nations peacekeeping missions constitute one of several 
means at the United Nations’ disposal to protect civilians in situations of armed 
conflict,

the civilian population and meet its basic needs; 

 2. Reiterates its condemnation in the strongest terms of attacks in situations 
of armed conflict directed against civilians as such and other protected persons or 
objects as well as indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks and the utilisation of 
the presence of civilians to render certain points, areas or military forces immune 
from military operations, as flagrant violations of international humanitarian law 
and demands that all parties immediately put an end to such practices; 

 3. Notes that the deliberate targeting of civilians as such and other protected 
persons, and the commission of systematic, flagrant and widespread violations of 
applicable international humanitarian and human rights law in situations of armed 
conflict may constitute a threat to international peace and security, and reaffirms in 
this regard its readiness to consider such situations and, where necessary, to adopt 
appropriate steps;

at the Security Council’s disposal in accordance with the Charter of the United 
Nations; 

 5. Reiterates its call on States that have not already done so to consider

humanitarian, human rights and refugee law, and to take appropriate legislative, 
judicial and administrative measures to implement their obligations under these 
instruments; 

 6. Demands that all States and parties to armed conflict fully implement all 
relevant decisions of the Security Council and in this regard cooperate fully with 
United Nations peacekeeping missions and Country Teams in the follow-up and 
implementation of these resolutions; 

 7. Calls upon all parties concerned: 



S/2009/582  
 

09-60233 4

international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law, as well as on the 
protection, special needs and human rights of women and children in conflict 
situations, to achieve full and effective compliance; 

 (c) to ensure that orders and instructions issued to armed forces and other 
relevant actors are in compliance with applicable international law, and that they are 
observed, inter alia, by establishing effective disciplinary procedures, central to 
which must be the strict adherence to the principle of command responsibility to 
support compliance with international humanitarian law; 

 (d) to seek, where appropriate, support from United Nations peacekeeping 
and other relevant missions, as well as United Nations Country Teams and the 
International Committee of the Red Cross and, where appropriate, other members of 
the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, on training and awareness 
raising on international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law;

deliberations the compliance of parties to armed conflict with international 
humanitarian, human rights and refugee law; notes the range of existing methods 
used, on a case by case basis, for gathering information on alleged violations of 
applicable international law relating to the protection of civilians and underlines the 
importance in this regard of receiving information that is timely, objective, accurate 
and reliable; 

 9. Considers the possibility, to this end, of using the International Fact-
Finding Commission established by Article 90 of the First Additional Protocol to the 
Geneva Conventions; 

 10. Affirms its strong opposition to impunity for serious violations of 
international humanitarian law and human rights law and emphasizes in this context 
the responsibility of States to comply with their relevant obligations to end impunity 
and to thoroughly investigate and prosecute persons responsible for war crimes, 
genocide, crimes against humanity or other serious violations of international 
humanitarian law in order to prevent violations, avoid their recurrence and seek 
sustainable peace, justice, truth and reconciliation;  

 11. Recalls that accountability for such serious crimes must be ensured by 
taking measures at the national level, and by enhancing international cooperation in 
support of national mechanisms, draws attention to the full range of justice and 
reconciliation mechanisms to be considered, including national, international and 
“mixed” criminal courts and tribunals, and truth and reconciliation commissions, as 
well as national reparation programs for victims and institutional reforms; and 
underlines the Security Council’s role in ending impunity;

09-60233 6 
 

situation on the ground, and a realistic assessment of threats against civilians and 
missions, made in consultation with all relevant stakeholders, and further reaffirms 
the importance of a greater awareness in the Security Council of the resource and 
field support implications of its decisions and stresses the necessity to ensure the

 21. Recognizes the necessity to take into account the protection needs of 
civilians in situations of armed conflict, in particular women and children, in the 
early phase of mandate drafting and throughout the lifecycle of United Nations 
peacekeeping and other relevant missions and in this regard underlines the 
importance of engagement with the countries concerned and of close consultation

arms and light weapons pose a considerable impediment to the provision of 
humanitarian assistance and have a potential to exacerbate and prolong conflicts, 
endanger civilians and undermine security and the confidence required for a return 
to peace and stability, calls on parties to armed conflict to take all feasible 
precautions to protect the civilian population, including children, from the effects of 
landmines and other explosive remnants of war, and in this regard, encourages the

peacekeeping mandates and stresses the need to implement the approaches set out 
therein on a more regular and consistent basis, taking into account the particular 
circumstances of each conflict situation;

the protection of civilians in armed conflict, including on protection-related 
incidents and actions taken by parties to armed conflict to implement their 
obligations to respect and protect the civilian population, including information 
specific to the protection needs of refugees, internally displaced persons, women, 
children and other vulnerable groups; 

 33. Requests the Secretary-General to develop guidance for UN

United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross and other relevant 
organisations including regional organisations to improve the protection of civilians 
in armed conflict;  

 35. Requests the Secretary-General to submit his next report on the 
protection of civilians in armed conflict by November 2010;
