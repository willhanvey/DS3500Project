 Expressing concern that the ninth Review Conference of the Parties to the

 3. Calls for practical steps, as agreed to at the 2000 Review Conference of 

the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to be taken 

by all nuclear-weapon States, that would lead to nuclear disarmament in a way that 

promotes international stability and, based on the principle of undiminished security 

for all: 

 (a) Further efforts to be made by the nuclear-weapon States to reduce their 

nuclear arsenals unilaterally; 

 (b) Increased transparency by the nuclear-weapon States with regard to 

nuclear weapons capabilities and the implementation of agreements pursuant to 

article VI of the Treaty and as a voluntary confidence -building measure to support 

further progress in nuclear disarmament;
