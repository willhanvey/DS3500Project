  Treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 48/75 L of 16 December 1993, 53/77 I of 4 December 
1998, 55/33 Y of 20 November 2000, 56/24 J of 29 November 2001, 57/80 of 
22 November 2002, 58/57 of 8 December 2003, 59/81 of 3 December 2004, 64/29 
of 2 December 2009 and 65/65 of 8 December 2010 on the subject of banning the 
production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive 
devices, 

 Recalling also document CD/1299 of 24 March 1995, in which all members of 
the Conference on Disarmament agreed on the mandate to negotiate a treaty banning 
the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive 
devices and which would not preclude any delegation from raising for 
consideration, in negotiations, any issue noted therein, 

 Recalling further the support for the Conference on Disarmament expressed by 
the Security Council summit on nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, 
held on 24 September 2009, 

 Convinced that a non-discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and 
effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear 
weapons or other nuclear explosive devices would be a significant contribution to 
nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, 

 Recognizing the importance of advancing all issues identified in decision 
CD/1864, adopted by consensus by the Conference on Disarmament on 29 May 
2009,

 Noting the determination of China, France, the Russian Federation, the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America at 
the meeting held in Paris on 30 June and 1 July to renew their efforts, with relevant 
parties, to achieve a treaty banning the production of fissile materials for nuclear 
weapons and other nuclear explosive devices, at the earliest possible date in the 
Conference on Disarmament, 

 Expressing frustration with the years of stalemate in the Conference on 
Disarmament, which has prevented it from fulfilling its mandate as the world’s 
single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum, 

 1. Urges the Conference on Disarmament to agree on and implement early 
in 2012 a comprehensive programme of work that includes the immediate 
commencement of negotiations on a treaty banning the production of fissile material 
for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of document 
CD/1299 of 24 March 1995 and the mandate contained therein; 

 2. Resolves to consider options for the negotiation of a treaty banning the 
production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices 
at its sixty-seventh session should the Conference on Disarmament fail to agree on 
and implement a comprehensive programme of work by the end of its 2012 session; 

 3. Encourages interested Member States, without prejudice to their national 
positions during future negotiations on such a treaty, to continue efforts, including 
within and on the margins of the Conference on Disarmament, in support of the 
commencement of negotiations, including through meetings involving scientific 
experts on various technical aspects of the treaty, drawing on available expertise 
from the International Atomic Energy Agency and other relevant bodies, as 
appropriate; 

 4. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-seventh session 
the item entitled “Treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear 
weapons or other nuclear explosive devices”.
