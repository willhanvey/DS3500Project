The General Assembly,

Having examined the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with
regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence
to Colonial Countries and Peoples,1

Recalling its resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, containing the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples,
and all its subsequent resolutions concerning the implementation of the
Declaration, most recently resolution 50/39 of 6 December 1995, as well as the
relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

Recognizing that the eradication of colonialism is one of the priorities of
the Organization for the decade that began in 1990,

Deeply conscious of the need to take, speedily, measures to eliminate the
last vestiges of colonialism by the year 2000, as called for in its resolution
43/47 of 22 November 1988,

Reiterating its conviction of the need for the elimination of colonialism,
as well as of the need for the total eradication of racial discrimination and
violations of basic human rights,

Noting with satisfaction the achievements of the Special Committee in
contributing to the effective and complete implementation of the Declaration and
other relevant resolutions of the United Nations on decolonization,

Stressing the importance of the participation of the administering Powers
in the work of the Special Committee,

Noting with satisfaction the cooperation and active participation of some
administering Powers in the work of the Special Committee, as well as their
continued readiness to receive United Nations visiting missions in the
Territories under their administration,

Noting with concern the negative impact that the non-participation of
certain administering Powers has had on the work of the Special Committee,
depriving it of an important source of information on the Territories under
their administration,

Aware of the pressing need of newly independent and emerging States for
assistance from the United Nations and its system of organizations in the
economic, social and other fields,

Aware also of the pressing need of the remaining Non-Self-Governing
Territories, including in particular the small island Territories, for economic,
social and other assistance from the United Nations and the organizations within
its system,

Taking special note of the fact that the Special Committee held a Pacific
Regional Seminar to Review the Situation in the Non-Self-Governing Territories,
Particularly Their Political Evolution Towards Self-Determination by the Year
2000, at Port Moresby from 12 to 14 June 1996,2

1. Reaffirms its resolution 1514 (XV) and all other resolutions on
decolonization, including its resolution 43/47, in which it declared the decade
that began in 1990 as the International Decade for the Eradication of
Colonialism, and calls upon the administering Powers, in accordance with those
resolutions, to take all necessary steps to enable the peoples of the
Territories concerned to exercise fully as soon as possible their right to self-
determination, including independence;

2. Affirms once again that the continuation of colonialism in any form or
manifestation - including economic exploitation - is incompatible with the
Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights3 and
the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples;

3. Reaffirms its determination to continue to take all steps necessary to
bring about the complete and speedy eradication of colonialism and the faithful

regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence
to Colonial Countries and Peoples covering its work during 1996, including the

6. Calls upon all States, in particular the administering Powers, as well
as the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations
system, to give effect within their respective spheres of competence to the
recommendations of the Special Committee for the implementation of the
Declaration and other relevant resolutions of the United Nations;

7. Calls upon the administering Powers to ensure that no activity of
foreign economic and other interests in the Non-Self-Governing Territories under
their administration hinders the peoples of those Territories from exercising
their right to self-determination, including independence;

8. Takes note of the decision of some of the administering Powers to
close or reduce some of the military bases in the Non-Self-Governing
Territories;

9. Calls upon the administering Powers to eliminate the remaining
military bases in the Non-Self-Governing Territories in compliance with the
relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, and urges them not to involve
those Territories in any offensive acts or interference against other States;

10. Urges all States, directly and through their action in the specialized
agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, to provide moral
and material assistance to the peoples of colonial Territories, and requests
that the administering Powers, in consultation with the Governments of the
Territories under their administration, take steps to enlist and make effective
use of all possible assistance, on both a bilateral and a multilateral basis, in
the strengthening of the economies of those Territories;

11. Requests the Special Committee to continue to seek suitable means for
the immediate and full implementation of the Declaration and to carry out those
actions approved by the General Assembly regarding the International Decade for
the Eradication of Colonialism in all Territories that have not yet exercised
their right to self-determination, including independence, and in particular:
