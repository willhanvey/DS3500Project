Role of science and technology in the context of international
security and disarmament

The General Assembly,

Recognizing that scientific and technological developments can have both
civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for
civilian applications needs to be maintained and encouraged,

Concerned that military applications of scientific and technological
developments can contribute significantly to the improvement and upgrading of
advanced weapon systems and, in particular, weapons of mass destruction,

Aware of the need to follow closely the scientific and technological
developments that may have a negative impact on international security and
disarmament, and to channel scientific and technological developments for
beneficial purposes,

Cognizant that the international transfers of dual-use as well as high-
technology products, services and know-how for peaceful purposes are important for
the economic and social development of States,

Also cognizant of the need to regulate such transfers of dual-use goods and
technologies and high technology with military applications through multilaterally
negotiated, universally applicable, non-discriminatory guidelines,

Expressing concern over the growing proliferation of ad hoc and exclusive
export control regimes and arrangements for dual-use goods and technologies,
which tend to impede the economic and social development of developing countries,

A/C.1/55/L.31

Recalling that in the Final Document of the Twelfth Summit of Heads of State
or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Durban, South Africa, from 29
August to 3 September 1998,1 it was noted with concern that undue restrictions on
exports to developing countries of material, equipment and technology for peaceful
purposes persist,

Emphasizing that internationally negotiated guidelines for the transfer of high
technology with military applications should take into account the legitimate
defence requirements of all States and the requirements for the maintenance of
international peace and security, while ensuring that access to high-technology
products and services and know-how for peaceful purposes is not denied,

1. Affirms that scientific and technological progress should be used for the
benefit of all mankind to promote the sustainable economic and social development
of all States and to safeguard international security, and that international
cooperation in the use of science and technology through the transfer and exchange
of technological know-how for peaceful purposes should be promoted;

2. Invites Member States to undertake additional efforts to apply science
and technology for disarmament-related purposes and to make disarmament-related
technologies available to interested States;

3. Urges Member States to undertake multilateral negotiations with the
participation of all interested States in order to establish universally acceptable, non-
discriminatory guidelines for international transfers of dual-use goods and
technologies and high technology with military applications;

4. Encourages United Nations bodies to contribute, within existing
mandates, to promoting the application of science and technology for peaceful
purposes;

5. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-sixth session the
item entitled “The role of science and technology in the context of international
security and disarmament”.
