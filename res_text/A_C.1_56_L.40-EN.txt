matters,

Welcoming also the response of Member States to the request contained in
paragraphs 9 and 10 of resolution 46/36 L to provide data on their imports and
exports of arms, as well as available background information regarding their
military holdings, procurement through national production and relevant policies,

Stressing that the continuing operation of the Register and its further
development should be reviewed in order to secure a Register that is capable of
attracting the widest possible participation,

Nations Register of Conventional Arms,1 as provided for in paragraphs 7 to 10 of

paragraph 64 of the 1997 report of the Secretary-General on the continuing
operation of the Register and its further development3 and the recommendations
contained in paragraph 94 of the 2000 report of the Secretary-General and the
appendices and annexes thereto;4

3. Invites Member States in a position to do so, pending further
development of the Register, to provide additional information on procurement from
national production and military holdings and to make use of the “Remarks” column
in the standardized reporting form to provide additional information such as types or
models;

with their views on the continuing operation of the Register and its further
development and on transparency measures related to weapons of mass destruction;

(b) Requests the Secretary-General, with the assistance of a group of
governmental experts to be convened in 2003, on the basis of equitable geographical

development, with a view to a decision at its fifty-eighth session;

and subregional levels, taking fully into account the specific conditions prevailing in
the region or subregion, with a view to enhancing and coordinating international
efforts aimed at increased openness and transparency in armaments;

8. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its
