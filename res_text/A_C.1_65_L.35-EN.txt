and 1988, respectively, 

 Bearing in mind the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the 
General Assembly, adopted by consensus at the first special session devoted to 
disarmament,1 

 Bearing in mind also the ultimate objective of general and complete 
disarmament under effective international control, 

 Taking note of the fact that the Heads of State or Government of the Movement 
of Non-Aligned Countries supported the convening of the fourth special session of 
the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, which would offer an opportunity to

review, from a perspective more in tune with the current international situation, the 
most critical aspects of the disarmament process and to mobilize the international 
community and public opinion in favour of the elimination of nuclear and other 
weapons of mass destruction and of the control and reduction of conventional 
weapons,  

 Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration, adopted by the Heads of 
State and Government during the Millennium Summit of the United Nations, held in 
New York from 6 to 8 September 2000,2 in which the Heads of State and 
Government resolved “to strive for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, 
particularly nuclear weapons, and to keep all options open for achieving this aim, 
including the possibility of convening an international conference to identify ways 
of eliminating nuclear dangers”, 

 Reiterating its conviction that a special session of the General Assembly 
devoted to disarmament can set the future course of action in the fields of 
disarmament, arms control, non-proliferation and related international security 
matters, 

 Emphasizing the importance of multilateralism in the process of disarmament, 
arms control, non-proliferation and related international security matters, 

 Taking note of the paper presented by the Chairman of Working Group II 
during the 1999 substantive session of the Disarmament Commission,3 and the 
written proposals and views submitted by Member States as contained in the 
working papers presented during the three substantive sessions of the Open-ended 
Working Group in 2003,4 as well as the reports of the Secretary-General regarding 
the views of Member States on the objectives, agenda and timing of the fourth 
special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament,5 

 Taking note also of the reports of the Open-ended Working Group to consider 
the objectives and agenda, including the possible establishment of the preparatory 
committee, for the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to 
disarmament,6 

 Expressing deep concern that the fourth special session of the General 
Assembly devoted to disarmament is yet to be convened, despite efforts made in this 
regard, 

 1. Decides to convene an Open-ended Working Group, working on the basis 
of consensus, to consider the objectives and agenda, including the possible 
establishment of the preparatory committee, for the fourth special session of the 
General Assembly devoted to disarmament; 

 2. Also decides that the Open-ended Working Group shall hold its 
organizational session as soon as possible for the purpose of setting a date for its 
substantive sessions in 2011 and 2012, and submit a report on its work, including
