Draft resolution II 

Question of American Samoa  
 

 

 The General Assembly,  

 Having considered the question of American Samoa and examined the report of 

the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the 

Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for 

2021,1 

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on American 

Samoa2 and other relevant information,  

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are 

valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the  people 

of American Samoa and in conformity with the clearly defined principles contained 

in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of 

15 December 1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,  

 Expressing concern that, more than 60 years after the adoption of the 

Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, 3 

there still remain 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including American Samoa,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2030 and the plan of action for the International Decades for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,4 

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of 

American Samoa require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the options 

for self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical location, 

size of population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  

 Acknowledging the outcome of the referendum held on 6 November 2018, in 

which the proposal to give the Fono, the Territory’s legislature, the authority to 

override the Governor’s veto was rejected,  

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-

Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the 

Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world economy 

and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that 

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of American Samoa in respect of their right to self-determination should 

be ascertained,

21-16850 10/85 

 

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the 

local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional 

organizations,  

 Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding 

of the political status of the people of American Samoa and to fulfil its mandate 

effectively, it is important for it to be apprised by the United States of America as the 

administering Power and to receive information from other appropriate sources, 

including the representatives of the Territory, concerning the wishes and aspirations 

of the people of the Territory,  

 Aware of the importance both to American Samoa and to the Special Committee 

of the participation of elected and appointed representatives of American Samoa in 

the work of the Committee,  

 Recognizing the need for the Special Committee to ensure that the appropriate 

bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at 

assisting the people of American Samoa with their inalienable right to self-

determination and in gaining a better understanding of the options for self-

determination, on a case-by-case basis,  

 Mindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the 

Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 

representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 

the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the 

seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial element 

in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of 

the Territories,  

 Recalling the Caribbean regional seminar on the theme “Implementation of the 

Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism: accelerating 

decolonization through renewed commitment and pragmatic measures”, held by the 

Special Committee in Grand Anse, Grenada, and hosted by the Government of 

Grenada from 2 to 4 May 2019, as a significant and forward-looking event, which 

enabled the participants to assess progress made and address challenges faced in the 

decolonization process, review the existing working methods of the Committee and 

renew its commitment to implementing its historic task,  

 Recalling also the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted 

by the seminar, which were annexed to the report of the Special Committee for 2019 5 

and which outlined the findings of the seminar, including, especially, the way forward 

for the decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General 

Assembly of the period 2011–2020 as the Third International Decade for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,6 

 Mindful that the 2021 Caribbean regional seminar, originally scheduled to be 

convened in Dominica, from 19 to 21 May 2021, had to be rescheduled, and 

welcoming the holding of the regional seminar in the Parish of Saint John, Dominica, 

from 25 to 27 August 2021,  

 Noting with appreciation the contribution to the development of some 

Territories by the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations 

system, in particular the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, 

the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the United Nations 

Development Programme and the World Food Programme, as well as regional 

institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean Community, the

Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, the Pacific Islands Forum and the agencies 

of the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific,  

 Recalling the statement made by a representative of the Governor of American 

Samoa at the 2018 Pacific regional seminar,7 

 Recalling also the statement made by that representative in which he expressed 

his view that the people of American Samoa were happy with the relationship with 

the administering Power, which could be described as strong and healthy as well as 

beneficial to the people and the Government of the Territory, and that the most 

important benefit to American Samoa had been the protection of its indigenous rights 

to the land as provided for in the Deeds of Cession,  

 Recalling further the statement made by the representative that the political 

status of American Samoa as an unincorporated and unorganized territory of the 

administering Power limited its ability to self-government and exposed it to decisions 

made by the administering Power,  

 Recalling the statement by the representative that, while certain aspects of the 

form of government of the Territory and its relationship with the administering Power 

were challenging and in need of improvement, the solutions could be found within 

the confines of the political and judicial systems of the administering Power and that 

the territorial Government was pursuing legal actions to counteract the impact of 

unfavourable federal actions and sought the international community’s tacit support,  

 Recalling also the information provided by the representative that the 

Government of American Samoa intended to pursue additional funding from the 

administering Power to maintain and expand the work of the Office of Political Status, 

Constitutional Review and Federal Relations,  

 Aware of the work of the Future Political Status Study Commission, completed 

in 2006, the release of its report, with recommendations, in January 2007 and the 

creation of the American Samoa Constitutional Review Committee, as well as the 

holding in June 2010 of the Territory’s fourth Constitutional Convention,  

 Recalling the decisions of the United States judiciary in which it dismissed a 

lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that would have asserted that the citizenship 

clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States extended 

to American Samoa, and taking note of the decision in which the petition for a writ 

of certiorari was denied,8 

 Noting another case before the United States judiciary regarding the citizenship 

clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States,9 

 Stressing the importance of regional ties for the development of a small island 

Territory,  

 Noting the elections held in the Territory in November 2020 to elect the 

Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, 20 members of the American Samoa House of 

Representatives and the delegate to the United States House of Representatives, 10 

 Recalling its resolutions 74/270 of 2 April 2020, entitled “Global solidarity to 

fight the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)”, 74/274 of 20 April 2020, entitled

 1. Reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of American Samoa to self-

determination, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and with General

Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples;  

 2. Also reaffirms that, in the process of the decolonization of American 

Samoa, there is no alternative to the principle of self-determination, which is also a 

fundamental human right, as recognized under the relevant human rights conventions;  

 3. Further reaffirms that it is ultimately for the people of American Samoa to 

determine freely their future political status in accordance with the relevant 

provisions of the Charter, the Declaration and the relevant resolutions of the General 

Assembly, and in that connection calls upon the administering Power, in cooperation 

with the territorial Government and appropriate bodies of the United Nations system, 

to develop political education programmes for the Territory in order to foster an 

awareness among the people of their right to self-determination in conformity with 

the legitimate political status options, based on the principles clearly defined in 

Assembly resolution 1541 (XV) and other relevant resolutions and decisions;  

 4. Takes note of the work of the territorial Government with respect to 

moving forward on political status, local autonomy and self-governance issues with 

a view to making political and economic progress, and recalls the establishment in 

April 2016 of the Office of Political Status, Constitutional Review and Federal 

Relations;  

 5. Recalls the indication by the territorial Government that American Samoa 

should remain on the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories, under the purview of the 

Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the 

Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, until 

such time as its people have exercised their right to self-determination;  

 6. Also recalls the invitation extended in 2015 by the Governor of American

Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the 

Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for 

2021,1 

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on Anguilla 2 and 

other relevant information, 

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are 

valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people 

of Anguilla and in conformity with the clearly defined principles contained in General 

Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of 15 December 

1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,  

 Expressing concern that, more than 60 years after the adoption of the 

Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, 3 

there still remain 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including Anguilla,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2030 and the plan of action for the International Decades for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,4 

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of 

Anguilla require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the options for self-

determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical location, size of 

population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people, 

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-

Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the 

Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world economy 

and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that 

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV), 

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of Anguilla in respect of their right to self-determination should be 

ascertained, 

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the 

local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional 

organizations,

 Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding

Ireland as the administering Power and to receive information from other appropriate 

sources, including the representatives of the Territory, concerning the wishes and 

aspirations of the people of the Territory,

case basis,

Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 

representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 

the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the

in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of 

the Territories, 

 Recalling the Caribbean regional seminar on the theme “Implementation of the 

Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism: accelerating

Grenada from 2 to 4 May 2019, as a significant and forward-looking event, which 

enabled the participants to assess progress made and address challenges faced in the 

decolonization process, review the existing working methods of the Committee and 

renew its commitment to implementing its historic task,  

 Recalling also the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted 

by the seminar, which were annexed to the report of the Special Committee for 20195 

and which outlined the findings of the seminar, including, especially, the way forward 

for the decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General 

Assembly of the period 2011–2020 as the Third International Decade for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,6 

 Mindful that the 2021 Caribbean regional seminar, originally scheduled to be 

convened in Dominica, from 19 to 21 May 2021, had to be rescheduled, and 

welcoming the holding of the regional seminar in the Parish of Saint John, Dominica, 

from 25 to 27 August 2021,  

 Noting with appreciation the contribution to the development of some 

Territories by the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations 

system, in particular the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, 

the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the United Nations 

Development Programme and the World Food Programme, as well as regional 

institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean Community, the

  Question of the British Virgin Islands 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Having considered the question of the British Virgin Islands and examined the 

report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation 

of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples 

for 2021,1  

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on the British 

Virgin Islands2 and other relevant information,  

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are 

valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people 

of the British Virgin Islands and in conformity with the clearly defined principles 

contained in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 

1541 (XV) of 15 December 1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,  

 Expressing concern that, more than 60 years after the adoption of the 

Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, 3 

there still remain 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including the British Virgin 

Islands,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2030 and the plan of action for the International Decades for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,4  

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of 

the British Virgin Islands require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the 

options for self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical 

location, size of population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-

Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the 

Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world economy 

and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that 

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of the British Virgin Islands in respect of their right to self-determination 

should be ascertained,

  Question of Guam 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Having considered the question of Guam and examined the report of the Special 

Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on 

the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for 2021,1 

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on Guam,2 which 

contained the information requested by the General Assembly in resolution 75/113 of 

10 December 2020, and other relevant information, 

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are 

valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people 

of Guam and in conformity with the clearly defined principles contained in General 

Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of 15 December 

1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,  

 Expressing concern that, more than 60 years after the adoption of the Declaration 

on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, 3  there still 

remain 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including Guam, 

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2030 and the plan of action for the International Decades for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,4 

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of 

Guam require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the options for self -

determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical location, size of 

population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that referendums, 

free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an important role 

in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-

Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the 

Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world economy and

contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 1514 (XV),

Power from the Special Rapporteurs on the issue of human rights obligations relating 

to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, on the rights of  

indigenous peoples and on the implications for human rights of the environmentally 

sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes,  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views of 

the people of Guam in respect of their right to self-determination should be ascertained,

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the 

local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional organizations,  

 Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding 

of the political status of the people of Guam and to fulfil its mandate effectively, it is 

important for it to be apprised by the United States of America as the administering 

Power and to receive information from other appropriate sources, including the 

representatives of the Territory, concerning the wishes and aspirations of the people 

of the Territory, 

 Aware of the importance both to Guam and to the Special Committee of the

assisting the people of Guam with their inalienable right to self-determination and in

case basis, 

 Mindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the 

Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 

representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 

the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the 

seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial element 

in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of 

the Territories, 

 Recalling the Caribbean regional seminar on the theme “Implementation of the 

Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism: accelerating 

decolonization through renewed commitment and pragmatic measures”, held by the 

Special Committee in Grand Anse, Grenada, and hosted by the Government of 

Grenada from 2 to 4 May 2019, as a significant and forward-looking event, which 

enabled the participants to assess progress made and address challenges faced in the 

decolonization process, review the existing working methods of the Committee and 

renew its commitment to implementing its historic task,  

 Recalling also the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted 

by the seminar, which were annexed to the report of the Special Committee for 2019 5

for the decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General 

Assembly of the period 2011–2020 as the Third International Decade for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,6 

 Noting with appreciation the contribution to the development of some Territories 

by the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, in 

particular the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the 

Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the United Nations 

Development Programme and the World Food Programme, as well as regional 

institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean Community, the 

Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, the Pacific Islands Forum and the agencies 

of the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific,

 Noting with concern that a plebiscite on self-determination has been brought to 

a halt, which followed the ruling 7  of a federal court in the United States, the 

administering Power, holding that the plebiscite could not be limited to native 

inhabitants, 

 Recalling, in this regard, the statement made by a representative of the Governor 

of Guam at the 2019 Caribbean regional seminar concerning the implications of the 

judicial case in the light of the nature and essence of the Charter of the United Nations 

and resolution 1514 (XV),8 

 Cognizant of the efforts made by the Guam Commission on Decolonization for 

the Implementation and Exercise of CHamoru Self-Determination to promote in the 

Territory the holding of a plebiscite on self-determination and to advance its 

education campaign on each of the three political status options, and recalling that 

more than 11,000 native inhabitants had been registered in the Guam decolonization 

registry to vote in the plebiscite, 

 Recalling that the administering Power approved a grant to support the self-

determination education campaign in the Territory in March 2016,  

 Recalling also that, in a referendum held in 1987, the registered and eligible 

voters of Guam endorsed a draft Guam Commonwealth Act that would establish a 

new framework for relations between the Territory and the administering Power, 

providing for a greater measure of internal self-government for Guam and recognition 

of the right of the CHamoru people of Guam to self-determination for the Territory, 

 Aware that negotiations between the administering Power and the territorial 

Government on the draft Guam Commonwealth Act ended in 1997 and that Guam has 

subsequently established a non-binding plebiscite process for a self-determination 

vote by the eligible CHamoru voters,  

 Cognizant of the importance of the administering Power’s implementing its 

programme of transferring surplus federal land to the Government of Guam,

respect to the thorough, unconditional and expeditious transfer of land property to the 

people of Guam, 

 Aware that the federal lawsuit by the administering Power over the CHamoru 

Land Trust programme was filed in September 2017, and noting the ruling 9 issued on

 Noting the expressed desire of the territorial Government for a visiting mission 

by the Special Committee, as renewed during the 2021 session of the Special 

Committee, 

 Aware of the existing concerns of the Territory regarding the potential social, 

cultural, economic and environmental impacts of the planned transfer of additional 

military personnel of the administering Power to the Territory,  

 Recalling the concerns expressed by the Territory on this subject before the 

Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) at the seventy-

 Recalling also the statement made by the Speaker of the thirty-third Guam 

legislature before the Fourth Committee at the seventieth session of the General 

Assembly that the most acute threat to the legitimate exercise of the decolonization 

of Guam was the incessant militarization of the island by its administering Power, 

and noting the concern expressed regarding the effect of the escalating military 

activities and installations of the administering Power on Guam,  

 Recalling further its resolution 57/140 of 11 December 2002, in which it 

reiterated that military activities and arrangements by administering Powers in the 

Non-Self-Governing Territories under their administration should not run counter to 

the rights and interests of the peoples of the Territories concerned, especially their 

right to self-determination, including independence, and called upon the 

administering Powers concerned to terminate such activities and to eliminate the 

remaining military bases in compliance with the relevant resolutions of the General 

Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 35/118 of 11 December 1980 and the territorial 

Government’s concern that immigration into Guam has resulted in the indigenous 

CHamorus becoming a minority in their homeland, 

 Stressing the importance of regional ties for the development of a small island 

Territory, 

 Noting the legislative elections in the Territory that were held in November 2020,10

options, based on the principles clearly defined in Assembly resolution 1541 (XV)

  Draft resolution IX 

  Question of Montserrat 
 

 

 The General Assembly,  

 Having considered the question of Montserrat and examined the report of the 

Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the 

Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for 

2021,1 

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on Montserrat 2 and 

other relevant information,  

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are 

valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people 

of Montserrat and in conformity with the clearly defined principles contained in 

General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of 

15 December 1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,  

 Expressing concern that, more than 60 years after the adoption of the 

Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, 3 

there still remain 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including Montserrat,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2030 and the plan of action for the International Decades for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,4 

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of 

Montserrat require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the options for 

self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical location, 

size of population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-

Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the 

Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world economy 

and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that 

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of Montserrat in respect of their right to self-determination should be 

ascertained,  

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the 

local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional 

organizations,

 Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding 

of the political status of the people of Montserrat and to fulfil its mandate effectively, 

it is important for it to be apprised by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and

appropriate sources, including the representatives of the Territory, concerning the 

wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory,

Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 

representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 

the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the

in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of 

the Territories,  

 Recalling the Caribbean regional seminar on the theme “Implementation of the

enabled the participants to assess progress made and address challenges faced in the 

decolonization process, review the existing working methods of the Committee and 

renew its commitment to implementing its historic task,  

 Recalling also the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted 

by the seminar, which were annexed to the report of the Special Committee for 2019 5

for the decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General 

Assembly of the period 2011–2020 as the Third International Decade for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,6

 Recalling the statements made by the Premier of Montserrat before the Special

expressed the view that the previous request made for the removal of Montserrat from 

the agenda of the Special Committee should be reversed,  

 Recalling also the information provided by the Premier that Montserrat could 

not achieve its development goals if its economic dependency continued, 

compounded by ongoing financial challenges, and that securing funding for

institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean Community, the 

Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, the Pacific Islands Forum and the agencies 

of the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific,  

 Noting with concern the continuing consequences of the 1995 volcanic eruption, 

which led to the evacuation of three quarters of the population of the Territory to safe 

areas of the island and to areas outside the Territory and which continues to have 

enduring consequences for the economy of the island,  

 Acknowledging the continuing assistance provided to the Territory by States 

members of the Caribbean Community, in particular Antigua and Barbuda, which has 

offered safe refuge and access to educational and health facilities, as well as 

employment for thousands who have left the Territory,  

 Noting the continuing efforts of the administering Power and the territorial 

Government to deal with the consequences of the volcanic eruption,  

 Recalling the importance of improving the infrastructure and accessibility of

there still remain 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including Pitcairn,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2030 and the plan of action for the International Decades for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,4  

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of 

Pitcairn require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the options for self -

determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical location, size of 

population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-

Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the 

Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world economy 

and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that 

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of Pitcairn in respect of their right to self-determination should be 

ascertained,  

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the 

local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional 

organizations,

 Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding 

of the political status of the people of Pitcairn and to fulfil its mandate effectively, it 

is important for it to be apprised by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 

Ireland as the administering Power and to receive information from other appropriate 

sources, including the representatives of the Territory, concerning the wishes and 

aspirations of the people of the Territory,  

 Aware of the importance both to Pitcairn and to the Special Committee of the 

participation of elected and appointed representatives of Pitcairn in the work of the 

Committee,  

 Recognizing the need for the Special Committee to ensure that the appropriate 

bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at 

assisting the people of Pitcairn with their inalienable right to self-determination and 

in gaining a better understanding of the options for self-determination, on a case-by-

case basis,

Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 

representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 

the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the 

seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial element 

in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of 

the Territories,  

 Recalling the Caribbean regional seminar on the theme “Implementation of the 

Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism: accelerating 

decolonization through renewed commitment and pragmatic measures”, held by the 

Special Committee in Grand Anse, Grenada, and hosted by the Government of 

Grenada from 2 to 4 May 2019, as a significant and forward-looking event, which 

enabled the participants to assess progress made and address challenges faced in the 

decolonization process, review the existing working methods of the Committee  and 

renew its commitment to implementing its historic task,  

 Recalling also the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted 

by the seminar, which were annexed to the report of the Special Committee for 2019 5 

and which outlined the findings of the seminar, including, especially, the way forward 

for the decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General 

Assembly of the period 2011–2020 as the Third International Decade for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,6  

 Mindful that the 2021 Caribbean regional seminar, originally scheduled to be 

convened in Dominica, from 19 to 21 May 2021, had to be rescheduled, and 

welcoming the holding of the regional seminar in the Parish of Saint John, Dominica, 

from 25 to 27 August 2021,  

 Noting with serious concern that the Territory last participated in the activities 

of the Special Committee in 2004,  

 Taking into account the unique character of Pitcairn in terms of population, area 

and access,  

 Aware that the administering Power and the territorial Government have 

implemented a governance structure to strengthen administrative capacity in the 

Territory, based on consultations with the people of the Territory,

  Draft resolution XIII  

  Question of Tokelau 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Having considered the question of Tokelau, 

 Taking note of the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard 

to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial 

Countries and Peoples for 2021,1  

 Recalling its resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, containing the 

Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, and 

all resolutions and decisions of the United Nations relating to Non-Self-Governing 

Territories, in particular General Assembly resolution 75/118 of 10 December 2020,  

 Noting with appreciation the continuing exemplary cooperation of New Zealand 

as the administering Power with regard to the work of the Special Committee relating 

to Tokelau and its readiness to permit access by United Nations visiting missions to 

the Territory,  

 Noting with appreciation also the collaborative contribution to the development 

of Tokelau by New Zealand and the specialized agencies and other organizations of 

the United Nations system, in particular the United Nations Development Programme 

and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,  

 Bearing in mind that, as a small island Territory, Tokelau exemplifies the 

situation of most remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories and that, as a case study 

pointing to successful cooperation for decolonization, Tokelau has wider significance 

for the United Nations as it seeks to complete its work in decolonization, 

 Recalling the status of Tokelau as an associate member of the Food and 

Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and of the Pacific Islands Forum,  

 Acknowledging the World No Tobacco Day Award for the western Pacific region 

granted to Tokelau in 2017 by the World Health Organization for its policy entitled 

“Tobacco-Free Tokelau by 2020”, and expressing hope that this could contribute to 

the health and well-being of the Territory and its peoples, 

 Cognizant that New Zealand and Tokelau signed, on 21 November 2003, a 

document entitled “Joint statement of the principles of partnership”, which sets out 

the rights and responsibilities of the two partners,  

 Bearing in mind the decision of the General Fono at its meeting in November 

2003, following extensive consultations undertaken in all three villages, to explore 

formally with New Zealand the option of self-government in free association, its 

decision in August 2005 to hold in February 2006 a referendum on self-determination 

on the basis of a draft constitution for Tokelau and a draft treaty of free association 

with New Zealand, and its subsequent decision to hold a further referendum in 

October 2007, and bearing in mind also that the two referendums did not produce the 

two-thirds majority of valid votes cast required by the General Fono to change the 

status of Tokelau from that of a Non-Self-Governing Territory under the 

administration of New Zealand, 

 Noting the holding of free and fair elections in the Territory on 23 January 2020, 

and noting also the most recent change of the Ulu-o-Tokelau during the General Fono, 

on 8 March 2021,

statement for the Pacific regional seminar held in Saint George’s from 9 to 11 May 

2018 that the self-determination process of the Territory could not be addressed in

aspirations of Tokelau as expressed in the National Strategic Plan 2016–2020, 

including a self-determination referendum,

  Draft resolution XIV 

  Question of the Turks and Caicos Islands 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Having considered the question of the Turks and Caicos Islands and examined 

the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the 

Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial 

Countries and Peoples for 2021,1 

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on the Turks and 

Caicos Islands2 and other relevant information,  

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are 

valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people 

of the Turks and Caicos Islands and in conformity with the clearly defined principles 

contained in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 

(XV) of 15 December 1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,  

 Expressing concern that, more than 60 years after the adoption of the 

Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, 3 

there still remain 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including the Turks and Caicos 

Islands,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2030 and the plan of action for the International Decades for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,4 

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of 

the Turks and Caicos Islands require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to 

the options for self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, 

geographical location, size of population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-

Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the 

Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world economy 

and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that 

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of the Turks and Caicos Islands in respect of their right to self -

determination should be ascertained,  

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the 

local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional organizations,

 Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding 

of the political status of the people of the Turks and Caicos Islands and to fulfil its 

mandate effectively, it is important for it to be apprised by the United Kingdom of 

Great Britain and Northern Ireland as the administering Power and to receive 

information from other appropriate sources, including the representatives of the 

Territory, concerning the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory,  

 Aware of the importance both to the Turks and Caicos Islands and to the Special 

Committee of the participation of elected and appointed representatives of the Turks 

and Caicos Islands in the work of the Committee,  

 Recognizing the need for the Special Committee to ensure that the appropriate 

bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at 

assisting the people of the Turks and Caicos Islands with their inalienable right to 

self-determination and in gaining a better understanding of the options for self-

determination, on a case-by-case basis,  

 Mindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the 

Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 

representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 

the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the 

seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial element 

in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of 

the Territories,  

 Recalling the Caribbean regional seminar on the theme “Implementation of the 

Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism: accelerating 

decolonization through renewed commitment and pragmatic measures”, held by the 

Special Committee in Grand Anse, Grenada, and hosted by the Government of 

Grenada from 2 to 4 May 2019, as a significant and forward-looking event, which 

enabled the participants to assess progress made and address challenges faced in the 

decolonization process, review the existing working methods of the Committee and 

renew its commitment to implementing its historic task,  

 Recalling also the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted 

by the seminar, which were annexed to the report of the Special Committee for 2019 5 

and which outlined the findings of the seminar, including, especially, the way forward 

for the decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General 

Assembly of the period 2011–2020 as the Third International Decade for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,6 

 Mindful that the 2021 Caribbean regional seminar, originally scheduled to be 

convened in Dominica, from 19 to 21 May 2021, had to be rescheduled, and 

welcoming the holding of the regional seminar in the Parish of Saint John, Dominica, 

from 25 to 27 August 2021,  

 Noting with appreciation the contribution to the development of some 

Territories by the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations 

system, in particular the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, 

the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the United Nations 

Development Programme and the World Food Programme, as well as regional 

institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean Community, the 

Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, the Pacific Islands Forum and the agencies 

of the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific,

 Recalling the statement made by a representative appointed by the Government 

of the Turks and Caicos Islands at the Caribbean regional seminar held in Managua 

from 19 to 21 May 2015,7 

 Noting with serious concern that the Territory last participated in the activities 

of the Special Committee in 2015,  

 Recalling the dispatch of the United Nations special mission to the Turks and 

Caicos Islands in 2006 at the request of the territorial Government and with the 

concurrence of the administering Power,  

 Recalling also the endorsement by the Heads of Government of the Caribbean 

Community of the report of the Community’s fact-finding mission to the Turks and 

Caicos Islands in 2013, which called for, inter alia, a referendum on self -

determination and a mechanism for amending the Constitution,  

 Recalling further that, in March 2014, the Heads of Government of the 

Caribbean Community received an update on the situation in the Turks and Caicos 

Islands, which they will continue to monitor, and that they expressed their support for 

the full restoration of democracy in the Territory on terms driven by its people,  

 Recalling with concern the devastating damage and impact caused in the 

Territory by Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria in 2017,  

 Stressing the importance of regional ties for the development of a small island 

Territory,  

 Noting the general election that was held in February 2021,8 

 Recalling its resolutions 74/270 of 2 April 2020, entitled “Global solidarity to

Islands to self-determination, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations 

and with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), containing the Declaration on the 

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples;  

 2. Also reaffirms that, in the process of decolonization of the Turks and

 3. Further reaffirms that it is ultimately for the people of the Turks and 

Caicos Islands to determine freely their future political status in accordance with the 

relevant provisions of the Charter, the Declaration and the relevant resolutions of the

  Draft resolution XV 

  Question of the United States Virgin Islands  
 

 

  The General Assembly, 

 Having considered the question of the United States Virgin Islands and 

examined the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the 

Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial 

Countries and Peoples for 2021,1  

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on the United 

States Virgin Islands2 and other relevant information,  

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are 

valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people 

of the United States Virgin Islands and in conformity with the clearly defined 

principles contained in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 

1960, 1541 (XV) of 15 December 1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,  

 Expressing concern that, more than 60 years after the adoption of the 

Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples,3 

there still remain 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including the United States 

Virgin Islands,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2030 and the plan of action for the International Decades for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,4 

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of 

the United States Virgin Islands require flexible, practical and innovative approaches 

to the options for self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, 

geographical location, size of population or natural resources,

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the 

Non-Self-Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the 

use of the Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world 

economy and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering 

Powers that are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to 

resolution 1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of the United States Virgin Islands in respect of their right to 

self-determination should be ascertained,

 Bearing in mind its resolution 75/123 of 10 December 2020, by which it
