 Recalling also the relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights in

 Recalling further the United Nations Millennium Declaration adopted by the 
General Assembly on 8 September 2000,1 welcoming the resolve expressed in the 
Millennium Declaration to take measures to eliminate the increasing acts of racism

organizations and civil societies to contribute to the implementation of the 
Programme of Action contained in the Global Agenda, 

 Welcoming the launch of the Alliance of Civilizations initiative, intended to 
respond to the need for a committed effort by the international community, in order 
to promote mutual respect and understanding among different cultures and societies, 

 Welcoming the progress achieved in the follow-up to the Durban Declaration 
and Programme of Action, 

 Underlining the importance of increasing contacts at all levels in order to 
deepen dialogue and reinforce understanding among different cultures, religions and 
civilizations, and noting with regret in this regard the cancellation of the meeting on 
“Civilization and harmony: values and mechanisms of the global order”, which was 
to be held in Turkey, in 2004 as a follow-up to the Organization of the Islamic 
Conference-European Union Joint Forum on the theme “Civilization and harmony: 
the political dimension”, held in Turkey in 2002,  

 Reaffirming that discrimination against human beings on the grounds of 
religion or belief constitutes an affront to human dignity and a disavowal of the 
principles of the Charter, 

 Convinced that respect for cultural, ethnic, religious and linguistic diversities, 
as well as dialogue among and within civilizations, is essential for peace, 
understanding and friendship among individuals and people of the different cultures 
and nations of the world, while manifestations of cultural prejudice, intolerance and 
xenophobia towards different cultures and religions generate hatred and violence 
among peoples and nations throughout the world, 

 Recognizing the valuable contributions of all religions to modern civilization 
and the contribution that dialogue among civilizations can make to an improved 
awareness and understanding of the common values shared by all humankind, 

 Reaffirming the need for all States to continue international efforts to enhance 
dialogue and broaden understanding among civilizations, cultures and religions, and 
emphasizing that States, regional organizations, non-governmental organizations, 
religious bodies and the media have an important role to play in promoting 
tolerance, respect for and freedom of religion and belief, 

 Underlining the important role of education in the promotion of cultural and 
religious tolerance and the elimination of discrimination based on religion or belief, 

 Alarmed at the continuing negative impact of the events of 11 September 2001 
on Muslim minorities and communities in some non-Muslim countries, the negative 
projection of Islam in the media and the introduction and enforcement of laws that 
specifically discriminate against and target Muslims, 

 Alarmed also at the serious instances of intolerance, discrimination and acts of 
violence based on religion or belief, intimidation and coercion motivated by 
extremism, religious or otherwise, occurring in many parts of the world and 
threatening the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, 

 Noting with concern that defamation of religions is among the causes of social 
disharmony and leads to violations of human rights, 



 A/C.3/61/L.28

 

3 06-60000 
 

 Deeply alarmed at the rising trends to condone discrimination based on 
religion and faith through intellectual and ideological validation, 

 Deeply alarmed also at the rise of some national policies and laws that 
stigmatize groups of people belonging to certain religions and faiths under a variety 
of pretexts relating to security and illegal immigration, 

 Noting with deep concern the increasing trend in recent years of statements 
attacking religions, Islam and Muslims in particular, especially in human rights

manifestations of intolerance and discrimination in matters of religion or belief still 
in evidence in some regions of the world; 

 2. Strongly deplores physical attacks and assaults on businesses, cultural 
centres and places of worship of all religions as well as targeting of religious 
symbols;

associated with human rights violations and terrorism;

related intolerance and discrimination against Islam or any other religion;

reaction to counter-terrorism measures, defamation of religions becomes an 
aggravating factor that contributes to the denial of fundamental rights and freedoms 
of target groups, as well as their economic and social exclusion; 

 8. Stresses the need to effectively combat defamation of all religions, Islam 
and Muslims in particular, especially in human rights forums; 

 9. Emphasizes that the right to freedom of expression should be exercised 
with the responsibilities and limitations as prescribed by law and necessary for 
national security and public safety as well as for the prevention of disorder, 
protection of morals and reputation or rights of others and respect for religions and 
beliefs; 

 10. Urges States to take resolute action to prohibit the dissemination of racist 
and xenophobic ideas and material aimed at any religion or its followers that 
constitute incitement or discrimination, hostility or violence;

constitutional systems, adequate protection against acts of hatred, discrimination, 
intimidation and coercion resulting from defamation of religions, to take all possible 
measures to promote tolerance and respect for all religions and their value systems

and to complement legal systems with intellectual and moral strategies to combat 
religious hatred and intolerance; 

 12. Urges all States to ensure that all public officials, including members of 
law enforcement bodies, the military, civil servants and educators, in the course of 
their official duties, respect different religions and beliefs and do not discriminate 
against persons on the grounds of their religion or belief, and that any necessary and 
appropriate education or training is provided;

and harmonizing actions at the local, national, regional and international levels 
through education and awareness-raising;

practice, including access to free primary education for all children, both girls and 
boys, and access for adults to lifelong learning and education based on respect for 
human rights, diversity and tolerance, without discrimination of any kind, and to 
refrain from any legal or other measures leading to racial segregation in access to 
schooling; 

 15. Calls upon the international community to initiate a global dialogue to 
promote a culture of tolerance and peace based on respect for human rights and 
religious diversity, and urges States, non-governmental organizations, religious 
bodies and the print and electronic media to support and promote such a dialogue; 

 16. Affirms that the Human Rights Council, as part of its mandate, shall 
promote universal respect for all religious and cultural values and address instances

promote and include human rights aspects in the dialogue among civilizations, inter 
alia, through:

through educational programmes, particularly the World Programme for Human 
Rights Education proclaimed on 10 December 2004;4  

 (b) Collaboration by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights with other relevant international organizations in holding joint 
conferences designed to encourage this dialogue and promote understanding of the 
universality of human rights and their implementation at various levels; 

 18. Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report on the implementation 
of the present resolution, including on the possible correlation between defamation 
of religions and the upsurge in incitement, intolerance and hatred in many parts of 
the world, to the General Assembly at its sixty-second session.
