and fulfill the commitments set out on inclusivity, including in respect of national 

diversity, gender, youth and regional representation in the Revitalised Agreement,  

 Recognizing the reduction in political violence since the signing of the 

Revitalised Agreement and that the permanent ceasefire was upheld in most parts of 

the country, and further recognizing confidence building measures between 

signatories of the Revitalised Agreement, and the formation of most of the pre-

transitional mechanisms of the Revitalised Agreement,  

 Recalling its resolution 2117 (2013) and expressing grave concern at the threat 

to peace and security in South Sudan arising from the illicit transfer, destabilizing

 Recalling that individuals or entities responsible for or complicit in, or having

capacities, security threats and related information, both within and outside the 

protection of civilians sites, in order to fulfill UNMISS’s protection of civilians 

mandate,  

 Recognizing that unarmed civilian protection can often complement efforts to 

build a protective environment, particularly in the deterrence of sexual and gender -

based violence against civilians, and encouraging UNMISS, as appropriate and when 

possible, to explore how it can use civilian protection techniques, including through 

community engagement and the mission communication strategy, to enhance its

carrying out its mandate to monitor and investigate human rights,  

 Recalling its strong condemnation of all instances of attacks against civilians, 

including those involving violence against women, children, and persons in 

vulnerable situations, ethnically targeted violence, hate speech, and incitements to

political conflict could continue to transform into an outright ethnic war, as noted by 

the Special Advisor for the Prevention of Genocide Adama Dieng,  

 Expressing grave concern at ongoing reports of sexual and gender-based 

violence, particularly against women and girls, including the findings of the report of 

the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict to the Security Counci l 

(S/2018/250) of the use of sexual violence as a tactic by parties to the conflict against 

the civilian population, in South Sudan, including use of rape and gang -rape of 

women and girls, and abduction, forced marriage and sexual slavery, and where 

persistent levels of conflict-related sexual violence and other forms of violence 

against women and girls has become normalized and continued after the signing of 

the Revitalised Agreement and despite the suspension of most military offensives, as 

documented in the February 2019 UNMISS and Office of the United Nations High 

Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) report on conflict-related sexual violence

violations, further condemning harassment, targeting, and censorship of civil society, 

humanitarian personnel and journalists, emphasizing that those responsible for 

violations of international humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human 

rights must be held accountable, and that South Sudan’s government bears the 

primary responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war crimes , ethnic 

cleansing, and crimes against humanity, and expressing concern that despite the

Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children 

in Armed Conflict, strongly calling for its full and immediate implementation, further

parties to conflict, urging all parties to make further efforts to end immediately the 

recruitment of children to armed groups and to release all children that have been

 Taking note of the UNMISS and OHCHR report on the Freedom of Expression 

in South Sudan, and expressing ongoing concern on the severe restriction of freedoms 

of opinion, expression, and association, and condemning the use of media to broadcast 

hate speech and transmit messages instigating violence against a particular ethnic 

group, a practice that has the potential to play a significant role in promoting mass 

violence and exacerbating conflict, and calling on the GoSS to immediately condemn 

and counter increasing hate speech and ethnic violence and to promote reconciliation 

among its people, including through a process of justice and accountability,  

 Expressing serious concern about the dire situation of persons with disabilities 

in South Sudan, including abandonment, violence and lack of access to basic services, 

and emphasizing the need to ensure that the particular needs of persons with 

disabilities are addressed in the humanitarian response,  

 Reiterating the urgent need to end impunity in South Sudan and to hold 

accountable and bring to justice all those responsible for violations of international 

humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human rights, and further stressing the 

importance of accountability, reconciliation and healing in ending impunity and 

ensuring a sustainable peace, as recognized by Chapter V in the Revitalised 

Agreement, and in this regard, sharing the concern of the AUPSC about the delays in 

establishing the Hybrid Court for South Sudan,  

 Expressing grave concern regarding the reports on the human rights situation in 

South Sudan issued by UNMISS and the Secretary-General, as well as the report of 

the AU Commission of Inquiry on South Sudan and the Separate Opinion, expressing 

grave concern that according to some reports, including the AU Commission of 

Inquiry report on South Sudan, released on 27 October 2015, there were reasonable 

grounds to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity had been committed 

and the reports of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, released on 

23 February 2018 and 20 February 2019 that war crimes and crimes against humanity 

may have been committed, emphasizing its hope that these and other credible 

reporting will be duly considered by any transitional justice and reconci liation 

mechanisms for South Sudan including those established in the Revitalised 

Agreement, stressing the importance of collection and preservation of evidence for 

eventual use by the Hybrid Court for South Sudan, and encouraging efforts in this 

regard,

persons and ongoing humanitarian crisis, and an estimated 6.2 million that face severe 

food insecurity according to the February 2019 Integrated Food Security Phase 

Classification report, and 7.1 million in need of life-saving assistance, and that 

2.2 million of the country’s children are out of school, stressing the responsibility 

borne by all parties to the conflict for the immense suffering of the people of South 

Sudan, including the destruction or damage to livelihoods and productive assets, 

commending United Nations humanitarian agencies, partners, and donors for their 

efforts to provide urgent and coordinated support to the population, and calling upon 

the international community to continue these efforts to meet the growing 

humanitarian needs of the people of South Sudan,  

 Condemning the obstructions by all parties to civilians’ movement and to 

humanitarian actors’ movement to reach civilians in need of assistance, expressing 

concern at the imposition of taxes and fees which hamper the delivery of humanitarian 



 
S/2019/225 

 

5/15 19-04435 

 

assistance across the country, and recalling the need for all parties to the conflict to 

allow and facilitate, in accordance with relevant provisions of international law and 

United Nations guiding principles of humanitarian assistance, including humanity, 

impartiality, neutrality, and independence, the full, safe and unhindered access of 

relief personnel, equipment and supplies and timely delivery of humanitarian 

assistance, to all those in need, in particular to IDPs and refugees,  

 Strongly condemning all attacks against humanitarian personnel and facilities 

that resulted in the deaths of at least 112 personnel since December 2013, including 

the attack on the Terrain compound on 11 July 2016 and attacks against medical 

personnel and hospitals, noting with alarm the increasing trend of harassment and 

intimidation of humanitarian personnel, and recalling that attacks against 

humanitarian personnel and objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian 

population may amount to violations of international humanitarian law,  

 Expressing its deep appreciation for the actions taken by UNMISS peacekeepers 

and Troop- and Police-Contributing Countries in implementing the UNMISS mandate 

in a challenging environment, including in protecting civilians, including foreign 

nationals, under threat of physical violence and to stabilize the security situation 

within and beyond UNMISS sites, and stressing that any national caveat that 

negatively affects the implementation of mandate effectiveness should not be 

accepted by the Secretary-General, and further highlighting that lack of effective 

command and control, refusal to obey orders, failure to respond to attacks on 

civilians, inadequate equipment, and financial resources may adversely affect the 

shared responsibility for effective mandate implementation,  

 Welcoming the commitment of the Secretary-General to enforce strictly his zero-

tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse, noting the various measures taken 

by UNMISS and Troop- and Police-contributing countries to combat sexual 

exploitation and abuse, but still expressing grave concern over allegations of sexual 

exploitation and abuse reportedly committed by peacekeepers in South Sudan, 

stressing the urgent need for Troop- and Police-contributing countries and, as 

appropriate, UNMISS, to promptly investigate those allegations in a credible and 

transparent manner and for those responsible for such criminal offences or 

misconduct to be held to account, and further stressing the need to prevent such 

exploitation and abuse and to improve how these allegations are addressed in line 

with resolution 2272 (2016),  

 Recognizing the significant resource and capacity challenges UNMISS faces in 

implementing its mandate, expressing appreciation for UNMISS’s ongoing efforts to 

ensure the safety of IDPs seeking protection on its sites, while recognizing the 

importance of finding sustainable solutions for IDPs in keeping with the Guiding 

Principles on Internal Displacement, and underlining in this regard the need to extend 

its presence, including through proactive deployment and patrolling, to areas of 

displacement, return, and local integration,  

 Emphasizing that persistent barriers to full implementation of resolution 1325 

(2000), and subsequent resolutions on women, peace, and security including 2242 

(2015), will only be dismantled through dedicated commitment to women’s 

empowerment, participation, and human rights, concerted leadership, consistent 

information and action, and support, to build women’s engagement in all levels of 

decision-making, and through ensuring that the full and meaningful participation and 

involvement of women in all spheres and levels of political leadership, the peace 

process, and pre-transitional and transitional government, welcoming the commitment 

to the inclusion of women in the Revitalised Agreement, including the 35% minimum 

for women’s representation, and calling on all parties to do more to ensure that these 

minimum commitments are achieved,
