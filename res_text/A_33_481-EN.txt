in transnational cornorations and in developing countries 

A 

Th~ General Assembly, 

Recalling that, in its resolution 31/197 of 22 December 1976, it requested the 
Secretary-General to ensure that the resources which the United Nations Joint 
Staff Pension Fund holds invested in shares of transnational corporations are 
invested on safe and profitable terms and, to the greatest extent practicable, 
in sound investments in developing countries, 

Recalling also that, in its resolution 32/73 A of 9 December 1977, it requested 
the Secretary-General to redouble his efforts, in pursuance of General Assembly 
resolution 31/197, to ensure that a larger proportion of the investment of the 
resources of the Fund is made in developing countries,

international bodies concerning the new international economic order and 
transnational corporations, 

Reaffirming its belief, expressed in the third preambular paragraph of its 
resolution 31/197 and reiterated in the fourth preambular paragraph of its 
resolution 32/73 A, that investments by the United Nations Joint Staff Pension 
Fund in shares of transnational corporations mir,ht contradict the objectives and 
purposes of the organizations of the United Nations system, 

Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on investments of the 
Uni'~ed Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund with particular reference to developing 
countries,§! 

Observing that, follouing the adoption of General Assembly resolution 31/197, 
investments by the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund in transnational 
corporations amounted to $772 million in bonds and e~uities on 31 March 1977, which 
had declined only to $745 million on 31 l:1arch 1978, while investments made directly 
in developing countries in bonds amounted to only just over $43 million on 
30 June 1978, 

1. Renews its request to the Secretary-General that, in pursuance of General 
Assembly resolutions 31/197 and 32/73 A, he redouble his efforts to ensure that the 
resources which the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund holds invested in shares 
of transnational corporations are reinvested in developing countries to the greatest 
extent practicable and on safe and profitable terms~ 

2. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its 
thirty-fourth session on the implementation of the present resolution.
