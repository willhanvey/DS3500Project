resolution 2467 (2019) of 23 April 2019, 

 Welcoming the work and the reports of the Special Rapporteur on the situation

Government of Myanmar with the mandate, and urging the Government of Myanmar 

to extend full cooperation to the newly appointed Special Rapporteur,  

 Welcoming also the work of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on 

Myanmar, and encouraging her further engagement and dialogue with the 

Government of Myanmar and all other relevant stakeholders, including civil society, 

and affected populations, 

 Welcoming further the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for 

Human Rights on the root causes of the human rights violations and abuses the 

Rohingya and other minorities in Myanmar are facing, and reiterating the importance 

of fully implementing the recommendations contained in the report,  

 Welcoming the work done by the independent international fact-finding mission 

on Myanmar, including its final report10 and all its other reports, including the reports 

on the economic interests of the Myanmar military and on sexual and gender-based 

violence in Myanmar and the gendered impact of its ethnic conflicts, and furthermore 

deeply regretting the lack of cooperation of the Government of Myanmar with the 

fact-finding mission, 

 Alarmed by the findings of the independent international fact-finding mission 

on Myanmar of evidence of gross human rights violations and abuses suffered by 

Rohingya Muslims and other minorities, perpetrated by the security and armed forces 

of Myanmar, which, according to the fact-finding mission, undoubtedly amount to the 

gravest crimes under international law,  

 Expressing deep concern at the limited progress on the fact-finding mission’s 

recommendations to conduct prompt, effective, thorough, independent and impartial 

investigations and to hold perpetrators accountable for crimes committed across 

Myanmar, 

 Concerned that, contrary to the fact-finding mission’s recommendations, laws, 

orders, policies and practices at all levels of Government limiting freedoms of 

movement, expression, association and assembly, or which are discriminatory in their 

application or impact, have not been reviewed, amended or repealed,  

 Welcoming the work of the Independent Mechanism for Myanmar, established 

by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 39/2, to collect, consolidate, preserve 

and analyse evidence of the most serious international crimes and violations of 

international law committed in Myanmar since 2011, in particular in Rakhine, Kachin 

and Shan States, making use of the information handed over by the independent 

international fact-finding mission, and to prepare files in order to facilitate and 

expedite fair and independent criminal proceedings, in accordance with international 

law standards, in national, regional or international courts or tribunals that have, or 

may in the future have, jurisdiction over these crimes, in accordance with 

international law,

 Welcoming also the second report of the Independent Mechanism for Myanmar, 

established by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 39/2, to the General 

Assembly,11 

 Recognizing the complementary and mutually reinforcing work of the various 

United Nations mandate holders and mechanisms, including international justice and 

accountability mechanisms working on Myanmar to improve the situation of human 

rights in Myanmar, 

 Recognizing also the importance of the role of regional organizations in efforts 

to achieve pacific settlement of local disputes, as stipulated in Chapter VIII of the 

Charter, while noting that such efforts do not preclude action under Chapter VI of the 

Charter, 

 Acknowledging the efforts of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, 

alongside relevant international efforts, aimed at bringing peace and stability to 

Rakhine State, including through the work of its Secretary-General’s special envoy 

for Myanmar, 

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General,12 

 Taking note of the ongoing processes to ensure justice and accountability in 

respect of alleged crimes committed against Rohingya Muslims and other minorities 

in Myanmar, 

 Noting that the International Criminal Court has authorized its Prosecutor to 

investigate alleged crimes within the Court’s jurisdiction related to the situation in 

Bangladesh/Myanmar, 

 Welcoming the order of the International Court of Justice of 23 January 2020 

indicating provisional measures in the case lodged by the Gambia against Myanmar 

on the application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime 

of Genocide,13 which concluded that, prima facie, the Court had jurisdiction to deal 

with the case, which found that the Rohingya in Myanmar appeared to constitute a 

“protected group” within the meaning of article 2 of the Convention, and that there 

was a real and imminent risk of irreparable prejudice to the rights of the Rohingya in 

Myanmar, and taking note that Myanmar submitted its report in response to the 

Court’s order on 22 May 2020, and measures adopted in this regard,  

 Noting the publication of the executive summary of the report of the 

Independent Commission of Enquiry established by the Government of Myanmar in 

2018, which, notwithstanding its limitations, acknowledges that war crimes, serious 

human rights violations and violations of domestic law had been committed by 

multiple actors and that there were reasonable grounds to believe that members of 

Myanmar security forces were involved, 

 Condemning all violations and abuses of human rights in Myanmar, including 

against Rohingya Muslims and other minorities, in particular in Rakhine, Chin, 

Kachin and Shan States, and expressing deep concern at the reports of ongoing human 

rights violations, as also noted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 

Rights, 

 Reiterating its deep concern at the violence between the Myanmar armed forces 

and the Arakan Army in Rakhine and Chin States, the continuing forced displacement 

of civilians, including of ethnic minorities, the recruitment and use of children, 

abductions, arbitrary detentions and killings, and the use of facilities functioning as

schools for military purposes and for committing crimes, as well as reports of 

violations and abuses of human rights, including those involving the use of landmines, 

making conditions unsuitable for the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable return 

of all refugees and forcibly displaced persons, including Rohingya,  

 Reiterating the urgent need to ensure that all those responsible for crimes related 

to violations and abuses of international law throughout Myanmar, including 

international human rights law, international humanitarian law and international 

criminal law, are held to account through credible and independen t national, regional 

or international justice mechanisms, while recalling the authority of the Security 

Council in this regard, 

 Expressing deep concern at the reports of violence by the Tatmadaw, which 

disproportionately affects the Rohingya civilians in Rakhine State, where schools, 

religious sites and homes have been targeted,  

 Continuing to underline the need for the security and armed forces of Myanmar 

and other armed groups to cease all actions that run counter to the protection of all 

persons within the country, including those belonging to the Rohingya community, by 

respecting international law, including international human rights law and 

international humanitarian law, and ending the violence, including sexual violence, 

and calling for urgent steps to ensure justice in respect of all human rights violations 

and violations of international humanitarian law so that those displaced by violence 

are able to voluntarily return in safety and dignity to their places of origin or to a 

place of their choice in a sustainable manner, 

 Alarmed at the continued attacks on humanitarian actors, and calling for all sides 

to abide by international law in this matter,  

 Reiterating its deep distress at reports that unarmed individuals in Rakhine State 

have been and continue to be subjected to the excessive use of force and violations of 

human rights and international humanitarian law by the military and security and 

armed forces, including extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary killings, systematic rape 

and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence, arbitrary detention, enforced 

disappearance and government seizure of Rohingya lands from which Rohingya 

Muslims were evicted and their homes destroyed, and remaining concerned by the 

previous large-scale destruction of homes and systematic evictions in northern 

Rakhine State, including the use of arson and violence, as well as the unlawful use of 

force by non-State actors, 

 Expressing concern that, in northern Rakhine State, the implementation of 

policies under the guise of economic development and reconstruction by the 

Government of Myanmar and the heavy militarization of the area have resulted in the 

alteration of the demographic structure, which further prevents the members of the 

displaced Rohingya Muslim population from returning to Rakhine State, 

 Recalling the Secretary-General’s call for a global ceasefire, as supported by 

Security Council resolution 2532 (2020) of 1 July 2020, and regretting that the 

Myanmar armed forces and the Arakan Army have not succeeded to date in 

establishing a bilateral ceasefire in conflict areas in Rakhine and Chin States, while 

stressing the need for continued de-escalation and an enduring ceasefire throughout 

the whole country, best achieved by dialogue between all parties, and encouraging 

them to announce a new ceasefire,  

 Welcoming the organization of the fourth session of the Union Peace Conference 

in August 2020, while calling upon the Government of Myanmar and non-State armed 

groups to accelerate progress in the peace process,

A/C.3/75/L.34 

 

5/12 20-14418 

 

 Reiterating its grave concern that, in spite of the fact that Rohingya Muslims 

lived in Myanmar for generations prior to the independence of Myanmar, held full 

documentation and participated actively in government and civic life, they were made 

stateless by the enactment of the 1982 Citizenship Law and were eventually 

disenfranchised, from 2015, from the electoral process,  

 Reaffirming that the denial of citizenship status and related rights to Rohingya 

Muslims and other minorities, including voting rights, is a serious human rights 

concern, 

 Re-emphasizing the right of all refugees and the importance of internally 

displaced persons being able to return home and that such returns should be in safety 

and dignity and in a voluntary and sustainable manner,  

 Expressing concern at the recent increase in the irregular maritime movement 

of Rohingya, risking their lives in perilous conditions at the hands of exploitative 

smugglers, which highlights their desperate situation and the urgent need to address 

the root causes of their plight,  

 Alarmed by the continued influx to Bangladesh over the last four decades of 

1.1 million Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, including the 860,000 currently living 

there, most of whom arrived since 25 August 2017 in the aftermath of atrocities 

committed by the security and armed forces of Myanmar,  

 Noting the extension for one year of the memorandum of understanding between 

Myanmar and the United Nations Development Programme and the Office of the 

United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on assistance in the repatriation 

process of displaced persons from Rakhine State, and calling upon Myanmar to grant 

United Nations agencies unfettered access to northern Rakhine State so that they can 

carry out this assistance, 

 Recalling some steps taken by the Government of Myanmar to create the 

conditions necessary for refugees and other forcibly displaced persons to return to 

their places of origin or to a place of their choice voluntarily, in safety and dignity, 

but regretting, however, that the situation has not improved in Rakhine State to create 

the conditions necessary for refugees and other forcibly displaced persons to return 

to their places of origin voluntarily, safely and with dignity,  

 Reiterating its deep concern over the continued spread of false news, hate 

speech and inflammatory rhetoric, in particular through social media, not fully 

addressed by the authorities of Myanmar,  

 Underlining the urgency of the call by the Secretary-General for increased 

efforts to implement the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine 

State, to address the root causes of the crisis, including those on access to citizenship 

for the Rohingya, freedom of movement, the elimination of systematic segregation 

and all forms of discrimination, and inclusive and equal access to health services and 

education, and birth registration, in full consultation with members of all ethnic and 

minority groups and persons in vulnerable situations, including on matters of 

citizenship for the Rohingya people,  

 Welcoming the commitment of the Secretary-General to implementing the 

recommendations made by the independent inquiry into the involvement of the United 

Nations in Myanmar from 2010 to 2018, 

 Reiterating its urgent call upon the Government of Myanmar to sustain the 

democratic transition of Myanmar, including by working towards bringing all 

national institutions, including the military, under the democratically elected civilian 

Government, 



A/C.3/75/L.34 
 

 

20-14418 6/12 

 

 Inviting the Government of Myanmar to learn from the challenges of holding 

the 2020 election and create an ongoing system to ensure free, fair, credible, inclusive 

and transparent elections, ensuring equal opportunity for the representation and the 

full, equal and meaningful participation of the Rohingya, other minorities and 

internally displaced persons, candidates and voters and that all people of Myanmar 

are able to cast their vote, allowing all candidates to contest elections fai rly, 

 Welcoming the dialogue between the Government of Myanmar and the United 

Nations on addressing children and armed conflict as well as conflict -related sexual 

and gender-based violence in Myanmar, and the Myanmar National Human Rights 

Commission Strategic Plan (2020–2024), 

 Welcoming also the establishment by the Government of Myanmar of a 

committee for the prevention of grave violations against children in armed conflict, 

looking forward to its concrete results, including the development of a joint action 

plan to end and prevent further killing and maiming of children and rape and other 

forms of sexual violence against children, and welcoming the ratification  of the 

Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of 

children in armed conflict,14 and calling all parties to end violations against children 

in armed conflict, 

 Commending the ongoing humanitarian efforts and commitments that the 

Government of Bangladesh, in cooperation with United Nations agencies and the 

international community, including all humanitarian actors, has extended to those 

fleeing human rights violations and abuses in Myanmar,  

 Welcoming the involvement of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in 

addressing the situation in Rakhine State, including through carrying out 

humanitarian assessments in northern Rakhine State through its Coordinating Centre 

for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management in May 2019, and its 

establishment of an ad hoc support team to implement the recommendations of the 

preliminary needs assessment of repatriation conditions in Rakhine State, recognizing 

the need for closer engagement with the Rohingya refugee community, while 

encouraging close cooperation with all relevant United Nations agencies and 

international partners to address the root causes of the conflict, so that affected 

communities can rebuild their lives there,  

 Noting with concern the exacerbation of the existing humanitarian situation and 

the negative impact on the human rights situation in Myanmar,  including access to 

education, following the global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, stressing 

that measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic must be targeted, necessary, 

transparent, non-discriminatory, time-bound, proportionate and in accordance with 

obligations under applicable international human rights law,  

 Recognizing the efforts of the Government of Myanmar to contain the spread of 

the COVID-19 virus and to balance the severe socioeconomic effects of the pandemic 

by setting up a COVID-19 economic relief plan and providing financial assistance to 

people especially affected by the crisis, while expressing its concern that the capacity 

of humanitarian and development actors to implement their programmes has been 

significantly reduced at a time when vulnerable parts of the population are in 

particular need of assistance and that, therefore, resources may be shifted away from 

Myanmar, and stressing the need to ensure access to COVID-19-related information, 

supplies and medical services, 

 1. Expresses grave concern at continuing reports of serious human rights 

violations and abuses by the military and security forces as well as violations of

A/C.3/75/L.34 

 

7/12 20-14418 

 

international humanitarian law in Myanmar against Rohingya and other minorities, in 

particular in Kachin, Rakhine, southern Chin and Shan States, including those 

involving arbitrary arrests, deaths in detention, torture and other cruel, inhuman or 

degrading treatment or punishment, deliberate killing and maiming of children, 

recruitment and use of children for forced labour, indiscriminate shelling in civilian 

areas, destruction and burning of homes, deprivation of economic and social rights, 

the forced displacement of over 860,000 Rohingya and other minorities to 

Bangladesh, rape, sexual slavery and other forms of sexual and gender-based 

violence, as well as restrictions on exercising the rights to freedom of religion or 

belief, expression and peaceful assembly, and restrictions on media freedom and full 

Internet access and other restrictions;  

 2. Strongly condemns all violations and abuses of human rights in Myanmar, 

and emphasizes the importance of conducting international, independent, fair and 

transparent investigations into the gross human rights violations in Myanmar, 

including sexual and gender-based violence and violations and abuses against women 

and children, and of holding accountable all those responsible for brutal acts and 

crimes against all persons, including Rohingya, in order to deliver justice to victims 

using all legal instruments and domestic, regional and international judicial 

mechanisms, including the International Court of Justice and the International 

Criminal Court, as applicable; 

 3. Calls upon the security and armed forces of Myanmar and other armed 

groups, in particular in Rakhine, Chin and Shan States, to heed the Secretary 

General’s calls for a global ceasefire, end all hostilities and address grievances 

through political dialogue; 

 4. Takes note of the order of the International Court of Justice of 23 January 

2020 indicating provisional measures, and urges the Government of Myanmar, in 

accordance with the Court’s order in relation to members of the Rohingya in its 

territory, to take all measures within its power to prevent the commission of all acts 

within the scope of article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of 

the Crime of Genocide, to ensure that its military and any irregular armed units that 

may be directed or supported by it and any organizations and persons that may be 

subject to its control, direction or influence do not commit, inter alia, any such acts, 

to prevent the destruction and ensure the preservation of evidence and to report to the 

Court as ordered on all measures taken to give effect to the order;  

 5. Expresses grave concern about the ongoing restrictions on humanitarian 

access in all conflict areas, in particular in Rakhine and Chin States, as well as the 

limited steps taken to ensure access to health care for the Rohingya, particularly in 

the time of COVID-19, and urges the Government of Myanmar to cooperate fully 

with and to grant full, unrestricted and unmonitored access to all United Nations 

mandate holders and human rights mechanisms, including the Special Rapporteur on 

the situation of human rights in Myanmar, the United Nations country task forc e on 

monitoring and reporting grave violations committed against children, the 

Independent Mechanism for Myanmar, established by the Human Rights Council in 

its resolution 39/2, and relevant United Nations agencies and international and 

regional human rights bodies to independently monitor the situation of human rights 

and to ensure that individuals can cooperate without hindrance with these mechanisms 

and without fear of reprisal, intimidation or attack,  and expresses deep concern that 

international access to affected areas of northern Rakhine State remains severely 

restricted for the international community, including for United Nations agencies, 

humanitarian actors and international media;  

 6. Calls upon the United Nations to ensure that the Independent Mechanism 

for Myanmar, as established by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 39/2, is

afforded the flexibility that it needs in terms of staffing, location and operational 

freedom so that it can deliver as effectively as possible on its mandate, and urges 

Myanmar, Member States, judicial authorities and private entities to cooperate fully 

with the Mechanism, including by granting it access and by providing it with every 

assistance in the execution of its mandate;  

 7. Expresses grave concern at the potential retraumatization of survivors of 

human rights violations and abuses, particularly child survivors and sexual violence 

survivors, and calls upon all actors engaging in documentation to follow the “do no 

harm” principle for evidence gathering in order to respect the dignity of survivors and 

to avoid retraumatization, and calls upon Myanmar to fully address the needs of 

victims and survivors and their right to effective remedy, including through prompt, 

effective and independent casualty recording and guarantees of non-recurrence; 

 8. Reiterates the urgent call upon the Government of Myanmar:  

 (a) To end immediately all violence and all violations of international law in 

Myanmar, to ensure the protection of the human rights of all persons in Myanmar, 

including of Rohingya and persons belonging to other minorities, and to take all 

measures necessary to provide justice to victims, to ensure full accountability and to 

end impunity for all violations and abuses of human rights law and violations of 

international humanitarian law, starting with a full, transparent and independent 

investigation into reports of all these violations, and calls upon the President of 

Myanmar to release the report of the Independent Commission of Enquiry established 

by the Government of Myanmar in 2018 in full or to share its findings with relevant 

international mechanisms; 

 (b) To manifest clear political will supported by concrete actions for the safe, 

dignified, voluntary and sustainable return and reintegration of Rohingya Muslims in 

Myanmar; 

 (c) To create the conditions necessary for the safe, voluntary, dignified and 

sustainable return of all refugees, including Rohingya Muslim refugees, particularly 

in view of the fact that not a single Rohingya so far has returned through a bilaterally 

set up mechanism for repatriation between Bangladesh and Myanmar owing to the 

failure of the Government of Myanmar to create such conditions in Rakhine State; 

 (d) To build trust among Rohingya Muslims in camps in Bangladesh through 

confidence-building measures, including direct communication between the Rohingya 

representatives and the Myanmar authorities and by arranging “go and see” visits to 

Rakhine State by Rohingya representatives;  

 (e) To ensure full protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms 

of all persons in Myanmar, including Rohingya Muslims and other minorities, in an 

equal, non-discriminatory and dignified manner, in order to prevent further instability 

and insecurity, alleviate suffering, address the root causes of the crisis, including by
