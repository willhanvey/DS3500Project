  Promotion of equitable geographical distribution in the

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions on this question,  

 Reaffirming the importance of the goal of universal ratification of the United 

Nations human rights instruments,  

 Welcoming the significant increase in the number of ratifications of United 

Nations human rights instruments and the movement of some treaties towards 

universal ratification, 

 Reiterating the importance of the effective functioning of the treaty bodies 

established pursuant to United Nations human rights instruments for the full and 

effective implementation of those instruments,  

 Recognizing that the equitable geographical distribution of membership is an 

essential requirement for the effective functioning of the treaty bodies,  

 Recalling that, with regard to the election of the members of the human rights 

treaty bodies, the General Assembly and the former Commission on Human Rights 

recognized the importance of giving consideration in their membership to equitable 

geographical distribution, gender balance and representation of the principal legal 

systems and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and shall serve in 

their personal capacity, and shall be of high moral character, acknowledged 

impartiality and recognized competence in the field of human rights,  

 * On behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the Movement of

 Reaffirming the significance of national and regional particularities and 

various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds,  as well as of different 

political, economic and legal systems,  

 Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General,
1
 

 Recognizing that the United Nations pursues multilingualism as a means of 

promoting, protecting and preserving diversity of languages and  cultures globally 

and that genuine multilingualism promotes unity in diversity and international 

understanding, 

 Recalling that the General Assembly and the former Commission on Human 

Rights encouraged States parties to United Nations human rights treatie s, 

individually and through meetings of States parties, to consider how to give better 

effect, inter alia, to the principle of equitable geographical distribution in the 

membership of treaty bodies, 

 Expressing its deep concern at the regional imbalance in the current 

composition of the membership of the human rights treaty bodies in favour in 

particular of representatives of members from Western European and other States, 

as indicated and highlighted in the report of the Secretary-General,  

 Reaffirming the importance of increasing efforts to address that imbalance,  

 Convinced that the goal of equitable geographical distribution in the 

membership of human rights treaty bodies is perfectly compatible and can be fully 

realized and achieved in harmony with the need to achieve gender balance and the 

representation of the principal legal systems in those bodies and the high moral 

character, acknowledged impartiality and recognized competence in the field of 

human rights of their members,  

 1. Reiterates that the States parties to the United Nations human rights 

instruments should take into account, in their nomination of members to the human 

rights treaty bodies, that these committees shall be composed of persons of high 

moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights, 

consideration being given to the usefulness of the participation of persons having 

legal experience and to equal representation of women and men, and that members 

shall serve in their personal capacity, and also reiterates that, in the elections to the 

human rights treaty bodies, strong consideration shall be given to equitable 

geographical distribution of membership and to the representation of the different 

forms of civilization and of the principal legal systems;  

 2. Urges the States parties to the United Nations human rights instruments, 

including the bureau members, to include this matter in the agenda of each meeting 

and/or conference of States parties to those instruments in order to initiate a debate 

on ways and means to ensure equitable geographical distribution in the membership 

of the human rights treaty bodies, based on previous recommendations of the former 

Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and Social Council and the 

provisions of the present resolution;  

 3. Encourages the States parties to the United Nations human rights 

instruments to consider and adopt concrete actions, inter alia, the possible 

establishment of quotas by geographical region for membership of the treaty bodies,

thereby ensuring the paramount objective of equitable geographical distribution in 

the membership of those human rights bodies; 

 4. Recommends, when considering the possible allocation of seats on each 

treaty body on a regional basis, the introduction of flexible procedures that 

encompass the following criteria: 

 (a) Each of the five regional groups established by the General Assembly is 

allocated seats on each treaty body in equivalent proportion to the number of States 

parties to the instrument in that group;  

 (b) There must be provision for periodic revisions of the allocation of seats 

in order to reflect relative changes in the level of treaty ratification in each regional 

group; 

 (c) Automatic periodic revisions should be envisaged in order to avoid 

amending the text of the instrument when the quotas are revised;  

 5. Stresses that the process needed to achieve the goal of equitable 

geographical distribution in the membership of human rights treaty bodies can 

contribute to raising awareness of the importance of gender balance, the 

representation of the principal legal systems and the principle that the members of 

the treaty bodies shall be elected and shall serve in their personal capacity, and shall 

be of high moral character, acknowledged impartiality and recognized competence 

in the field of human rights; 

 6. Requests the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Office of the 

United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, to submit to the General 

Assembly at its seventy-second session a comprehensive updated report in this 

regard, including information on any steps taken by States parties at meet ings or 

conferences of States parties to address the matter of equitable geographical 

distribution in the membership of the human rights treaty bodies, as well as concrete 

recommendations on the implementation of the present resolution;  

 7. Decides to continue its consideration of the question at its seventy-

second session under the item entitled “Promotion and protection of human rights”.
