 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling the obligations of all Member States under Article 2 of the Charter of 

the United Nations, 

 Recalling also its resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970, in which it 

approved the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly 

Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United 

Nations,  

 Reaffirming the need for all Member States to adhere strictly to the principles 

of the Charter, which include the sovereign equality of all Members of the United 

Nations, the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial 

integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent 

with the purposes of the United Nations, and the obligation to settle international 

disputes by peaceful means,  

 Referring to its relevant resolutions on cooperation between the United Nations 

and the Organization for Democracy and Economic Development — GUAM aimed, 

inter alia, at promoting the purposes and principles of the United Nations in the 

GUAM area, 

 Bearing in mind that the Constitution of the Republic of Moldova proclaims the 

permanent neutrality of the country and expressly prohibits the stationing of foreign 

troops on its territory, 

 Recognizing that the stationing of foreign military forces on the territory of the 

Republic of Moldova, without its consent, violates its sovereignty and territorial 

integrity, and that this is a problem that must be resolved in good faith, 

unconditionally, without further delay and in a peaceful manner,  

 Recalling the repeated past calls of the Republic of Moldova, which were 

reiterated at the twenty-fourth meeting of the Organization for Security and 

 

 * Reissued for technical reasons on 19 June 2018.

18-09668 2/2 

 

Cooperation in Europe Ministerial Council, held in Vienna in December 2017, for the 

full withdrawal of Russian military forces and armaments from its territory,  

 Noting with appreciation the efforts made by the States participating in the 

Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe aimed at facilitating the 

completion of the withdrawal process of the Russian military forces and armaments 

from the territory of the Republic of Moldova, in accordance with the relevant 

decisions of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, 

 Emphasizing the commitment by the Russian Federation to complete the 

withdrawal of its military forces and armaments from the territory of the Republic of 

Moldova within a specific timetable, as agreed at the summit of the Organization for 

Security and Cooperation in Europe held in Istanbul, Turkey, in 1999,  

 Recalling its relevant resolutions on cooperation between the United Nations 

and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, particularly resolutions 

54/117 of 15 December 1999, 55/179 of 19 December 2000, 56/216 of 21 December 

2001 and 57/298 of 20 December 2002, and emphasizing the commitments 

undertaken by the Russian Federation at the Organization for Security and 

Cooperation in Europe summit held in Istanbul in 1999 on the withdrawal of its 

military forces and armaments from the territory of the Republic of Moldova,  

 Stressing that the Operational Group of Russian Forces is not a part of the 

military component of the Joint Control Commission, established under the 1992 

ceasefire agreement, which also includes a rotating Russian contingent, and, as such, 

has not been entrusted with any peacekeeping or other legal mandate,  

 Taking note with concern of the continuous illegal joint military exercises of the 

Operational Group of Russian Forces with the paramilitaries of the separatist entity 

in the eastern part of the country, which endangers the security situation, disregards 

the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova and undermines 

the international efforts aimed at the peaceful resolution of the protracted 

Transnistrian conflict, 

 Recognizing that the completion of the withdrawal of the Operational Group of 

Russian Forces, and the armaments that it guards, from the territory of the Republic 

of Moldova will demonstrate respect for its sovereignty, territorial integrity and 

permanent neutrality, 

 1. Expresses deep concern about the continued stationing of the Operational 

Group of Russian Forces and its armaments on the territory of the Republic of 

Moldova without the consent of that State Member of the United Nations;  

 2. Urges the Russian Federation to complete, unconditionally and without 

further delay, the orderly withdrawal of the Operational Group of Russian Forces and 

its armaments from the territory of the Republic of Moldova;  

 3. Expresses support for and further encourages the facilitation by the States 

participating in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe of the 

completion of the process of withdrawal of the Russian forces and armaments from 

the territory of the Republic of Moldova, in accordance with the relevant decisions of 

the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and as agreed at its summit 

held in Istanbul in 1999; 

 4. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-third session 

an item entitled “Complete withdrawal of foreign military forces from the territory of 

the Republic of Moldova”.
