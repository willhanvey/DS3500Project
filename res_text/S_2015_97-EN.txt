  United States of America: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions and statements of its President concerning 

Sudan, 

 Reaffirming its commitment to the cause of peace throughout Sudan, to the 

sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Sudan, and to the full 

and timely implementation of resolution 1591 (2005), and recalling the importance 

of the principles of good neighbourliness, non-interference and cooperation in the 

relations among States in the region, and recalling that the Government of Sudan 

bears the primary responsibility for protecting all populations within its territory, 

with respect for the rule of law, international human rights law and international 

humanitarian law, 

 Reiterating the need for an end to the violence and continued abuses in Darfur, 

underscoring the importance of fully addressing the root causes of the conflict in 

the search for a sustainable peace, and recognizing that the Darfur conflict cannot be 

resolved militarily and a durable solution can only be obtained through an inclusive 

political process, 

 Noting the importance of the work of the African Union High-Level 

Implementation Panel (AUHIP), the aims of the Doha Document for Peace in 

Darfur (DDPD), and the stated commitment of the Government of Sudan to an 

inclusive national dialogue building on the AUHIP’s ongoing peace efforts, and 

calling for an environment conducive to that national dialogue,  

 Expressing deep concern at the increased violence and insecurity in Dar fur in 

recent months, including fighting between the government and armed groups and 

inter-communal fighting, expressing deep concern that such violence has had an 

adverse effect on the security situation, has contributed to the significant increase in 

the number of internally displaced persons observed in 2014, and continues to 

restrict humanitarian access to conflict areas where vulnerable civilian populations 

reside, and reaffirming the crucial need to address the urgent humanitarian crisis 

faced by the people of Darfur, including by facilitating safe, timely and unhindered 

humanitarian access to all areas by humanitarian agencies and personnel, consistent 

with the United Nations guiding principles of humanitarian assistance, including 

humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence, and the relevant provisions of 

international law,

violence against civilians, in particular members of vulnerable groups such as women 

and children, and to end all violations and abuses of human rights and violations of 

international humanitarian law, and further emphasizing that some of these acts may 

amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity under international law,  

 Expressing concern about the external links, in particular military, between 

non-signatory armed groups in Darfur and groups outside Darfur, and demanding 

that direct or indirect military support for such armed groups in Darfur ceases, and 

condemning actions by any armed group aimed at forced overthrow of the 

Government of Sudan, noting there is no military solution to the conflict in Sudan,  

 Demanding that the parties to the conflict exercise restraint and cease military 

action of all kind, including aerial bombardments,  

 Recalling its resolution 2117 (2013) and expressing concern at the threat to 

peace and security in Darfur arising from the illicit transfer, destabilizing 

accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons, and the use of such 

weapons against civilians affected by armed conflict, and the continued threats to 

civilians posed by unexploded ordnance, 

 Deploring the continued violations of resolution 1591 (2005) by the 

Government of Sudan, including its Rapid Support Forces (RSF), and government -

affiliated armed groups involving the routine movement of weapons and 

ammunition into Darfur, without prior authorization of the 1591 committee,  

 Demanding an immediate and complete cessation by all parties to the armed 

conflict of all acts of sexual violence against civilians, recruitment and use of 

children in violation of applicable international law, other violations and abuses 

against children, and indiscriminate attacks on civilians, in line with all relevant 

resolutions on these issues, 

 Reaffirming its concern over the negative effect of ongoing violence in Darfur 

on the stability of Sudan as a whole, as well as the region, welcoming the ongoing 

good relations between Sudan and Chad, and encouraging Sudan and the countries 

of the region to continue to cooperate in order to achieve peace and stability in 

Darfur and the wider region, 

 Deploring the violations of international humanitarian law and human rights 

violations and abuses committed by Government of Sudan security forces, their 

proxies, and armed groups, including those opposing the Government of Sudan, 

especially at the Khor Abeche Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp and at 

Taweisha, North Darfur, as reported by the Panel of Experts,  

 Expresses concern at the continued obstacles imposed by the Government of 

Sudan on the work of the Panel of Experts during the course of its mandate, 

including restrictions to the freedom of movement of the Panel of Experts, and 

limitations on access to areas of armed conflict and areas of reported violations and 

abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law,  

 Welcoming improved cooperation between the Government of Sudan and the 

Panel of Experts, encouraging increased cooperation by the Government of Sudan 

to accede to requests from the Panel for access to areas of armed conflict and for 

information, and reiterating its call on all parties in Darfur to cooperate fully with 

the mission, including by ensuring its free and unfettered access,

concerning privileges and immunities, and the Convention on the Privileges and 

Immunities of the United Nations, as applicable to United Nations operations and 

persons engaged in such operations, 

 Noting the critical importance of effective implementation of the sanctions 

regime, including the key role that neighbouring states, as well as regional and 

subregional organizations can play in this regard, and encouraging efforts to further 

enhance cooperation, 

 Reminding all States, particularly States in the region, including the 

Government of Sudan, of the obligations contained in resolutions 1556 (2004), 1591 

(2005), and 1945 (2010), in particular those obligations relating to arms and related 

materiel, 

 Calling on the Government of Sudan to fulfil all its commitments, including 

lifting the state of emergency in Darfur, allowing free expression and undertaking 

effective efforts to ensure accountability for violations and abuses of human rights 

and violations of international humanitarian law, by whomsoever perpetrated, 

 Noting that acts of hostility, violence or intimidation against the civilian 

population, including Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), in Darfur, endanger or 

undermine the Parties’ commitment to a complete and durable cessation of 

hostilities, and would be inconsistent with the aims of the DDPD,

international peace and security in the region,
