 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 194 (III) of 11 December 1948 and all its subsequent 

resolutions on the question, including resolution 68/76 of 11 December 2013,  

 Recalling also its resolution 302 (IV) of 8 December 1949, by which, inter 

alia, it established the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine 

Refugees in the Near East, 

 Recalling further the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,  

 Aware of the fact that, for more than six decades, the Palestine refugees have 

suffered from the loss of their homes, lands and means of livelihood,  

 Affirming the imperative of resolving the problem of the Palestine refugees for 

the achievement of justice and for the achievement of lasting peace in the region,  

 Acknowledging the essential role that the Agency has played for over 60 years 

since its establishment in ameliorating the plight of the Palestine refugees through 



A/C.4/69/L.9

the provision of education, health, relief and social services and ongoing work in the

 Aware of the continuing needs of the Palestine refugees throughout all the 

fields of operation, namely, Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic and the 

Occupied Palestinian Territory, 

 Expressing grave concern at the especially difficult situation of the Palestine 

refugees under occupation, including with regard to their safety, well -being and 

socioeconomic living conditions, 

 Expressing grave concern in particular at the grave humanitarian situation and 

socioeconomic conditions of the Palestine refugees in the Gaza Strip, and 

underlining the importance of emergency and humanitarian assistance and urgent 

reconstruction efforts, 

 Noting the signing of the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government 

Arrangements on 13 September 19932 by the Government of Israel and the Palestine 

Liberation Organization and the subsequent implementation agreements , 

 1. Notes with regret that repatriation or compensation of the refugees, as 

provided for in paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), has not yet 

been effected, and that, therefore, the situation of the Palestine refugees continues to 

be a matter of grave concern and the Palestine refugees continue to require 

assistance to meet basic health, education and living needs;  

 2. Also notes with regret that the United Nations Conciliation Commission for 

Palestine has been unable to find a means of achieving progress in the implementation 

of paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), and reiterates its request to 

the Conciliation Commission to continue exerting efforts towards the implementation 

of that paragraph and to report to the Assembly on the efforts being exerted in this 

regard as appropriate, but no later than 1 September 2015; 

 3. Affirms the necessity for the continuation of the work of the United 

Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and the 

importance of its unimpeded operation and its provision of services, including 

emergency assistance, for the well-being, protection and human development of the 

Palestine refugees and for the stability of the region, pending the just resolution of 

the question of the Palestine refugees;  

 4. Calls upon all donors to continue to strengthen their efforts to meet the 

anticipated needs of the Agency, including with regard to increased expenditures 

arising from conflicts and instability in the region and the serious socioeconomic 

and humanitarian situation, particularly in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and 

those needs mentioned in recent emergency, recovery and reconstruction appeals 

and plans for the Gaza Strip and in the regional crisis response plans to address the 

situation of Palestine refugees in the Syrian Arab Republic and those Palestine 

refugees who have fled to countries in the region;
