 Commending the continued assistance provided to the parties by the African 

Union (AU), the AU High Level Implementation Panel (AUHIP), the 

Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the Federal Democratic Republic of 

Ethiopia, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Sudan and South Sudan, 

whose responsibilities will be taken over by the Special Envoy of the Secretary -

General for the Horn of Africa, and the United Nations Interim Security Force for 

Abyei (UNISFA),  

 Acknowledging that over the course of the seven years since establishment of 

UNISFA, the mission has been able to stabilize and demilitarize the Abyei Area and 

that UNISFA is now an interim security force with no viable exit strategy, and in this 

regard, taking note of the need to reconfigure the mission in order to create the space 

for a viable political process that would also serve as an exit strategy,  

 Noting that over the course of seven years the Government of Sudan and the 

Government of South Sudan have not made meaningful progress on the pol itical 

process outlined in the 2011 and 2012 agreements listed above, including the failure 

to hold regular meetings of the Abyei Joint Oversight Committee and to establish the 

Abyei Area Administration, and the Abyei Police Service,  

 Emphasizing the change in threat in the Abyei Area as characterized by the 

20 August 2018 Secretary-General’s letter (S/2018/778), and taking note of the 

security situation in the Abyei Area as characterized by the 15 October 2018  

Secretary-General’s report (S/2018/923),  

 Commending the UN Police for activities to advise and mentor the local 

population in absence of the Abyei Police Service, urging both parties to establish the 

Abyei Police Service, welcoming UNISFA’s enhanced role in fostering 

intercommunal dialogue, and urging all parties to continue these dialogues,  

 Commending the efforts of UNISFA in effectively carrying out its mandate, 

including by its ongoing facilitation of peaceful migration throughout the Abyei Area, 

conflict prevention, mediation and deterrence, and strongly underscoring the 

unacceptability of any attack on United Nations personnel, and reiterating that such 

attacks, which may constitute a war crime, should be swiftly and thoroughly 

investigated, and that those responsible should be held to account,  

 Recalling that the Security Council welcomed in resolution 2205 (2015) the 

decision of the Secretary-General to appoint a civilian head of mission,  

 Bearing in mind that people in the Abyei Area continue to rely on humanitarian 

assistance, that access for humanitarian organizations to reach people in need remains 

of crucial importance, and that humanitarian actors continue to provide assistance to 

182,000 people in the Abyei Area,  

 Recalling resolution 2378 (2017) and its request of the Secretary-General to 

ensure that data related to the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations, including 

peacekeeping performance data, is used to improve analytics and the evaluation of 

mission operations, based on clear and well identified benchmarks, and further 

recalling resolution 2436 (2018) and its request of the Secretary-General to ensure 

that decisions to recognize and incentivize outstanding performance and decisions 

regarding deployment, remediation, training, withholding of financial 

reimbursement, and repatriation of uniformed or dismissal of civilian personnel, are 

predicated on objective performance data,  

 Further recalling resolutions 1325 (2000) and subsequent resolutions on 

women, peace, and security and emphasizing that persistent barriers to full 

implementation of these resolutions will only be dismantled through dedicated 

commitment to women’s empowerment, participation, and human rights, and through

 Expressing concern about the residual threat of landmines and explosive 

remnants of war in the Abyei Area, which hinders the safe return of displaced persons

security,

of resolution 2075 (2012), further recalls its decision in resolution 2438 (2018) that 

such extension shall be the final extension of support to the Joint Border Verification 

and Monitoring Mechanism (JBVMM) unless both parties demonstrate measurable 

progress as outlined in paragraph 3 of resolution 2438 (2018), and calls on the parties 

to take those steps;  

 3. Decides to reduce the authorized troop ceiling to 4,140 until 15 May 2019,

paragraph 4, and also decides that as of 15 April 2019, the authorized troop ceiling

ceiling of 345, demands that the Governments of Sudan and South Sudan provide full

make progress towards a political solution,  

 6. Expresses its intention to continue revising as appropriate the 

configuration and mandate of UNISFA in light of recommendations from the 

Secretary General, including recommendations contained in the 22 April 2018 and 

20 August 2018 letters, and based on progress towards implementation of the 

Cooperation Agreements of 27 September 2012 and settlement of the final status of 

Abyei in a manner consistent with the CPA;

taken towards the following:

26 October 2013 and 6 February 2018,  

  2. Implementation of all Abyei Joint Oversight Committee (AJOC)

peace processes;  

 10. Welcomes renewed efforts to determine conclusively the Safe

the borders;  

 11. Underscores that UNISFA’s protection of civilians mandate as set out in

civilians under imminent threat of physical violence, irrespective of the source of 

such violence, and in that regard underlines that peacekeepers are authorized to use

administration in Abyei and the Misseriya administration in Muglad, using

reconciliation, and facilitate the return of displaced persons to their village and the 

delivery of services;
