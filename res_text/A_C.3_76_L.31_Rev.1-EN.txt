A/C.3/76/L.31/Rev.1 

 

3/20 21-16469 

 

 Deploring the fact that March 2021 marked 10 years since the peaceful uprising 

and its brutal repression that led to the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, which 

has had a devastating impact on civilians, including through grave violations and 

abuses of international human rights law and violations of international humanitarian 

law, 

 Strongly condemning the grave human rights situation in the Syrian Arab 

Republic, the indiscriminate killing and deliberate targeting of civilians, including 

humanitarian workers, including those involving the continued indiscriminate use of 

heavy weapons and aerial bombardments, which has caused more than 500,000 

fatalities, including the killing of more than 29,000 children, the continued 

widespread and systematic gross violations, as well as abuses, of human rights and 

violations of international humanitarian law, including by the starvation of civilians 

as a method of warfare and the use of chemical weapons, including sarin and chlorine 

gas, and sulfur mustard, which are prohibited under international law, and acts of 

violence by the Syrian regime that foment sectarian tensions within the Syrian 

population, 

 Noting with grave concern that the Office of the United Nations High 

Commissioner for Human Rights has identified 350,209 individuals by full name, 

together with an established date of death and location, who were killed in the conflict 

in the Syrian Arab Republic between March 2011 to March 2021 and that, of those 

identified, 26,727 were women and 27,126 were children, recalling  also that the list 

compiled by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 

indicates a minimum verifiable number and is certainly an undercount of the actual 

number of killings, 

 Reiterating that the only sustainable solution to the current crisis in the Syrian 

Arab Republic is through an inclusive and Syrian-led political process, under the 

auspices of the United Nations, that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian 

people in line with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), with a view to 

establishing credible, inclusive and non-sectarian governance, with the full, equal and 

meaningful participation and leadership of all women and youth at all levels, 

welcoming the establishment of the Constitutional Committee, reaffirming in this 

regard the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and 

in peacebuilding, stressing the importance of their full, equal and meaningful 

participation and involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of 

peace and security and their role in decision-making with regard to conflict prevention 

and resolution, and recognizing the work carried out by the Special Envoy of the 

Secretary-General for Syria to that end, 

 Recalling its demand that all parties take all appropriate steps to protect 

civilians, including members of ethnic and religious communities,  

 Welcoming the efforts of the Special Envoy to advance United Nations efforts 

to achieve a sustainable political solution to the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic 

in line with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), recalling the importance of 

advancing the work of the Constitutional Committee and achieving tangible results, 

and in that regard urging all parties to engage meaningfully in the work of the 

Constitutional Committee, particularly the Syrian regime, and underlining that a 

political solution to the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic requires  full 

implementation of all aspects of resolution 2254 (2015), including the holding of free 

and fair elections, under the supervision of the United Nations, to the satisfaction of 

the governance and to the highest international standards of transparency and 

accountability, with all Syrians, including displaced persons, refugees and members 

of the diaspora, eligible to participate, as well as the establishment of a neutral and 

safe environment, noting that the recent presidential elections held in Syria were

neither free, fair, nor consistent with the political process called for by Security 

Council resolution 2254 (2015), 

 Reconfirming its endorsement of the Geneva communiqué of 30 June 2012, 33 

endorsing the joint statement on the outcome of the multilateral talks on Syria held in 

Vienna of 30 October 2015 and the statement of the International Syria Support Group 

of 14 November 2015 (the Vienna statements) in pursuit of the full implementation 

of the Geneva communiqué, facilitated by the Special Envoy, as the basis for a 

Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political transition in order to end the conflict in the 

Syrian Arab Republic, and stressing that the Syrian people will decide the future of 

the Syrian Arab Republic, 

 Welcoming the call made by the Secretary-General for a global ceasefire and 

that of the Special Envoy for a complete, immediate and nationwide ceasefire 

throughout the Syrian Arab Republic, as endorsed by the Security Council in its 

resolutions 2532 (2020) of 1 July 2020 and 2565 (2021) of 26 February 2021, and 

reaffirming that Member States must ensure that any measures taken to counter 

terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, in particular 

international human rights law, international refugee law and international 

humanitarian law, while continuing to support legitimate counter-terrorism operations 

against Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as Da’esh), Al -Qaida 

and Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (formerly known as the Nusrah Front), and all other 

individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida or ISIL, and 

other terrorist groups, which have been designated by the Security Council,  

 Urging all parties, particularly the Syrian regime, to engage meaningfully in the 

political process under the auspices of the Special Envoy and his office in Geneva, in 

line with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), and including the full, equal and 

meaningful participation and representation of women in all efforts and decisions, 

welcoming the resumption of the Syrian-led and Syrian-owned Constitutional 

Committee convened and facilitated by the Special Envoy in Geneva from 18 to 

22 October 2021, urging the regime to engage in the United Nations-facilitated 

Constitutional Committee in line with the agreed terms of reference and rules of 

procedure, reaffirming the importance of the full implementation of the women, peace 

and security agenda of the Security Council, pursuant to Security Council resolution 

1325 (2000), and its nine subsequent resolutions, in this regard, and welcoming the 

inclusion of civil society in the political process, in particular through the Civil 

Society Support Room and Syrian Women’s Advisory Board,  

 Noting with deep concern the culture of impunity from within the Syrian regime 

for the most serious violations of international law and violations and abuses of 

human rights law committed during the present conflict, some of which rise to the 

level of war crimes and crimes against humanity, which has provided a fertile ground 

for further violations and abuses,  

 Emphasizing the importance of accountability for the most serious crimes in 

violation of international law committed during the conflict for ensuring sustainable 

peace, 

 Recalling all relevant resolutions on the safety and security of humanitarian 

personnel and the protection of United Nations personnel, including its resolution 

73/137 of 14 December 2018, as well as Security Council resolutions on the 

protection of humanitarian personnel, including resolutions 2175 (2014) of 29 August 

2014 and 2286 (2016) of 3 May 2016, the relevant statements by the President of the 

Security Council referring to the specific obligations under international 

humanitarian law to respect and protect, in situations of armed conflict, all medical

against hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected, including 

makeshift hospitals, as well as attacks against medical personnel and humanitarian 

workers that are in violation of international humanitarian law,  

 Expressing grave concern at the continued indiscriminate use of force by the 

Syrian regime against civilians, which continues to cause immense human suffering 

and fomented the spread of violent extremism and violent extremist groups and which 

demonstrates the continuing failure of the Syrian regime to protect the population and 

implement the relevant resolutions and decisions of United Nations bodies and has 

created a safe haven and operating environment for perpetrators of war crimes and 

crimes against humanity, 

 Expressing grave concern also at the remaining presence of violent extremism 

and violent extremist groups, terrorists and terrorist groups, and strongly condemning 

all violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian 

law committed in the Syrian Arab Republic by any party to the conflict, in particular 

ISIL (also known as Da’esh), Al-Qaida-affiliated terrorist groups, armed groups and 

non-State actors, and also the Syrian regime and its allies,  

 Noting with serious concern the findings of the Independent International 

Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic that non-State armed groups still 

resort to the use of force against civilians,  

 Expressing support for the work carried out by the Independent International 

Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, welcoming its reports, strongly 

condemning the lack of cooperation by the Syrian regime with the Commission of 

Inquiry, reiterating its decision to transmit the reports of the Commission of Inquiry  to 

the Security Council, expressing its appreciation to the Commission of Inquiry for its 

briefings to members of the Security Council, and requesting that the Commission of 

Inquiry continue to brief the General Assembly and members of the Security Council,  

 Reaffirming its condemnation in the strongest possible terms of the use of 

chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances, emphasizing that any use of 

chemical weapons anywhere, at any time, by anyone, under any circumstances is 

unacceptable and is and would be a violation of international law, and expressing its 

strong conviction that those individuals responsible for the use of chemical weapons 

must and should be held accountable,   

 Condemning in the strongest possible terms the fact that chemical weapons have 

been used repeatedly in the Syrian Arab Republic, including the instances 

independently attributed by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical 

Weapons, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations 

Joint Investigative Mechanism and the Investigation and Identification Team of the 

Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, noting that the Joint 

Investigative Mechanism concluded that the Syrian Arab Armed Forces had been 

responsible for attacks that released toxic substances in 2014 and 2015 and that ISIL 

(also known as Da’esh) had used sulfur mustard in 2015 and 2016, and further 

concluded in October 2017 that the Syrian Arab Air Force had been responsible for 

the use of chemical weapons on 4 April 2017 in Khan Shaykhun, and noting also that 

the Investigation and Identification Team concluded in April 2020 that there were 

reasonable grounds to believe that the Syrian Air Force had carried out three chemical 

weapons attacks in Ltamenah in March 2017 and further concluded in April  2021 that 

there were reasonable grounds to believe the Syrian Air Force had carried out a 

chemical weapons attack in Saraqib in February 2018,  



A/C.3/76/L.31/Rev.1 
 

 

21-16469 6/20 

 

 Noting that the work of the Investigation and Identification Team of the 

Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is ongoing, and that its report 

on the use of a toxic chemical as a weapon in Duma is forthcoming,  

 Welcoming the decision adopted on 9 July 2020 by the Executive Council of the 

Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, 34  in which the Executive 

Council condemned the use by the Syrian Arab Republic of chemical weapons in 

Ltamenah and requested that the Syrian Arab Republic take steps to redress the 

situation, welcoming also the decision adopted on 21 April 2021 by the Organisation 

for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Conference of the States Parties, 35 

addressing the possession and use of chemical weapons by the Syrian Arab Republic 

and suspending certain rights and privileges of the Syrian Arab Republic under the 

Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use 

of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction36 until the Director-General of the 

Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons reports that the Syrian Arab 

Republic has completed the measures requested by the Executive Council, and 

expressing regret that the Syrian Arab Republic has failed to comply with this request 

and demanding that the perpetrators immediately desist from any further use of 

chemical weapons, 

 Welcoming also the reports for 2019, 2020 and 2021 of the International, 

Impartial and Independent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation and Prosecution 

of Persons Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law 

Committed in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 201137 and their consideration 

by the General Assembly, noting with serious concern the observation of the 

Commission of Inquiry that, since March 2011, there are reasonable grounds to 

believe that the Syrian regime has conducted widespread and systemic attacks against 

the civilian population amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity, 

including targeted attacks on protected persons and objects, including medical 

facilities, and personnel and transport and blocked humanitarian convoys, as well as 

enforced disappearances, torture in detention, arbitrary detentions, summary 

executions and other violations and abuses, and underscoring the need for those 

allegations to be examined and evidence to be collected and made available for future 

accountability efforts, 

 Strongly condemning the reported killing of detainees in Syrian military 

intelligence facilities and the widespread practice of enforced disappearance, 

arbitrary detention and the use of sexual and gender-based violence and torture in 

detention centres referred to in the reports of the Commission of Inquiry, including, 

but not limited to, Branch 215, Branch 227, Branch 235, Branch 251, the Air Force 

Intelligence Investigation Branch at Mazzah military airport and Saydnaya prison, 

including the practice of mass hangings by the regime, as well as the killing of 

detainees at military hospitals, including Tishrin and Harasta hospitals,  

 Expressing grave concern about all persons missing as a result of the situation 

in the Syrian Arab Republic, including those subject to abductions, enforced 

disappearance and arbitrary detention, first and foremost by the Syrian regime, noting 

the comments of the Commission of Inquiry and the Special Envoy of the Secretary -

General for Syria that tens of thousands of individuals remain missing in th e Syrian 

Arab Republic, recalling Human Rights Council resolutions 45/3 of 6 October 202038

and 48/15 of 8 October 202139 and Security Council resolutions 2254 (2015), 2139 

(2014) and 2191 (2014) in this regard, and encouraging all parties to enhance 

engagement with the Office of the Special Envoy on the issue of arbitrary detention, 

as action to address enforced disappearance and arbitrary detention is intrinsically 

linked to protecting the rights of all Syrians and a lasting political sett lement in the 

Syrian Arab Republic, 

 Recalling the statements made by the Secretary-General, the United Nations 

High Commissioner for Human Rights and the special procedures of the Human 

Rights Council that crimes against humanity and war crimes are likely  to have been 

committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, noting the repeated encouragement by the 

High Commissioner for the Security Council to refer the situation to the International 

Criminal Court, and regretting that a draft resolution 40  was not adopted 

notwithstanding broad support from Member States,  

 Recalling also the report of 6 April 2020 of the United Nations Board of 

Inquiry41 into strikes that damaged and destroyed health-care facilities in the north-

west of the Syrian Arab Republic, including sites whose coordinates had been 

recorded on the United Nations deconfliction list as a step to ensure that they would 

not be targeted or impacted by violence, and which in most instances examined, 

concluded that it was “highly probable that the strikes had been carried out by the 

Government of the Syrian Arab Republic and/or its allies” and found that health -care 

services were being provided at the time of some of the strikes and that there were no 

armed opposition groups in or near the facilities, and calling on all parties to adhere 

to and comply with the deconfliction mechanism,  

 Recalling further the report of March 2021 of the Independent International 

Commission of Inquiry 42  reporting regime and pro-regime forces’ indiscriminate 

bombardment of civilian populated areas and deliberate targeting of hospitals and 

medical facilities, and areas with large civilian concentrations, including markets, 

schools and neighbourhoods, and concluding that government forces had committed 

war crimes and crimes against humanity in the conduct of their use of air strikes and 

artillery shelling of civilian areas.  

 Calling for the immediate repeal of Law No. 10/2018, concerned about the 

Syrian regime’s infringement on the housing, land and property of Syrians, 

particularly through the dispossession of displaced Syrians’ land and property in the 

national legislation and similar measures, which would have a significant detrimental 

impact on the rights of Syrians displaced by the conflict to claim their property and 

to return to their homes in a safe, voluntary and dignified manner when the situation 

on the ground allows it, and expressing concern about reports of armed groups’ abuses 

of Syrians’ housing, land and property rights in areas under their control,  

 Deploring in this regard the existence and application of national legislation, in 

particular Law No. 42/2018 and other legislation and practices concerning housing, 

land and property rights, which have a significant detrimental impact on the rights of 

Syrians displaced by the conflict to claim their property, as evidenced by continuing 

reports of widespread demolition of property in areas formerly controlled by the 

Syrian opposition as well as the confiscation of property owned by arbitrarily detained 

and missing persons throughout the Syrian Arab Republic, calling for the immediate 

repeal of that legislation, and stressing the right of everyone, including displaced 

Syrians, to not be arbitrarily deprived of their property and that they should be able 

to return to their homes in a safe, voluntary and dignified manner when the situation

on the ground allows it, noting in this regard the issuing in September by the Syrian 

Ministry of Justice of Circular No. 30 of 2021, which requires prior security approval 

in order to obtain judicial power of attorney, an order that risks further 

disenfranchisement of displaced people and refugees who rely on power of attorney 

to conduct civil administrative affairs,  

 Expressing concern that the implementation of Security Council resolutions 

2139 (2014), 2165 (2014), 2191 (2014), 2254 (2015), 2258 (2015), 2268 (2016),

2585 (2021) remains unresolved, and noting the urgent need to strengthen efforts to 

address the humanitarian situation in the Syrian Arab Republic, including through 

protection of civilians and safe, full, immediate, unimpeded and sustained 

humanitarian access throughout the Syrian Arab Republic,  

 Emphasizing that the humanitarian cross-border mechanism remains an 

essential and life-saving channel to address the humanitarian needs of a significant 

portion of the population of the Syrian Arab Republic, which cannot be reached 

through existing operations within the Syrian Arab Republic, and emphasizing the 

importance of cross-line operations and also that an immediate and significant 

improvement to cross-line access and respect for principled humanitarian action are 

essential to prevent further unnecessary suffering and loss of life,  

 Expressing grave concern at the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and about 

United Nations reports on rising numbers of death notices and burials which seem to 

indicate that actual COVID-19 cases in the Syrian Arab Republic far exceed official 

figures, recognizing that the pandemic presents a profound challenge to the decimated 

health system, socioeconomic and humanitarian situations of the Syrian Arab 

Republic, and the disproportionate impacts on women and girls, underlining that the 

grave risk posed by COVID-19 heightens the imperative of using every possible 

means, including the cross-border mechanism, to reach people in need without 

preconditions and discrimination, calling for the provision of humanitarian assistance 

to all parts of the Syrian Arab Republic, including in areas where humanitarian needs 

are especially urgent, and stressing the importance of accurate and timely data 

collection and reporting, 

 Recalling its commitment to Security Council resolutions 2170 (2014), 

2178 (2014) and 2253 (2015) of 17 December 2015, 

 Alarmed that more than 5.6 million refugees, including more than 3.8 million 

women and children, have been forced to flee the Syrian Arab Republic and that 

11.1 million people in the Syrian Arab Republic, of whom 6.6 million are internally 

displaced, require urgent humanitarian assistance, which has resulted in an influx of 

Syrian refugees into neighbouring countries, other countries in the region and beyond, 

and alarmed at the risk the situation presents to regional and international stability,  

 Expressing its profound indignation at the death of more than 29,000 children 

and the many more injured since the beginning of the peaceful protests in March 2011, 

and at all violations and abuses committed against children, in particular by the Syrian 

regime, in contravention of applicable international law, including those involving 

their recruitment and use, abduction, killing and maiming and rape and other forms 

of sexual and gender-based violence, attacks on schools and hospitals, and denial of 

humanitarian access, as well as their arbitrary arrest, detention, torture and ill -

treatment and their use as human shields, and noting in this regard the adoption on 

18 July 2019 of the Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict 

conclusions on children and armed conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic 43 as well as 

the report of 13 January 2020 of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry

entitled “They have erased the dreams of my children: children’s rights in the Syrian 

Arab Republic”, and emphasizing that the Syrian regime and its allies must comply 

with their applicable international law obligations that are relevant to children, 

including under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Protocols thereto,  

 Noting with concern that the Hawl camp currently hosts over 58,000 people, 

93 per cent of whom are women and children, including some 35,000 children under 

12 years of age who live under extremely challenging conditions,  

 Recalling with serious concern the findings of the Commission of Inquiry in its 

report entitled “Out of sight, out of mind: deaths in detention in the Syrian Arab 

Republic”, and its report to the Human Rights Council dated September 2021, 44 

noting in this regard the issuing of death notifications of detained individuals by the 

Syrian regime, which provides further indication of systematic violations of 

international human rights law and international humanitarian law, as well as the 

Commission’s reporting in March 2019 and 2021 on the scope and scale of arbitrary 

arrests and detention used by government forces as tools of repression that have led 

to the custodial deaths of tens of thousands of Syrian civilians and its reporting that 

the deaths of thousands of individuals previously detained in Hama, Ladhiqiyah, 

Hasakah and Damascus have been confirmed by Syrian regime entities through 

certificates of death, and the findings of the Commission in its report of March 2021 

entitled “Arbitrary Imprisonment and Detention”, noting that the whereabouts of tens 

of thousands of detainees remains unknown and unacknowledged by the Syrian 

regime, recalling chilling accounts of detention, killings, disappearances, torture and 

inhumane conditions, which the Commission meticulously documented and described 

as amounting to crimes against humanity, of extermination, murder, rape or other 

forms of sexual and gender-based violence, torture and imprisonment in the context 

of the regime’s widespread and systematic detentions, and immediately calling for the 

cessation of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 

and sexual and gender-based violence, in places of detention, and the cessation of all 

forms of incommunicado detention, for the release of all persons arbitrarily detained, 

for all feasible measures to be taken, under Security Council resolution 2474 (2019) 

of 11 June 2019, to search for and reveal the fates of those detained and/or 

disappeared, and for the further establishment of an effective channel of 

communication with families to ensure that their legal, economic and psychological 

needs are addressed adequately, as set out in its latest report, 45 

 Urging the Syrian regime to provide families with the remains of their r elatives 

whose fate has been disclosed, including those who have been summarily executed, 

to take all appropriate measures immediately to protect the lives and rights of all 

persons currently detained or unaccounted for, and to clarify the fate of those wh o 

remain missing or are still in custody in accordance with Security Council resolution 

2474 (2019), many of whom still remain in detention and are highly vulnerable to 

COVID-19 owing to overcrowded conditions and pre-existing health issues, such as 

widespread malnutrition and tuberculosis, despite calls from the Secretary -General, 

the Special Envoy and the international community for the large-scale release of 

detainees in the Syrian Arab Republic to mitigate the spread of the virus,  

 Welcoming Security Council resolution 2475 (2019) of 20 June 2019 on the 

situation of persons with disabilities in armed conflict, expressing serious concern 

regarding the disproportionate impact that armed conflict has on persons with 

disabilities, including abandonment, violence and lack of access to basic services, 

stressing the protection and assistance needs of all affected civilian populations, and

 Expressing its deep appreciation for the significant efforts that have been made 

by neighbouring countries and other countries in the region to accommodate Syrians, 

while acknowledging the increasing financial, socioeconomic and political impact of 

the presence of large-scale refugee and displaced populations in those countries,  

 Welcoming the efforts of the United Nations and the League of Arab States and 

all diplomatic efforts to achieve a political solution to the Syrian crisis based on the 

final communiqué of the Action Group for Syria of 30 June 2012 and consistent with 

Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), 

 Expressing full support for the efforts of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-

General for Syria, with a view to the protection of the civilian population and the full 

implementation of the Syrian political process that establishes credible, inclusive and 

non-sectarian governance in accordance with the final communiqué and consistent 

with Security Council resolutions 2254 (2015) and 2258 (2015), urging Syrian parties 

to engage constructively with the Constitutional Committee in order to pave the way 

for the negotiation of a genuine political transition, noting with appreciation the 

mediation efforts to facilitate the establishment of a ceasefire in the Syrian Arab 

Republic, as noted by the Security Council in its resolution 2336 (2016), and 

supporting the efforts to end violence, while expressing deep concern at the 

violations, demanding that all parties to the ceasefire in the Syrian Arab Republic 

respect their commitments, and urging all Member States, especially the members of 

the International Syria Support Group, to use their influence to ensure respect for 

those commitments and the full implementation of those resolutions, to support 

efforts to create conditions for a durable and lasting ceasefire, which is essential to 

achieving a political solution to the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, and to bring 

to an end the systematic, widespread and gross violations and abuses of human rights 

and violations of international humanitarian law,  

 1. Strongly condemns the systematic, widespread and gross violations and 

abuses of international human rights law and violations of international humanitarian 

law committed in the Syrian Arab Republic and the indiscriminate and 

disproportionate attacks against the civilian population and against civilian 

infrastructure, in particular attacks on medical facilities and schools, which  continue 

to claim civilian lives, and demands that all parties comply with their obligations 

under international humanitarian law;  

 2. Deplores and condemns in the strongest terms  the continued armed 

violence by the Syrian regime against the Syrian people since the beginning of the 

peaceful protests in 2011, and demands that the Syrian regime immediately put an 

end to all attacks against civilians, take all feasible precautions to avoid, and in any 

event to minimize, incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to 

civilian objects and meet its responsibilities to protect the Syrian population and

Support Group, to create conditions for continued negotiations  for a political solution 

to the Syrian conflict, under the auspices of the United Nations, by working towards 

the nationwide ceasefire, to enable safe, full, immediate, unimpeded and sustained 

humanitarian access and to lead to the release of those arbitrarily detained and ensure 

the assessment of the number of people who remain in prisons, consistent with 

Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), as only a durable and inclusive political 

solution to the conflict can bring an end to the systematic, widespread and gross

humanitarian law; 

 4. Strongly condemns any use of chemical weapons, such as chlorine, sarin 

and sulfur mustard, by any party to the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, emphasizes  

that the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer or use 

of chemical weapons anywhere, at any time, by anyone, under any circumstances, is 

unacceptable, constitutes one of the most serious crimes under international law, and 

is a violation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production,

responsible for the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention,

expeditiously to be shared with the International, Impartial and Independent 

Mechanism without any further delays;  

 8. Demands that the Syrian regime adhere fully to its international 

obligations, including the requirement that it declare in full its chemical weapons 

programme, with special emphasis on the need for the Syrian Arab Republic to 

urgently resolve the verified gaps, inconsistencies and discrepancies pertaining to its 

declaration in respect of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, 

Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction and 

to eliminate its chemical weapons programme in its entirety; 46  

 9. Requests that the Executive Council of the Organisation for the Prohibition 

of Chemical Weapons consider additional procedures for stringent verification

violations of international humanitarian law, and reaffirms that terrorism cannot and 

should not be associated with any religion, gender, ethnicity, nationality or civilization ; 

 14. Condemns in the strongest terms the gross and systematic abuse of women’s 

and children’s rights by terrorist groups and armed groups, including so-called ISIL (also 

known as Da’esh), in particular those involving the killing of women and girls, sexual 

and gender-based violence, including the enslavement and sexual exploitation and abuse 

of women and girls and the recruitment, use and abduction of children;  

 15. Condemns the reported forced displacements of the population in the 

Syrian Arab Republic, including forced displacement of civilians as a result of local 

truce agreements, as highlighted by the Commission of Inquiry, and the alarming 

impact thereof on the demography of the country, which amounts to a strategy of 

radical demographic change initiated by the Syrian regime, its allies and other 

non-State actors, calls upon all parties concerned to cease immediately all activities 

related to these actions, including any activities that may amount to war crimes and

 18. Reminds the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic of its obligations 

under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading

Convention, including with respect to the obligation to extradite or prosecute 

contained in article 7 of the Convention;  

 19. Encourages the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally 

displaced persons and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for

internally displaced persons in the Syrian Arab Republic, with a view to helping 

Member States, the United Nations, including the High-level Panel on Internal 

Displacement established by the Secretary-General, and other humanitarian and 

human rights actors to improve their responses to internal displacement in the Syrian 

Arab Republic, with a focus on identifying durable solutions for displ aced persons,

and providing more effective assistance through well-planned programmes; 

 20. Deplores the continued closure of the Bab al-Salam and Ya‘rubiyah border 

crossings for the purpose of cross-border humanitarian aid, and urges the Security 

Council to reauthorize the use of these border crossings and to continue to consider 

additional crossing points to meet humanitarian needs, considering that humanitarian 

needs have risen 38 per cent in north-east Syrian Arab Republic since the closing of 

the Ya‘rubiyah border crossing alone, according to the United Nations, emphasizes 

that more than 6.9 million people live in areas not under the control of the Syrian 

regime and 5.3 million require humanitarian assistance in the north -east and north-

west, and also considers the multiplier effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and that the 

cross-border mechanism remains an indispensable tool to address the humanitarian 

needs of the population, including to deliver vaccines and supplies to combat the 

COVID-19 pandemic, which cannot be adequately reached through existing 

operations within the Syrian Arab Republic, in the light of the limitations of cross-

line assistance; 

 21. Demands that the Syrian regime and all other parties to the conflict not 

hinder safe, full, timely, immediate, unrestricted and sustained humanitarian access, 

and calls for the continuation of cross-border humanitarian support beyond July 2022;

law and abuses of human rights, in this regard expresses deep concern at the 

prevailing climate of impunity for sexual and gender-based violence, urges all parties 

to the conflict, especially the Syrian regime, to immediately cease the perpetration of

sexual and gender-based violence, and urges the Syrian regime to ensure that victims 

and survivors of sexual and gender-based violence have access to holistic support and 

are able to seek reparations and redress; 

 23. Also strongly condemns all violations and abuses committed against 

children in contravention of applicable international law, including those involving 

their recruitment and use, killing and maiming, rape and all other forms of sexual and 

gender-based violence, abductions, denial of humanitarian access and education for 

children, and attacks on civilian objects, including schools and hospitals, as well as 

their arbitrary arrest, unlawful detention, torture and ill-treatment and their use as 

human shields; 

 24. Expresses grave concern at the deprivation of liberty of children for their 

association or alleged association with armed groups or armed forces, and urges the 

Syrian regime to comply with its obligations under the Convention on the Right s of 

the Child, as applicable, in particular that the arrest, detention and imprisonment of 

children should be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest 

appropriate period of time, and that in actions concerning children the best interests  

of the child should be a primary consideration;  

 25. Reaffirms the Syrian regime’s responsibility for the systematic use of 

enforced disappearances, takes note of the assessment of the Commission of Inquiry 

that the Syrian regime’s use of enforced disappearances amounts to a crime against 

humanity, and condemns the targeted disappearances of young men and boys and the 

exploitation of ceasefires as an opportunity to forcibly recruit and arbitrarily detain 

them; 

 26. Notes with deep concern the March 2021 report of the Commission of 

Inquiry and its comments that widespread enforced disappearance has been 

deliberately perpetrated by all parties to the conflict and first and foremost the Syrian 

regime security forces throughout the past decade on a massive scale; 

 27. Expresses deep concern that, according to the recent findings of the 

Commission of Inquiry, the Syrian regime forces continue to deliberately conceal the 

fate and whereabouts of forcibly disappeared persons, intentionally prolonging the 

suffering of hundreds of thousands of family members of the forcibly disappeared, 

which is gravely concerning as evidence suggests that the Syrian regime maintains a 

detailed bureaucracy and high degree of centralized control with regard to those it has 

detained, including records on who is detained and where, noting the potential value 

of such information to family members of those who are missing, including those 

forcibly disappeared, and calls upon the Syrian regime to provide information on 

detained, missing or forcibly disappeared persons to their families;  

 28. Encourages all parties to the conflict to enhance their engagement with 

the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Syria to hasten the release of all 

arbitrarily detained persons by the Syrian regime and to make progress on the issue 

of missing persons; 

 29. Demands that the Syrian regime, consistent with its obligations under 

relevant provisions of international human rights law and international humanitarian 

law, promote non-discriminatory access to health services and respect and protect the 

wounded and sick as well as medical and health personnel from obstruction, threats 

and physical attacks, and notes with concern the limited access to health-care services 

in the light of COVID-19, particularly in the north of the Syrian Arab Republic, where 

health-care networks have been severely damaged and in many cases destroyed by 

the regime and its allies’ aerial attacks;  

 30. Strongly condemns all attacks on the wounded and sick as well as medical 

and health personnel, their means of transport and equipment, as well as on hospitals 



 
A/C.3/76/L.31/Rev.1 

 

15/20 21-16469 

 

and other medical facilities, deplores the long-term consequences of such attacks for 

the population and health-care systems of the Syrian Arab Republic, and reaffirms the 

obligations under international humanitarian law related to the protection of medical 

personnel and humanitarian personnel, their means of transport and equipment;  

 31. Also strongly condemns the targeting of humanitarian workers and persons 

engaged in medical duties, their means of transport and equipment and hospitals and 

other medical facilities, which may constitute war crimes, including the attack against 

the deconflicted Atarib cave hospital on 21 March 2021 and the terrorist attack against 

Al-Shifa’ hospital on 12 June 2021; 

 32. Urges all parties to the conflict to develop effective measures to prevent 

acts of violence, attacks and threats of attacks against sick and wounded persons, 

internally displaced persons, as well as medical personnel and humanitarian 

personnel, hospitals and other medical facilities, including through the conduct of 

full, prompt, impartial and effective investigations to hold those responsible for any 

such acts to account; 

 33. Expresses its profound concern about the findings contained in the report 

of July 2020 of the Commission of Inquiry regarding at least 1,500 air strikes, 

predominantly air-to-ground missiles and barrel bombs launched in south-eastern 

Idlib and western Aleppo between 1 November 2019 and 5 March 2020, which 

damaged medical facilities, schools and markets and killed civilians, and the 

conclusions of the Commission of Inquiry that there exist “reasonable grounds to 

believe that pro-government forces committed the war crimes of deliberately 

attacking medical personnel and facilities by conducting air strikes”, as well as “the 

war crime of launching indiscriminate attacks resulting in death or injury to 

civilians”, causing the displacement of over 560,000 people from the north -west of 

Idlib, in addition to the previous displacement of more than half of the 2.5 million 

people residing in Idlib who have been displaced since the onset of conflict, often 

multiple times, stresses that the situation in Idlib is of particular concern, expresses 

its support for the current agreement to cease hostilities in order to avoid a further 

humanitarian catastrophe, and calls upon the guarantors of that agreement to ensure 

that the ceasefire is upheld and that humanitarian access is granted in a safe, full, 

rapid, unimpeded and sustainable manner; 

 34. Demands that the Syrian regime cooperate fully with the Commission of 

Inquiry, including by granting it immediate, full, safe, unhindered and sustained 

access throughout the Syrian Arab Republic;  

 35. Strongly condemns the intervention in the Syrian Arab Republic of all 

foreign terrorist fighters and those foreign organizations and foreign forces fighting 

on behalf of the Syrian regime, expresses deep concern that their involvement further 

exacerbates the deteriorating situation in the Syrian Arab Republic, including the 

human rights and humanitarian situation, which has a serious negative impact on the 

region, and further demands that all foreign terrorist fighters, and those who are 

fighting in support of the Syrian regime, including all milit ias sponsored by foreign 

Governments, must immediately withdraw from the Syrian Arab Republic;  

 36. Demands that all parties immediately put an end to all violations of 

international human rights law, abuses of human rights and violations of international 

humanitarian law, recalls, in particular, the obligation under international 

humanitarian law to distinguish between civilians and combatants and the prohibition 

against indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks and all attacks against civilians 

and civilian objects, further demands that all parties to the conflict take all appropriate 

steps to protect civilians, in compliance with international law, including by desisting 

from attacks directed against civilian objects, such as medical centres, schools an d 

water stations, and refrain from militarizing such facilities, seek to avoid establishing

areas, and recalls in this regard that the Syrian regime bears primary responsibility 

for protecting its population; 

 37. Condemns in the strongest terms all attacks on protected objects, including 

indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks and those which may constitute a war 

crime, taking place in the Syrian Arab Republic, requests the Commission of Inquiry 

to continue to investigate all such acts, and demands that the Syrian regime meet its 

responsibility to protect the Syrian population;  

 38. Demands that the Syrian regime immediately cease any attacks on 

civilians, any disproportionate attacks and any indiscriminate use of weapons in 

populated areas, and recalls in this regard the obligation to respect international 

humanitarian law in all circumstances;  

 39. Emphasizes the need for accountability for crimes involving breaches of 

international law, in particular of international humanitarian law and human rights 

law, some of which may constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity, committed 

in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011, through fair and independent 

investigations and prosecutions at the domestic or international level;  

 40. Requests the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism to 

submit an annual report to the General Assembly, starting at its seventy-fifth session, 

on the implementation of its mandate while preserving the confidential nature of its 

substantive work, in time for the annual presentation of the report by the Head of the 

Mechanism in April at a plenary meeting of the Assembly under the agenda item 

entitled “Prevention of armed conflict”;  

 41. Welcomes efforts by the International, Impartial and Independent 

Mechanism to assist in the search for missing persons in the Syrian context, as stated 

in the Mechanism’s reports to the General Assembly, and further encourages the 

Mechanism to identify additional ways and means to contribute to this end;  

 42. Also welcomes the inclusion of the full funding for the International, 

Impartial and Independent Mechanism in the budget proposal of the Secretary -

General for 2020, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 73/182, and

goal, and for that reason encourages the Security Council to take appropriate action 

to ensure accountability, noting the important role that the International Criminal 

Court can play in this regard in accordance with complementarity;  

 44. Welcomes the efforts by States to investigate conduct in the Syrian Arab 

Republic and to prosecute crimes within their jurisdiction committed in the Syrian 

Arab Republic, encourages them to continue to do so and to share relevant 

information between States in accordance with their national legislation and 

international law, and also encourages other States to consider doing the same;  

 45. Urgently requests the Commission of Inquiry to present its latest reporting 

to the General Assembly during an interactive dialogue at its seventy-seventh session 

on the situation of human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic, and encourages United 

Nations monitoring and reporting to further document violations of internati onal

provide humanitarian and medical assistance to the millions of Syrians who are in 

need, including those displaced both internally and in host countries and communities;  

 48. Welcomes the efforts of those countries outside the region that have put in 

place measures and policies to assist and host Syrian refugees, encourages them to do 

more, also encourages other States outside the region to consider implementing similar 

measures and policies, with a view to providing Syrian refugees with protection and 

humanitarian assistance, acknowledges the need to improve the conditions on the 

ground to facilitate the return of refugees in a safe, voluntary, informed and dignified 

manner to their place of origin or another location of their choice, and takes note of 

the recent finding of the Commission of Inquiry that the Syrian Arab Republic does 

not yet offer a safe and stable environment for the sustainable and dignified return of 

refugees or for the 6.7 million displaced persons inside the country;  

 49. Strongly condemns the intentional denial of humanitarian assistance to 

civilians, from whatever quarter, and in particular the denial of medical assistance 

and the withdrawal of water and sanitation services to civilian areas, which has

prohibited under international law, and noting especially the primary responsibility 

of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic in this regard; 

 50. Demands that the Syrian regime and all other parties to the conflict ensure 

the full, immediate, unimpeded and sustained safe and unhindered access of the

areas such as Rukban, that the Syrian regime cease to impede the ability of the United 

Nations and humanitarian actors to move through the north-east of the Syrian Arab 

Republic and beyond, especially in the light of the restricted humanitarian spa ce and 

worsened humanitarian situation following the failure to reauthorize the Ya‘rubiyah 

border crossing in Security Council resolutions 2504 (2020), 2533 (2020) and 2585 

(2021) and that all parties preserve the Fish Khabur border crossing and other crossing 

points along the Turkish borders with the Syrian Arab Republic, and allow sustained 

deliveries of humanitarian assistance to persons in need across the Syrian Arab 

Republic, including through commercial routes, consistent with Security Council 

resolutions 2139 (2014), 2165 (2014), 2191 (2014), 2254 (2015), 2258 (2015),

may amount to crimes against humanity;  

 52. Deplores the suffering and torture in detention centres throughout the 

Syrian Arab Republic, as depicted in the reports of the Commission of Inquiry and 

the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as well as in 

the evidence presented by “Caesar” in January 2014, and in the reports of widespread 

killing of detainees by Syrian military intelligence;  

 53. Strongly condemns the reported killing of detainees in Syrian military 

intelligence facilities, and calls upon the Syrian regime to release all unlawfully held 

detainees, including women, children and the elderly, and to facilitate information 

about those still in detention as well as those who died while in detention by the 

Syrian regime, returning their remains, with full transparency regarding what 

happened to these individuals, and urges the regime to immediately reverse its 

abhorrent use of mass detentions and torture as means of silencing and repressing 

political opposition, journalists and other media workers and of depriving Syrian 

citizens of their rights to freedom of expression;  

 54. Calls for the appropriate international monitoring bodies to be granted 

access to detainees in all prisons and detention centres, including all military facilities 

referred to in the reports of the Commission of Inquiry; 

 55. Demands in this respect the immediate release of all persons arbitrarily or 

unlawfully detained by the Syrian regime, notes in particular the additional life -

threatening risks to health created by the COVID-19 pandemic and the high risks that 

exacerbate the already dire situation of detainees, and notes in this regard the 

statements made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the 

Special Envoy and the Commission of Inquiry;  

 56. Also demands that all parties take all appropriate steps to protect civilians

looting and trafficking of Syrian cultural property, as outlined by the Security Council 

in its resolutions 2199 (2015) of 12 February 2015 and 2347 (2017) of 24 March 2017, 

affirms that attacks intentionally directed against historic monuments may amount to 

war crimes, and underlines the need to bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice;

surrounding areas in December 2019 and caused large-scale injuries, deaths, 

displacement and suffering in the civilian population and devastating damage to 

civilian infrastructure, recalls the findings of the United Nations Board of Inquiry 

established by the Secretary-General in this regard, notes with grave concern the 

recent findings of the Commission of Inquiry that there are reasonable grounds to 

believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed during the said

military offensive, and remains extremely concerned about the situation;  

 59. Notes with concern the continued insecurity in the north-east of the Syrian

humanitarian space following the failure to reauthorize the Ya‘rubiyah border 

crossing, in Security Council resolutions 2504 (2020), 2533 (2020) and 2585 (2021), 

further compounded by lack of access to water and electricity, which continues to 

undermine the stability and security of the whole region, eroding progress in the fight

humanitarian actors’ ability to respond to humanitarian needs;  

 60. Stresses the situation of particular concern in north-west Syrian Arab 

Republic, particularly Idlib, strongly condemns the attacks on civilians and first 

responders and civilian infrastructure where ongoing violence, including air strikes, 

continues to cause death and injury among civilians and first responders, as well as 

devastating damage to civilian infrastructure, including health-care and educational 

facilities, and welcomes the establishment of the United Nations board of inquiry

Nations deconfliction list and United Nations-supported facilities; 

 61. Expresses concern about reports of attacks on civilians in areas such as 

Daraa that supported peaceful protests in 2011, and the siege-like conditions in Daraa 

that have displaced 40,000 people and resulted in acute food and medicine shortages, 

and, targeted assassinations of civilian leaders including former judges, medical 

workers and others engaged in reconciliation negotiations, noting that the Chair of 

the Commission of Inquiry reported in June 2021 that at least 130 such incidents had 

been recorded between July 2020 and April 2021, underscoring the pervasively 

unstable environment;

in the north-west, including air strikes, and the impact on civilians of that violence, 

including the reported deaths and injuries of at least 45 children since the beginning 

of July 2021, stresses the urgent need for the immediate cessation of military 

hostilities in Idlib and the surrounding areas, for the prioritization of the protection 

of all civilians, including those displaced, and for full, timely, immediate, unrestricted 

and safe humanitarian access, including cross-border access, recalls the Additional 

Protocol to the Memorandum on the Stabilization of the Situation in the Idlib 

De-escalation Area, signed by the Russian Federation and Turkey on 5 March 2020, 

and stresses the importance of continuing work towards preserving calm on the 

ground and creating the necessary conditions for the safe, dignified and voluntary 

returns of displaced people; 

 63. Notes the recommendation of the Commission of Inquiry that an 

independent mechanism be created with an international mandate to coordinate and 

consolidate claims regarding missing persons, including persons subjected  to 

enforced disappearance, the briefing of the Secretary-General to the General 

Assembly on 30 March 2021 in which he noted the lack of progress on those issues 

in the absence of an international mandate, and the endorsement of an independent 

mechanism by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on 

24 September 2021, and reiterates the importance of not tampering with or 

contaminating mass grave sites in the Syrian Arab Republic in this regard;  

 64.  Requests the Secretary-General to conduct a study on how to bolster 

efforts, including through existing measures and mechanisms, to clarify the fate and 

whereabouts of missing people in the Syrian Arab Republic, identify human remains 

and provide support to their families, in consultation with the Office of the  United 

Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and based on the recommendations of 

the Commission of Inquiry, with the full and meaningful participation of victims, 

survivors and their families and in consultation with other relevant actors, and to

 65.  Calls on all Member States, relevant United Nations bodies, international 

organizations and civil society to coordinate further efforts and proactively focus 

attention on the issue of missing persons in the Syrian Arab Republic, including those 

subjected to enforced disappearance, and recalls the importance of the full and 

meaningful participation of victims, survivors and their families in such efforts;  



A/C.3/76/L.31/Rev.1 
 

 

21-16469 20/20 

 

 66. Urges all parties to the conflict to take all appropriate steps to ensure the 

safety and security of United Nations and associated personnel, personnel of the 

specialized agencies and all other personnel engaged in humanitarian relief activities, 

including national and locally recruited personnel, as required by international 

humanitarian law, without prejudice to their freedom of movement and access, stresses 

the need not to impede or hinder these efforts, recalls that attacks on humanitarian 

workers may amount to war crimes, and notes in this regard that the Security Council 

has reaffirmed that it will take further measures in the event of non-compliance with 

its resolutions 2139 (2014), 2165 (2014), 2191 (2014), 2234 (2015), 2258 (2015), 

2286 (2016), 2393 (2017), 2401 (2018), 2449 (2018) and 2585 (2021) by any Syrian 

party;

resolution 1325 (2000) and all subsequent resolutions of the women, peace and 

security agenda; 

 68. Reaffirms that there can only be a political solution to the conflict in the 

Syrian Arab Republic, reiterates its commitment to the national unity and territorial 

integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic, and urges the parties to the conflict to abstain 

from actions that may contribute to the continuing deterioration of the human rights, 

security and humanitarian situation, in order to reach a genuine political transition, 

based on the final communiqué of the Action Group for Syria of 30 June 2012, 

consistent with Security Council resolutions 2254 (2015), 2268 (2016) and 2585 

(2021), that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people for a civil, 

democratic and pluralistic State, with the full, equal and meaningful participation and 

leadership of all women at all levels, where there is no room for sectarianism or 

discrimination on ethnic, religious, linguistic, gender or any other grounds, and where 

all persons receive equal protection, regardless of gender, religion or ethnicity, and 

further demands that all parties work urgently towards the comprehensive 

implementation of the final communiqué, including through the establishment of an 

inclusive transitional governing body with full executive powers, which shall be 

formed on the basis of mutual consent while ensuring the continuity of governmental 

institutions.
