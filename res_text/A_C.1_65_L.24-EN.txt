 Stressing the importance of the treaties of Tlatelolco,3 Rarotonga,4 Bangkok5 
and Pelindaba6 establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones, as well as the Antarctic 
Treaty,7 to, inter alia, achieve a world entirely free of nuclear weapons, 

 Welcoming the second Conference of States Parties and Signatories to Treaties that 
Establish Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones and Mongolia, held in New York on 30 April 
2010, and noting that 115 States are currently parties and signatories to these treaties, 

 Underlining the value of enhancing cooperation among the nuclear-weapon-
free-zone treaty members by means of mechanisms such as joint meetings of States 
parties, signatories and observers to those treaties,  

 Reaffirming the applicable principles and rules of international law relating to 
the freedom of the high seas and the rights of passage through maritime space, 
including those of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,8 

 1. Welcomes the continued contribution that the Antarctic Treaty7 and the 
treaties of Tlatelolco,3 Rarotonga,4 Bangkok5 and Pelindaba6 are making towards 
freeing the southern hemisphere and adjacent areas covered by those treaties from 
nuclear weapons; 

 2. Notes with satisfaction that all nuclear-weapon-free zones in the southern 
hemisphere and adjacent areas are now in force; 

 3. Notes that the Russian Federation has initiated internal procedures to 
ratify the appropriate protocols to the Treaty of Pelindaba and also notes the positive 
announcement of the United States of America of its intention to begin the process 
of ratification of the protocols to the treaties of Pelindaba and Rarotonga; 

 4. Calls upon all States concerned to continue to work together in order to 
facilitate adherence to the protocols to nuclear-weapon-free-zone treaties by all 
relevant States that have not yet done so and, in this regard, notes the positive 
announcement of the United States of America to conduct consultations with the 
parties to the nuclear-weapon-free zones in Central and South-East Asia in an effort 
to sign and ratify the relevant protocols; 

 5. Welcomes the steps taken to conclude further nuclear-weapon-free-zone 
treaties on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region 
concerned, and calls upon all States to consider all relevant proposals, including 
those reflected in its resolutions on the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones 
in the Middle East and South Asia; 

 6. Affirms its conviction of the important role of nuclear-weapon-free zones 
in strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime and in extending the areas of 
the world that are nuclear-weapon-free, and, with particular reference to the 
responsibilities of the nuclear-weapon States, calls upon all States to support the 
process of nuclear disarmament and to work for the total elimination of all nuclear 
weapons;
