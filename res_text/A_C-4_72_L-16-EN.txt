 and 

other relevant information,  

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory

people of Guam and in conformity with the clearly defined principles contained in 

General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of

colonialism by 2020 and the plans of action for the Second
4
 and Third International 

Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism,  

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people 

of Guam require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the options for 

self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical location, 

size of population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the 

Non-Self-Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the 

use of the Territories as tax havens to the detriment of the world economy and by 

the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that are 

contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 1514 

(XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the 

Territory, under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case -by-case basis, and that 

the views of the people of Guam in respect of their right  to self-determination 

should be ascertained,  

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the 

local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional 

organizations,  

 Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding 

of the political status of the people of Guam and to fulfil its mandate effectively, it 

is important for it to be apprised by the United States of America as the 

administering Power and to receive information from other appropriate sources, 

including the representatives of the Territory, concerning the wishes and aspirations 

of the people of the Territory,  

 Aware of the importance both to Guam and to the Special Committee of the 

participation of elected and appointed representatives of Guam in the work of the 

Committee,  

 Recognizing the need for the Special Committee to ensure that the appropriate 

bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at 

assisting the people of Guam with their inalienable right to self-determination and 

in gaining a better understanding of the options for self-determination, on a case-by-

case basis,  

 Mindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the 

Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 

representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 

the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the 

seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial 

element in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political 

status of the Territories,  

 Welcoming the Caribbean regional seminar on the theme “Implementation of 

the Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism: the future for 

decolonization in the Non-Self-Governing Territories: what are the prospects?”, held

by the Special Committee in Kingstown and hosted by the Government of Saint 

Vincent and the Grenadines from 16 to 18 May 2017, as a significant and forward-

looking event, which enabled the participants to assess progress made and address 

challenges faced in the decolonization process, review the existing working methods 

of the Committee and renew its commitment to implementing it s historic task,  

 Recognizing the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted 

by the seminar, which are annexed to the report of the Special Committee
5
 and 

which outline the findings of the seminar, including, especially, the way forward for  

the decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General 

Assembly of the period 2011-2020 as the Third International Decade for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,
6
 

 Noting with appreciation the contribution to the development of some 

Territories by the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations 

system, in particular the Economic Commission for Latin America and the 

Caribbean, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the 

United Nations Development Programme and the World Food Programme, as well 

as regional institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean 

Community, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, the Pacific Islands 

Forum and the agencies of the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific,  

 Noting the statement made by a representative of the Governor of Guam at the 

2017 Caribbean regional seminar, at which participants received updates on the 

financial and non-financial challenges faced by the Territory and the efforts towards 

decolonization, including endeavours made by the Guam Commission on 

Decolonization for the Implementation and Exercise of Chamorro Self-Determination 

through the education campaign to help the native inhabitants better understand the 

decolonization process, the plebiscite on self-determination and the political status 

options to be voted on,  

 Cognizant of the efforts made by the Guam Commission on Decolonization to 

promote in the Territory the holding of a plebiscite on self-determination, to 

populate the decolonization registry and to move forward with its education 

campaign, and noting that more than 11,000 native inhabitants have been registered 

to vote, a significant increase since 2000,  

 Noting with concern a ruling by a federal court of the United States, as the 

administering Power, in March 2017, that a plebiscite on self-determination could 

not be limited to native inhabitants, which has brought the plebiscite to a halt,  

 Noting, in this regard, the request by a representative of the Governor of Guam 

at the 2017 Caribbean regional seminar that the Special Committee urge the 

administering Power to assume its responsibility in allowing the people of Guam to 

fully exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and help Guam to develop 

ideas on how to overcome the current challenges hindering its ability to reach 

self-governance,  

 Recalling that the administering Power has approved a grant to support the 

self-determination education campaign in the Territory,  

 Recalling also that, in a referendum held in 1987, the registered and eligible 

voters of Guam endorsed a draft Guam Commonwealth Act that would establish a 

new framework for relations between the Territory and the administering Power, 

providing for a greater measure of internal self-government for Guam and

recognition of the right of the Chamorro people of Guam to self -determination for 

the Territory,  

 Aware that negotiations between the administering Power and the territorial 

Government on the draft Guam Commonwealth Act ended in 1997 and that Guam 

has subsequently established a non-binding plebiscite process for a self-

determination vote by the eligible Chamorro voters,  

 Cognizant of the importance of the administering Power continuing to 

implement its programme of transferring surplus federal land to the Government of 

Guam,  

 Noting a call for reform in the programme of the administering Power with 

respect to the thorough, unconditional and expeditious transfer of land property to 

the people of Guam,  

 Noting also the concerns expressed by a representative of the Governor of 

Guam at the 2017 Caribbean regional seminar regarding a potential lawsuit by the 

administering Power over the Chamorro Land Trust programme, which had been put 

in place to facilitate the transfer of land to the original landowners,  

 Noting further the expressed desire of the territorial Government for a visiting 

mission by the Special Committee,  

 Aware of the existing concerns of the Territory regarding the potential social, 

cultural, economic and environmental impacts of the planned transfer of additional 

military personnel of the administering Power to the Territory,  

 Aware also of the concerns expressed by the Territory on this subject before 

the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) at the 

seventy-second session of the General Assembly,  

 Recalling the statement made by the Speaker of the thirty-third Guam 

legislature before the Fourth Committee at the seventieth session of the General 

Assembly that the most acute threat to the legitimate exercise of the decolonization 

of Guam was the incessant militarization of the island by its administering Power, 

and noting the concern expressed regarding the effect of the escalating military 

activities and installations of the administering Power on Guam,  

 Recalling also its resolution 57/140 of 11 December 2002, in which it 

reiterated that military activities and arrangements by administering Powers in the 

Non-Self-Governing Territories under their administration should not run counter to 

the rights and interests of the peoples of the Territories concerned, especially their 

right to self-determination, including independence, and called upon the 

administering Powers concerned to terminate such activities and to eliminate t he 

remaining military bases in compliance with the relevant resolutions of the General 

Assembly,  

 Noting the concerns raised by the Territory before the Fourth Committee at the 

seventy-second session of the General Assembly about the involuntary placement  of 

the Territory in the midst of regional tensions,
