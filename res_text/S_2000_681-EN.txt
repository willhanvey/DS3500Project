Draft resolution

The Security Council,

Recalling all its earlier relevant resolutions, in particular its resolutions 779
(1992) of 6 October 1992, 981 (1995) of 31 March 1995, 1147 (1998) of 13 January
1998, 1183 (1998) of 15 July 1998, 1222 (1999) of 15 January 1999, 1252 (1999) of
15 July 1999 and 1285 (2000) of 13 January 2000,

Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 3 July 2000
(S/2000/647) on the United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP),

Recalling also the letter to its President from the Chargé d’affaires a.i. of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia of 16 June 2000 (S/2000/602) and the letter to the
Secretary-General from the Permanent Representative of Croatia of 5 April 2000
(S/2000/289), concerning the disputed issue of Prevlaka,

Reaffirming once again its commitment to independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia within its internationally recognized
borders,

Noting once again the Joint Declaration signed at Geneva on 30 September
1992 by the Presidents of the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, in particular articles 1 and 3, the latter reaffirming their agreement
concerning the demilitarization of the Prevlaka peninsula,

Noting with satisfaction that the overall situation in the UNMOP area of
responsibility has remained stable and calm,

Reiterating its concern about continuing violations of the demilitarization
regime, including limitations placed on the free movement of United Nations
military observers,

Noting with satisfaction that the opening of crossing points between Croatia
and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Montenegro) in the demilitarized zone
continue to facilitate civilian and commercial traffic in both directions without
security incidents and continue to represent a significant confidence-building
measure in the normalization of relations between the two parties, and urging the
parties to utilize these openings as a basis for further confidence-building measures
to achieve the normalization of relations between them,

Reiterating its serious concerns about the lack of substantive progress towards
a settlement of the disputed issue of Prevlaka in the continuing bilateral negotiations

S/2000/681

between the parties pursuant to the Agreement on Normalization of Relations
between the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia of 23
August 1996 (S/1996/706, annex), noting positive developments in this regard, and
calling for the resumption of discussions,

Expressing its concern over the delay in putting in place a comprehensive
demining programme by the parties,

Commending the role played by UNMOP, and noting also that the presence of
the United Nations military observers continues to be essential to maintaining
conditions that are conducive to a negotiated settlement of the disputed issue of
Prevlaka,

Recalling the relevant principles contained in the Convention on the Safety of
United Nations and Associated Personnel adopted on 9 December 1994 and the
statement of its President of 10 February 2000 (S/PRST/2000/4),

Welcoming and encouraging efforts by the United Nations to sensitize
peacekeeping personnel in the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS and other
communicable diseases in all its peacekeeping operations,

1. Authorizes the United Nations military observers to continue monitoring
the demilitarization of the Prevlaka peninsula, in accordance with resolutions 779
(1992) and 981 (1995) and paragraphs 19 and 20 of the report of the Secretary-
General of 13 December 1995 (S/1995/1028), until 15 January 2001;

2. Reiterates its calls upon the parties to cease all violations of the
demilitarized regime in the United Nations designated zones, to take steps further to
reduce tension and to improve safety and security in the area, to cooperate fully with
the United Nations military observers and to ensure their safety and full and
unrestricted freedom of movement;

3. Notes with concern the lack of progress by the parties in devising means
of implementing the recommendations and options to develop confidence-building
measures with which they were provided pursuant to its request in resolution 1252
(1999), encourages the parties to take concrete steps to implement such
recommendations and options with a view to, inter alia, further facilitating the
freedom of movement of the civilian population, and requests the Secretary-General
to report on the matter by 15 October 2000;

4. Urges once again that the parties abide by their mutual commitments and
implement fully the Agreement on Normalization of Relations, and stresses in
particular the urgent need for them to fulfil rapidly and in good faith their
commitment to reach a negotiated resolution of the disputed issue of Prevlaka in
accordance with article 4 of the Agreement;

5. Requests the parties to continue to report at least bi-monthly to the
Secretary-General on the status of their bilateral negotiations;

6. Reiterates its call upon the parties to put a comprehensive demining
programme in place in the identified minefields in the UNMOP area of
responsibility;



3

S/2000/681

7. Requests the United Nations military observers and the multinational
stabilization force authorized by the Council in resolution 1088 (1996) of 12
December 1996 and extended by resolution 1305 (2000) of 21 June 2000 to
cooperate fully with each other;

8. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
