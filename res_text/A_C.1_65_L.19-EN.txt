 The General Assembly, 

 Guided by the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United 
Nations and the rules of humanitarian international law, 

 Recalling its resolutions 62/30 of 5 December 2007 and 63/54 of 2 December 
2008,  

 Determined to promote multilateralism as an essential means to carry forward 
negotiations on arms regulation and disarmament, 

 Taking note of the opinions expressed by Member States and relevant 
international organizations on the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions 
containing depleted uranium, as reflected in the reports submitted by the Secretary-
General pursuant to resolutions 62/30 and 63/54,1  

 Recognizing the importance of implementing, as appropriate, the 
recommendations by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations 
Environmental Programme and the World Health Organization to mitigate potential 
hazards to human beings and the environment from the contamination of territories 
with depleted uranium residues,  

 Considering that studies conducted so far by relevant international 
organizations have not provided a detailed enough account of the magnitude of the 
potential long-term effects on human beings and the environment of the use of 
armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium,

 Convinced that, as humankind becomes more aware of the need to take 
immediate measures to protect the environment, any event that could jeopardize 
such efforts requires urgent attention to implement the required measures,

and ammunitions containing depleted uranium on human health and the 
environment,  

 1. Expresses its appreciation to the Member States and international 
organizations that submitted their views to the Secretary-General pursuant to 
resolution 63/54; 

 2. Invites Member States and relevant international organizations, 
particularly those that have not yet done so, to communicate to the Secretary-
General their views on the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions 
containing depleted uranium; 

 3. Requests the Secretary-General to request relevant international 
organizations to update and complete, as appropriate, their studies and research on 
the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium 
on human health and the environment; 

 4. Encourages Member States, particularly the affected States, as necessary, 
to facilitate the studies and research referred to in paragraph 3 above; 

 5. Also encourages Member States to follow closely the development of the 
studies and research referred to in paragraph 3 above; 

 6. Invites Member States that have used armaments and ammunitions 
containing depleted uranium in armed conflicts to provide the relevant authorities of 
affected States, upon request, with information, as detailed as possible, about the 
location of the areas of use and the amounts used, with the objective of facilitating 
the assessment of such areas; 

 7. Requests the Secretary-General to submit an updated report on this 
subject to the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, reflecting the 
information presented by Member States and relevant international organizations, 
including the information presented pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 above;
