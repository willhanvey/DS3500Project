will of the people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural 

systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives,  

 Reaffirming also that, while democracies share common features, there is no 

single model of democracy and that democracy does not belong to any country or 

region, and reaffirming further the necessity of due respect for sovereignty and the 

right to self-determination, 

 Stressing that democracy, development and respect for all human rights and 

fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing,  

 Reaffirming that Member States are responsible for organizing, conducting and 

ensuring transparent, free and fair electoral processes and that Member States, in the 

exercise of their sovereignty, may request that international organizations provide 

advisory services or assistance for strengthening and developing their electoral 

institutions and processes, including sending preliminary missions for that purpose,  

 Recognizing the importance of fair, periodic and genuine elections, including 

in new democracies and countries undergoing democratization, in order to empower 

citizens to express their will and to promote successful transition to long -term

 Emphasizing that Member States are responsible for respecting the will of the 

voters as expressed through genuine, periodic, free and fair elections, which shall be 

by universal and equal suffrage, and in this respect expressing serious concern about 

the unconstitutional or unlawful disruption of representative governance and 

democratic institutions and the unlawful removal of any democratically elected 

officials, whether by States or non-state actors,

promotion of democratization are provided only at the specific request of the 

Member State concerned, 

 Noting with satisfaction that increasing numbers of Member States are using 

elections as a peaceful means of discerning the will of the people, which builds 

confidence in representational governance and contributes to greater national peace 

and stability, and which may contribute to regional peace and stability,  

 Recalling the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted on 

10 December 1948,
5
 in particular the principle that the will of the people, as 

expressed through periodic and genuine elections, shall be the basis of government

by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures,  

 Reaffirming the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
6
 the 

Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,
7
 the 

International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination

 and reaffirming also 

that no distinctions are permitted among citizens on any grounds, such as race, 

colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, 

property, birth or other status, or on the basis of disability, in the enjoyment of the 

right to participate, directly or through freely chosen representatives, and to vote
