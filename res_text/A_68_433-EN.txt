the International Renewable Energy Agency, in line with General Assembly 
resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970;  

 7. Recalls with satisfaction the establishment and operation of the Tokelau

Britain and Northern Ireland and the stated position of the Government of the 
United States of America on the Non-Self-Governing Territories under their 
administration, 

 Noting also the constitutional developments in some Non-Self-Governing 
Territories affecting the internal structure of governance about which the Special 
Committee has received information, 

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories 
should continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 
referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 
important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people, 

 Convinced also that any negotiations to determine the status of a Territory 
must take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of that 
Territory, under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that 
the views of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories in respect of their 
right to self-determination should be ascertained, 

 Noting that a number of Non-Self-Governing Territories have expressed 
concern at the procedure followed by some administering Powers, contrary to the 
wishes of the Territories themselves, of amending or enacting legislation for 
application to the Territories, either through orders in council, in order to apply to 
the Territories the international treaty obligations of the administering Power, or 
through the unilateral application of laws and regulations, 

 Aware of the importance of the international financial services and tourism 
sectors for the economies of some of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, 

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the 
local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional 
organizations, 

 Mindful that United Nations visiting and special missions provide an effective 
means of ascertaining the situation in the Territories, that some Territories have not 
received a United Nations visiting mission for a long time and that no visiting 
missions have been sent to some of the Territories, and considering the possibility of 
sending further visiting missions to the Territories at an appropriate time, in 
consultation with the relevant administering Powers and in accordance with the 
relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations on decolonization, 

 Mindful also that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its 
understanding of the political status of the peoples of the Territories and to fulfil its 
mandate effectively, it is important for it to be apprised by the relevant 
administering Powers and to receive information from other appropriate sources, 
including the representatives of the Territories, concerning the wishes and 
aspirations of the peoples of the Territories, 

 Acknowledging the regular transmission by the administering Powers to the 
Secretary-General of information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter,

 Recognizing the need for the Special Committee to ensure that the appropriate 
bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at 
assisting the peoples of the Territories in gaining a better understanding of the 
options for self-determination, 

 Mindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the 
Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 
representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 
the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate, and that the regional nature of the 
seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial 
element in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political 
status of the Territories, 

 Noting the stated positions of the representatives of the Non-Self-Governing 
Territories before the Special Committee and at its regional seminars, 

 Welcoming the 2013 Caribbean regional seminar held by the Special 
Committee in Quito from 28 to 30 May 2013, as a significant and forward-looking 
event, which enabled the participants to assess the progress made in the 
decolonization process and to review the Committee’s existing working methods 
and renew its momentum in implementing its historic task, 

 Recognizing the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted 
by the seminar, which are annexed to the report of the Special Committee4 and 
which outline the findings of the seminar, including, especially, the way forward for 
the decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General 
Assembly of the period 2011-2020 as the Third International Decade for the 
Eradication of Colonialism, 

 Conscious of the particular vulnerability of the Territories to natural disasters 
and environmental degradation, and in that connection bearing in mind the 
applicability to the Territories of the programmes of action or outcome documents 
of all United Nations world conferences and special sessions of the General 
Assembly in the economic and social spheres, 

 Noting with appreciation the contribution to the development of some 
Territories by the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations

Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and the Economic and Social 
Commission for Asia and the Pacific, as well as regional institutions such as the
