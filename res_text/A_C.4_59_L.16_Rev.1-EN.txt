The General Assembly,

Guided by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and affirming
the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force,

Recalling its relevant resolutions, including resolution 58/292 of 6 May 2004,
as well as those resolutions adopted at its tenth emergency special session,

Recalling also relevant Security Council resolutions, including resolutions 242
(1967) of 22 November 1967, 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979, 465 (1980) of 1 March

A/C.4/59/L.16/Rev.1

Recalling the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International
Court of Justice on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the
Occupied Palestinian Territory,3 and recalling also General Assembly resolution
ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004,

Noting that the Court concluded that “the Israeli settlements in the Occupied
Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of
international law”,4

Taking note of the recent report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission
on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories
occupied by Israel since 1967,5

Recalling the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government
Arrangements of 13 September 19936 and the subsequent implementation
agreements between the Palestinian and Israeli sides,

Recalling also the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State solution to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict,7 and noting specifically its call for a freeze on all
settlement activity,

Aware that Israeli settlement activities have involved, inter alia, the transfer of
nationals of the occupying Power into the occupied territories, the confiscation of
land, the exploitation of natural resources and other illegal actions against the
Palestinian civilian population,

Bearing in mind the detrimental impact of Israeli settlement policies, decisions
and activities on efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East,

Expressing grave concern about the continuation by Israel, the occupying
Power, of settlement activities, in violation of international humanitarian law,
relevant United Nations resolutions and the agreements reached between the parties,
including the construction and expansion of the settlements in Jabal Abu-Ghneim
and Ras Al-Amud in and around Occupied East Jerusalem,

Expressing grave concern also about the continuing unlawful construction by
Israel of the wall inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around
East Jerusalem, and expressing its concern in particular about the route of the wall
in departure from the Armistice Line of 1949, which could prejudge future
negotiations and make the two-State solution physically impossible to implement
and which is causing the Palestinian people further humanitarian hardship,

Deeply concerned that the wall’s route has been traced in such a way as to
include the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian
Territory, including East Jerusalem,

Reiterating its opposition to settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian
Territory, including East Jerusalem, and to any activities involving the confiscation
of land, the disruption of the livelihood of protected persons and the de facto
annexation of land,

Recalling the need to end all acts of violence, including acts of terror,
provocation, incitement and destruction,

Gravely concerned about the dangerous situation resulting from actions taken
by the illegal armed Israeli settlers in the occupied territory,

Taking note of the relevant reports of the Secretary-General,8

1. Reaffirms that Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territory, including
East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan are illegal and an obstacle to
peace and economic and social development;

2. Calls upon Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the Geneva
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of
12 August 1949,1 to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem,
and to the occupied Syrian Golan and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the
Convention, in particular article 49;

activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the

obligations, as mentioned in the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the
International Court of Justice;3

5. Stresses the need for full implementation of Security Council resolution
904 (1994), in which, among other things, the Council called upon Israel, the
occupying Power, to continue to take and implement measures, including
confiscation of arms, with the aim of preventing illegal acts of violence by Israeli
settlers, and called for measures to be taken to guarantee the safety and protection of
the Palestinian civilians in the occupied territory;

6. Reiterates its calls for the prevention of all acts of violence by Israeli
settlers, especially against Palestinian civilians and property, particularly in the light
of recent developments;

7. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its
sixtieth session on the implementation of the present resolution.
