 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its resolutions 1325 (2000), 1820 (2008), 1889 (2009), 1960 (2010), 

2106 (2013), 2122 (2013) and 2242 (2015) on Women, Peace and Security and all 

relevant statements of its President, its resolutions on Countering Terrorism 2178 

(2014) and 2195 (2014) and the Statement of its President S/PRST/2015/11, and the 

Statements of its President on Post-Conflict Peacebuilding S/PRST/2012/29 and 

S/PRST/2015/2, 

 Recalling its resolutions 1265 (1999) and 1894 (2009) on the Protection of 

Civilians in Armed Conflict, 

 Bearing in mind the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United 

Nations and the primary responsibility of the Security Council under the Charter for 

the maintenance of international peace and security,  

 Noting that the term youth is defined in the context of this resolution as 

persons of the age of 18-29 years old, and further noting the variations of definition 

of the term that may exist on the national and international levels, including the 

definition of youth in the General Assembly resolutions A/RES/50/81 and 

A/RES/56/117, 

 Recognizing that today’s generation of youth is the largest the world has ever 

known and that young people often form the majority of the population of countries 

affected by armed conflict, 

 Expressing concern that among civilians, youth account for many of those 

adversely affected by armed conflict, including as refugees and internally displaced 

persons, and that the disruption of youth’s access to education and economic 

opportunities has a dramatic impact on durable peace and reconciliation,  

 Recognizing the important and positive contribution of youth in efforts for the 

maintenance and promotion of peace and security, 

 Affirming the important role youth can play in the prevention and resolution of 

conflicts and as a key aspect of the sustainability, inclusiveness and success of 

peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts,

 Recognizing that youth should actively be engaged in shaping lasting peace 

and contributing to justice and reconciliation, and that a large youth population 

presents a unique demographic dividend that can contribute to lasting peace and 

economic prosperity if inclusive policies are in place, 

 Recognizing that the rise of radicalization to violence and violent extremism, 

especially among youth, threatens stability and development, and can often derail 

peacebuilding efforts and foment conflict, and stressing the importance of 

addressing conditions and factors leading to the rise of radicalization to violence 

and violent extremism among youth, which can be conducive to terrorism,  

 Expressing concern over the increased use, in a globalized society, by 

terrorists and their supporters of new information and communication technologies, 

in particular the Internet, for the purposes of recruitment and incitement of youth to 

commit terrorist acts, as well as for the financing, planning and preparation of their 

activities, and underlining the need for Member States to act cooperatively to 

prevent terrorists from exploiting technology, communications and resources to 

incite support for terrorist acts, while respecting human rights and fundamental 

freedoms and in compliance with other obligations under international law, 

 Noting the important role youth can play further as positive role models in 

preventing and countering violent extremism, which can be conducive to terrorism, 

and fuels conflict, inhibits socioeconomic development and fosters regional and 

international insecurity, 

 Noting that the Secretary-General is finalizing a Plan of Action to Prevent 

Violent Extremism to integrate youth’s participation, leadership and empowerment 

as core to the United Nations strategy and responses,  

 Noting the World Programme of Action for Youth, the Guiding Principles on 

Young People’s Participation in Peacebuilding, the August 2015 Global Forum on 

Youth, Peace and Security, the Amman Declaration on Youth, Peace and Security, 

the September 2015 Global Youth Summit against Violent Extremism and the 

Action Agenda to Prevent Violent Extremism and Promote Peace, and 

acknowledging their role in creating a foundation that promotes young people’s 

inclusive participation and positive contribution to building peace in conflict and 

post-conflict situations, 

 Acknowledging the on-going work of national governments and regional and 

international organizations to engage youth in building and maintaining peace,  

 Encouraging Member States to consider developing a UN common approach 

to inclusive development as a key for preventing conflict and enabling long-term 

stability and sustainable peace, and highlighting in this regard the importance of 

identifying and addressing social, economic, political, cultural and religious 

exclusion, intolerance, as well as violent extremism, which can be conducive to 

terrorism, as drivers of conflict,  

 Recognizing that the protection of youth during conflict and post -conflict and 

their participation in peace processes can significantly contribute to the maintenance 

and promotion of international peace and security, and being convinced that the 

protection of civilians, including youth, in armed conflict should be an important 

aspect of any comprehensive strategy to resolve conflict and build peace,
