economic, social and cultural development and that every State has the duty to respect 

this right in accordance with the provisions of the Charter,  

 Deeply concerned at the continuation of acts or threats of foreign military 

intervention and occupation that are threatening to suppress, or have already 

suppressed, the right to self-determination of peoples and nations,  

 Reaffirming the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning 

Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of 

the United Nations,3  

 Acknowledging with appreciation the work and contributions of the open-ended 

intergovernmental working group established by the Human Rights Council with the 

mandate of considering the possibility of elaborating an international regulatory 

framework, including the option of elaborating a legally binding instrument on the 

regulation, monitoring and oversight of the activities of private military and security 

companies, 

 Alarmed and concerned at the danger that the activities of mercenaries 

constitute to peace and security in developing countries in various parts of the world, 

in particular in areas of armed conflict, and about the threat they pose to the integrity 

of and respect for the constitutional order of the affected countries,  

 Deeply concerned at the loss of life, the substantial damage to property and the 

negative effects on the policies and economies of affected countries resulting from 

international criminal mercenary activities, 

 Convinced that, notwithstanding the way in which mercenaries or mercenary-

related activities are used or the form that they take to acquire some semblance of 

legitimacy, they are a threat to peace, security and the self-determination of peoples 

and an obstacle to the enjoyment of all human rights by peoples,  

 1. Takes note with appreciation of the latest report of the Working Group of 

the Human Rights Council on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human 

rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination;4  

 2. Reaffirms that the use of mercenaries and their recruitment, financing, 

protection and training are causes for grave concern to all States and that they violate 

the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations;  

 3. Recognizes that armed conflict, terrorism, arms trafficking and covert 

operations by third Powers encourage, inter alia, the demand for mercenaries on the 

global market; 

 4. Urges, once again, all States to take the steps necessary and to exercise the 

utmost vigilance against the menace posed by the activities of mercenaries and to take 

legislative measures to ensure that their territories and other territories under their 

control are not used for, and that their nationals do not take part in, the recruitment, 

assembly, financing, training, protection or transit of mercenaries for the planning of 

activities designed to impede the right of peoples to self -determination, to destabilize 

or overthrow the Government of any State or to dismember or impair, totally or in 

part, the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent States 

conducting themselves in accordance with the right of peoples to self -determination; 

 5. Requests all States to exercise the utmost vigilance against any kind of 

recruitment, training, hiring or financing of mercenaries by private companies 

offering international military consultancy and security services, and to impose a

specific ban on such companies intervening in armed conflicts or actions to 

destabilize constitutional regimes;  

 6. Encourages States that import military assistance or consultancy and 

security services provided by private companies to establish national regulatory 

mechanisms for registering and licensing those companies in order to ensure that the 

imported services provided by those private companies neither impede the enjoyment 

of human rights nor violate human rights in the recipient country;  

 7. Emphasizes its utmost concern about the impact of the activities of private 

military and security companies on the enjoyment of human rights, in particular when 

operating in armed conflicts, and notes that private military and security companies 

and their personnel are rarely held accountable for violations of human rights;  

 8. Calls upon all States that have not yet done so to consider acceding to or 

ratifying the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and 

Training of Mercenaries;5  

 9. Welcomes the cooperation extended by those countries that have received 

a visit by the Working Group on the use of mercenaries since the establishment of its 

mandate and the adoption by some States of national legislation that restricts the 

recruitment, assembly, financing, training and transit of mercenaries;  

 10. Condemns recent mercenary activities in developing countries in various 

parts of the world, in particular in areas of conflict, and the threat they pose to the 

integrity of and respect for the constitutional order of those countries and the exercise 

of the right of their peoples to self-determination, and stresses the importance for the 

Working Group on the use of mercenaries of looking into sources and root causes, as 

well as the political motivations of mercenaries and for mercenary-related activities; 

 11. Calls upon States to investigate the possibility of mercenary involvement 

whenever and wherever criminal acts of a terrorist nature occur and to bring to trial 

those found responsible or to consider their extradit ion, if so requested, in accordance 

with national law and applicable bilateral or international treaties;  

 12. Condemns any form of impunity granted to perpetrators of mercenary 

activities and to those responsible for the use, recruitment, financing and tr aining of 

mercenaries, and urges all States, in accordance with their obligations under 

international law, to bring them, without distinction, to justice;  

 13. Calls upon Member States, in accordance with their obligations under 

international law, to cooperate with and assist the judicial prosecution of those 

accused of mercenary activities in transparent, open and fair trials;  

 14. Requests the Working Group on the use of mercenaries and other experts 

to continue their participation, including by submitting contributions, in other 

subsidiary bodies of the Human Rights Council considering issues related to the use 

of mercenaries and mercenary-related activities in all their forms and manifestations, 

including private military and security companies;  

 15. Requests the Working Group on the use of mercenaries to continue its work 

with respect to the strengthening of the international legal framework for the 

prevention and sanction of the recruitment, use, financing and training of 

mercenaries, taking into account the proposal for a new legal definition of a 

mercenary drafted by the Special Rapporteur on the use of mercenaries as a means of 

impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self -determination in his report

peoples to self-determination; 

 17. Requests the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human

activities;

phenomenon of private military and security companies, as contracting States, States 

of operations, home States or States whose nationals are employed to work for a

demands of its current and future activities;  

 21. Requests the Working Group on the use of mercenaries to consult States

of peoples to self-determination;
