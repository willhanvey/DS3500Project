III. RECOMMENDATION OF THE FIRST COMMITTEE 

A/40/919

Page 3 

7. The First Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the 
following draft resolution: 

Implementation of General Assembly resolution 39/51 concerning 
the signature and ratification of Additional Protocol I of the 
Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America 

(Treaty of Tlatelolco) 

The General Assembly, 

Recalling its resolutions 2286 (XXII) of 5 December 1967, 3262 (XXIX) of 
9 December 1974, 3473 (XXX) of 11 December 1975, 32/76 of 12 December 1977, 
S-10/2 of 30 June 1978, 33/58 of 14 December 1978, 34/71 of 11 December 1979, 
35/143 of 12 December 1980, 36/83 of 9 December 1981, 37/71 of 9 December 1982 
and 38/61 ot 15 December 1983 concerning the signature and ratification of 
Additional Protocol I of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in 
Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco), ll 

Taking into account that within the zone of application of that Treaty, to 
which 23 sovereign States are already parties, there are some territories 
which, in spite of not being sovereign political entities, are nevertheless in 
a position to receive the benefits deriving from the Treaty through its 
Additional Protocol I, to which the four States that de jure or de facto are 
internationally responsible for those territories may become parties, 

Considering that it would not be fair if the peoples of some of those 
territories were deprived of such benefits without being given the opportunity 
to express their opinion in this connection, 

Recalling that three of the States to whom Additional Protocol I is 
opened the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Kingdom 
of the Netherlands and the United States of America - became parties to the 
said Protocol in 1969, 1971 and 1981, respectively, 

la Deplores that the signature of Additional Protocol I by France, which 
took place on 2 March 1979, has not yet been followed by the corresponding 
ratification, notwithstanding the time already elapsed and the pressing 
invitations which the General Assembly has addressed to itJ 

2. Once more urges France not to delay any further such ratification, 
which has been requested so many times and which appears all the more 
advisable, since France is the only one of the four States to which the 
Protocol is open that is not yet party to it; 

3. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its forty-first 
session an item entitled wrmplementation of General Assembly resolution 40L__ 
concerning the signature and ratification of Additional Protocol I of the 
Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of 
Tlatelolco)".
