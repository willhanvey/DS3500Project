  Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Reiterating that the cessation of nuclear-weapon test explosions or any other 

nuclear explosions constitutes an effective nuclear disarmament and 

non-proliferation measure, and convinced that this is a meaningful step in the 

realization of a systematic process for achieving nuclear disarmament, 

 Recalling that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, adopted by the 

General Assembly by its resolution 50/245 of 10 September 1996, was opened for 

signature on 24 September 1996,  

 Stressing that a universal and effectively verifiable Treaty constitutes a 

fundamental instrument in the field of nuclear disarmament and non -proliferation 

and that, after nearly 20 years, its entry into force is more urgent than ever before,  

 Encouraged by the signing of the Treaty by 183 States, including 41 of the 44 

whose ratification is needed for its entry into force, and welcoming the ratification 

of the Treaty by 164 States, including 36 of the 44 whose ratification is needed for 

its entry into force, among which there are 3 nuclear -weapon States, 



A/C.1/70/L.46 
 

 

15-18370 2/3 

 

 Recalling its resolution 69/81 of 2 December 2014, 

 Recalling also the adoption by consensus of the conclusions and 

recommendations for follow-on actions of the 2010 Review Conference of the 

Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,
1
 in which the 

Conference, inter alia, reaffirmed the vital importance of the entry into force of the 

Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as a core element of the international 

nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and included specific actions to 

be taken in support of the entry into force of the Treaty,  

 Welcoming the Final Declaration adopted by the ninth Conference on 

Facilitating the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear -Test-Ban Treaty, 

held in New York on 29 September 2015, convened pursuant to article XIV of  

the Treaty, and recalling the Joint Ministerial Statement on the Comprehensive 

Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, adopted at the ministerial meeting held in New York on 

26 September 2014, 

 Noting that the group of eminent persons, established to support the Article XIV 

process, met in Seoul on 25 and 26 June and Hiroshima, Japan, on 24 and 25 August 

2015, where they called for a multilateral approach to engage the leadership of the 

remaining eight Annex 2 States with the aim of facilitating their respective 

ratification processes, 

 Welcoming continuing progress in the development of the Treaty’s verification 

regime, including as demonstrated in the on-site inspection Integrated Field 

Exercise held in Jordan in November and December 2014, 

 1. Stresses the vital importance and urgency of signature and ratification, 

without delay and without conditions, in order to achieve the earliest entry into 

force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty;
2
 

 2. Welcomes the contributions by the signatory States to the work of the 

Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, 

in particular its efforts to ensure that the verification regime of the Treaty will be 

capable of meeting the verification requirements of the Treaty upon its entry into 

force, in accordance with article IV of the Treaty;  

 3. Underlines the need to maintain momentum towards completion of all 

elements of the verification regime;  

 4. Urges all States not to carry out nuclear-weapon test explosions or any 

other nuclear explosions, to maintain their moratoriums in this regard and to refrain 

from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of the Treaty, while stressing that 

these measures do not have the same permanent and legally binding effect as the 

entry into force of the Treaty;  

 5. Shares the grave concern of the Security Council about the nuclear test 

conducted by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on 12 February 2013, 

expressed in Council resolution 2094 (2013) of 7 March 2013, recalls Council 

resolutions 1718 (2006) of 14 October 2006 and 1874 (2009) of 12 June 2009,
