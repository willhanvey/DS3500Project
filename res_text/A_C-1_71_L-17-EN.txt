 Noting that considerable progress has been achieved in developing and

effectiveness is enhanced by broad international cooperation,

stability and security and may adversely affect the integrity of the infrastructure of 

States to the detriment of their security in both civil and military fields,

 Welcoming the conclusions of the Group of Governmental Experts,  in its 2013 

and 2015 reports,4,3 that international law, and in particular the Charter of the 

United Nations, is applicable and essential to maintaining peace and stability and 

promoting an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful information and 

communications technology environment, that voluntary and non -binding norms, 

rules and principles of responsible behaviour of States in the use of information and 

communications technologies can reduce risks to international peace, security and 

stability, and that, given the unique attributes of such technologies, additional norms 

can be developed over time, 

 1. Calls upon Member States: 

 (a) To be guided in their use of information and communications 

technologies by the 2015 report of the Group of Governmental Experts on 

Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context 

of International Security;
3
 

 (b) To promote further, at multilateral levels, the consideration of existing 

and potential threats in the field of information security, as well as possible 

strategies to address the threats emerging in this field, consistent with the need to 

preserve the free flow of information;  

 2. Considers that the purpose of such measures could be served through 

further examination of relevant international concepts aimed at strengthening the 

security of global information and telecommunications systems;  

 3. Invites all Member States, taking into account the assessments and 

recommendations contained in the report of the Group of Governmental Experts, to 

continue to inform the Secretary-General of their views and assessments on the 

following questions: 

 (a) General appreciation of the issues of information security;  

 (b) Efforts taken at the national level to strengthen information security and 

promote international cooperation in this field;  

 (c) The content of the concepts mentioned in paragraph 2 above;  

 (d) Possible measures that could be taken by the international community to 

strengthen information security at the global level; 

 4. Welcomes the commencement of the work of the Group of Governmental 

Experts, established by the Secretary-General pursuant to resolution 70/237 on the 

basis of equitable geographical distribution, which, in accordance with its mandate, 

taking into account the assessments and recommendations contained in the above-

mentioned report, should continue to study, with a view to promoting common 

understandings, existing and potential threats in the sphere of information security 

and possible cooperative measures to address them and how international law 

applies to the use of information and communications technologies by States, as 

well as norms, rules and principles of responsible  behaviour of States, confidence-

building measures and capacity-building and the concepts referred to in paragraph 2
