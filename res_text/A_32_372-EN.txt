5 December 1967, 2456 B (XXIII) of 20 December 1968, 2666 (XXV) of 7 December 1970,
2830 (XXVI) of 16 December 1971, 2935 (XXVII) of 29 November 1972, 3079 (XXVIII)
of 6 December 1973, 3258 (XXIX) of 9 December 1974, 3467 (XXX) of 11 December 1975
and 31/67 of 10 December 1976, nine of which contain appeals to the nuclear-weapon
States regarding the signature and ratification of Additional Protocol 11 of the
Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of
Tlatelolco) ,

Reiterating its firm conviction that, for the maximum effectiveness of any
treaty establishing a nuclear-weapon-·free zone, the co-operation of the nuclear-
weapon States is necessary and that such co-operation should take the form of
commitments likewise undertaken in a formal international instrument which is
legally binding, such as a treaty, convention or protocol,

Recalling with particular satisfaction that the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of America, France and the People's
Republic of China are already parties to Additional Protocol 11 of the Treaty for
the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco),

Noting that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has submitted to the
General Assembly at its thirty-second session a draft resolution, 1/ in operative
paragraph 6 of which it is Ii solemnly urged" that:

"All non-nuclear-weapon States should establish nuclear-weapon-·free
zones~ which may cover entire continents or large geographical areas, as well
as groups of States or individual States, and nuclear States should respect
the status of such nuclear-free zones 17 9

1. Again urges the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to sign and ratify
Additional Protocol 11 of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in
Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco);

2. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its thirty-third session
an item entitled "Implementation of General Assembly resolution 32/__ concerning
the signature and ratification of Additional Protocol 11 of the Treaty for the
Prohibition of lluclear Heapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco)".
