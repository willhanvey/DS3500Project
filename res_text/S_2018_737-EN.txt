 The Security Council,  

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 14 June 2018 on his Good 

Offices (S/2018/610) and of 6 July 2018 (S/2018/676) on the United Nations 

operation in Cyprus,  

 Noting that the Government of Cyprus is agreed that in view of the prevailing 

conditions on the island it is necessary to keep the United Nations Peacekeeping Force 

in Cyprus (UNFICYP) beyond 31 July 2018,  

 Echoing the Secretary-General’s firm belief that the responsibility for finding a 

solution lies first and foremost with the Cypriots themselves, and reaffirming the 

primary role of the United Nations in assisting the parties to bring the Cyprus conflict 

and division of the island to a comprehensive and durable settlement,  

 Welcoming the commitments set out in the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot 

leaders’ Joint Statement of 2 April 2017 on the basis of the Joint Declaration adopted 

on 11 February 2014, the reconvening of the Conference on Cyprus under United 

Nations auspices in June 2017, further welcoming the participants ’ commitment to 

support the process towards a comprehensive settlement in Cyprus, and the support 

provided by the Secretary-General and Secretary-General’s Special Representative 

Elizabeth Spehar,  

 Recalling resolution 1179 (1998); and the importance attached by the 

international community to all parties engaging fully, flexibly and constructively in 

negotiations to secure a settlement and noting that last year’s Conference on Cyprus 

did not result in an enduring, comprehensive and just settlement based on a 

bicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality, as set out in relevant Security 

Council resolutions, urging the sides to renew their commitment to such a settlement, 

and stressing that the status quo is unsustainable,  

 Welcoming the appointment of UN Consultant Jane Holl Lute, and urging the 

sides and all involved parties to demonstrate political will and engage constructively 

with UN consultations,  

 Noting the need to advance the consideration of and discussions on mil itary 

confidence-building measures, calling for renewed efforts to implement all remaining 

confidence-building measures, and for agreement on and implementation of further 

joint and unilateral steps to build trust between the communities, including new 

confidence-building measures,

 Reaffirming the importance of continued crossings of the Green Line by 

Cypriots, and encouraging the opening by mutual agreement of other crossing points,  

 Convinced of the many important benefits, including economic benefits for all 

Cypriots, that would flow from a comprehensive and durable Cyprus settlement, 

urging the two sides and their leaders to foster positive public rhetoric, and 

encouraging them clearly to explain the benefits of the settlement, as well as the need 

for increased flexibility and compromise in order to secure it, to both communities 

well in advance of any referenda,  

 Highlighting the importance, both political and financial, of the supporting role 

of the international community, and in particular that of all parties concerned in taking 

practical steps towards helping the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders to 

renew their commitment to a settlement under United Nations auspices; taking note 

of the assessment of the Secretary-General that the security situation on the island 

and along the Green Line remains stable, and urging all sides to avoid any action, 

including violations of the military status quo, which could lead to an increase in 

tension, undermine the progress achieved so far, or damage the goodwill on the island,  

 Recalling the Secretary-General’s firm belief that the situation in the buffer zone 

would be improved if both sides accept and actively assist UNFICYP in the 

implementation of the aide-memoire in use by the United Nations,  

 Noting with regret that the sides are withholding access to the remaining 

minefields in the buffer zone, and that demining in Cyprus must continue, noting the 

continued danger posed by mines in Cyprus, noting also proposals and discussions as 

well as positive initiatives on demining, and urging rapid agreement on facilitating 

the recommencement of demining operations and clearance of the remaining 

minefields,  

 Commending the work of the Committee on Missing Persons, highlighting the 

importance of intensifying its activities, and therefore the need to provide all 

information required as expressed in the press release of the Committee on Missing 

Persons on 28 July 2016 regarding review of archival materials, noting that the 

remains of 1,132 missing persons, from a total of 2002, have not yet been positively 

identified, urging the opening up of access to all areas expeditiously to allow the 

Committee to carry out its work, and trusting that this process will promote 

reconciliation between the communities,  

 Agreeing that the active participation and leadership of women is essential to 

the political process and can contribute to making any future settlement sustainable, 

recalling that women play a critically important role in peace processes as recognized 

in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, and related resolutions; 

recalling Resolution 2242 (2015) and its aspiration to increase the number of women 

in military and police contingents of United Nations peacekeeping missions; and 

further recalling the importance of the active participation of youth, consistent with 

Resolution 2250,  

 Urging the sides to step up their efforts to promote intercommunal contacts, 

reconciliation and the active engagement of civil society, including Bi -Communal 

Initiatives and development projects where the two communities can work together 

and jointly benefit, and the encouragement of cooperation between economic and 

commercial bodies and to remove all obstacles to such contacts, while also noting 

various initiatives to bring together particular sectors or  actors on both sides for 

dialogue, including the Religious Track of the Cyprus Peace Process,

peacekeeping deployments,

 Recalling resolution 2378 (2017) which requests the Secretary-General to 

ensure that data related to the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations, including 

performance data, is used to improve analytics and evaluation of mission operations, 

based on clear and well identified benchmarks, and emphasizing the need to regularly 

review all peacekeeping operations including UNFICYP to ensure efficiency and 

effectiveness,  

 Noting the importance of transition planning in relation to the settlement,

developments on the ground and the views of the parties,
