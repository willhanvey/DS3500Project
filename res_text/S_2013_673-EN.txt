 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General (S/2013/623), as requested by 
resolution 2077 (2012), on the implementation of that resolution and on the situation 
with respect to piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, 

 Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political 
independence and unity of Somalia, including Somalia’s sovereign rights in 
accordance with international law, with respect to offshore natural resources, 
including fisheries,  

 While welcoming the significant decrease in reported incidents of piracy off 
the coast of Somalia, which are at the lowest level since 2006, continuing to be 
gravely concerned by the on-going threat that piracy and armed robbery at sea pose 
to the prompt, safe, and effective delivery of humanitarian aid to Somalia and the 
region, to the safety of seafarers and other persons, to international navigation and 
the safety of commercial maritime routes, and to other vulnerable ships, including 
fishing activities in conformity with international law, and also gravely concerned 
by the extended range of the piracy threat into the western Indian Ocean and 
adjacent sea areas and increased pirate capacities,  

 Expressing concern about the reported involvement of children in piracy off 
the coast of Somalia, 

 Recognizing that the on-going instability in Somalia contributes to the problem 
of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, and stressing the need 
to continue the comprehensive response by the international community to repress 
piracy and armed robbery at sea and tackle its underlying causes, recognizing the 
need to undertake long-term and sustainable efforts to repress piracy and the need to

 Recognizing the need to investigate and prosecute not only suspects captured 
at sea, but also anyone who incites or intentionally facilitates piracy operations, 
including key figures of criminal networks involved in piracy who plan, organize, 
facilitate, or illicitly finance or profit from such attacks, and reiterating its concern 
over persons suspected of piracy having been released without facing justice, 
reaffirming that the failure to prosecute persons responsible for acts of piracy and 
armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia undermines anti-piracy efforts, 

 Noting the report of the Secretary-General (S/2013/623), particularly Section IX 
on “Allegations of illegal fishing and illegal dumping, including of toxic substances, 
off the coast of Somalia”, 

 Further reaffirming that international law, as reflected in the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (“The Convention”), sets 
out the legal framework applicable to activities in the ocean, including countering 
piracy and armed robbery at sea, 

 Underlining the primary responsibility of the Somali authorities in the fight 
against piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia; noting the several 
requests from Somali authorities for international assistance to counter piracy off its

pirates and, in accordance with international law, to establish an on-going network 
and mechanism for sharing information and evidence between investigators and 
prosecutors, welcoming the development of the Capacity Building Coordination 
Group under Working Group 1 of the CGPCS, and welcoming the work by Working 
Group 5 of the CGPCS to disrupt illicit financial flows linked to piracy,

the naval activities of the Southern Africa Development Community, and other 
States acting in a national capacity in cooperation with Somali authorities and each 
other, to suppress piracy and to protect vulnerable ships transiting through the 
waters off the coast of Somalia, and welcoming the Shared Awareness and 
Deconfliction Initiative (SHADE) and the efforts of individual countries, including 
China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, and the 
Russian Federation, which have deployed naval counter-piracy missions in the 
region, as stated in the Secretary-General’s report (S/2013/623), 

 Noting the efforts of flag States for taking measures to permit vessels sailing 
under their flag transiting the High Risk Area (HRA) to embark vessel protection 
detachments and privately contracted armed security personnel (PCASP), and 
encouraging States to regulate such activities in accordance with applicable 
international law and permit charters to favour arrangements that make use of such 
measures, 

 Noting the request of some Member States on the need to review the 
boundaries of the HRA on an objective and transparent basis, taking into account 
actual incidents of piracy, and noting that the HRA is set and defined by the 
insurance and maritime industry, 

 Welcoming the capacity-building efforts in the region made by the 
International Maritime Organization-(IMO)-funded Djibouti Code of Conduct, the 
Trust Fund and the European Union’s activities under EUCAP Nestor, which is 
working with the Federal Government of Somalia to strengthen its criminal justice 
system, and recognizing the need for all engaged international and regional 
organizations to coordinate and cooperate fully, 

 Supporting the development of a coastal police force, noting with appreciation 
the efforts made by the IMO and the shipping industry to develop and update 
guidance, best management practices, and recommendations to assist ships to 
prevent and suppress piracy attacks off the coast of Somalia, including in the Gulf 
of Aden, and the Indian Ocean area, and recognizing the work of the IMO and the 
CGPCS in this regard, noting the efforts of the International Organization for 
Standardization, which has developed industry standards of training and

contracted armed security personnel on board ships in high-risk areas, and further 
welcoming the European Union’s EUCAP Nestor, which is working to develop the 
sea-going maritime security capacities of Somalia, Djibouti, Kenya, Seychelles and 
Tanzania, 

 Noting with concern that the continuing limited capacity and domestic 
legislation to facilitate the custody and prosecution of suspected pirates after their 
capture has hindered more robust international action against the pirates off the 
coast of Somalia, too often has led to pirates being released without facing justice, 
regardless of whether there is sufficient evidence to support prosecution, and 
reiterating that, consistent with the provisions of “The Convention” concerning the 
repression of piracy, the 1988 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts 
Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (“SUA Convention”) provides for parties 
to create criminal offences, establish jurisdiction, and accept delivery of persons 
responsible for or suspected of seizing or exercising control over a ship by force or 
threat thereof or any other form of intimidation,

gain recruits, and continue their operational activities, thereby jeopardizing the 
safety and security of civilians and restricting the flow of free commerce, and 
welcoming international efforts to collect and share information to disrupt the pirate 
enterprise, as exemplified by INTERPOL’s Global Database on Maritime Piracy, 
and taking note of the on-going efforts of the Regional Fusion and Law Enforcement 
Centre for Safety and Security at Sea (formerly the Regional Anti-Piracy 
Prosecution and Intelligence Coordination Centre), hosted by Seychelles to combat 
piracy, 

 Reaffirming international condemnation of acts of kidnapping and hostage-
taking, including offences contained within the International Convention against the 
Taking of Hostages, strongly condemning the continuing practice of hostage-taking 
by pirates operating off the coast of Somalia, expressing serious concern at the 
inhuman conditions hostages face in captivity, recognizing the adverse impact on 
their families, calling for the immediate release of all hostages, and noting the 
importance of cooperation between Member States on the issue of hostage-taking 
and the prosecution of suspected pirates for taking hostages, 

 Commending Kenya, Mauritius, Seychelles and Tanzania for their efforts to 
prosecute suspected pirates in their national courts, and noting with appreciation the 
assistance provided by the UNODC Counter-Piracy Programme, the Trust Fund and 
other international organizations and donors, in coordination with the CGPCS, to 
support Kenya, Mauritius, Seychelles, Tanzania, Somalia, and other States in the 
region with their efforts to prosecute, or incarcerate in a third State after prosecution 
elsewhere, pirates, including facilitators and financiers ashore, consistent with 
applicable international human rights law, and emphasizing the need for States and 
international organizations to further enhance international efforts in this regard,

establishment of specialized Somali anti-piracy courts (S/2011/360 and S/2012/50), 
prepared pursuant to paragraph 26 of resolution 1976 (2011) and paragraph 16 of 
resolution 2015 (2011),  

 Stressing the need for States to consider possible methods to assist the 
seafarers who are victims of pirates, and welcoming in this regard the Trust Fund’s

public information tools to raise awareness of the dangers of piracy, highlight the 
best practices to eradicate this criminal phenomenon, and inform the public of the 
dangers posed by piracy,  

 Further noting with appreciation the on-going efforts by UNODC to support 
efforts to enhance Somalia’s maritime security and law enforcement capacities, also 
noting efforts by UNODC and UNDP and the funding provided by the Trust Fund, 
the European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other donors to 
develop regional judicial and law enforcement capacity to investigate, arrest, and 
prosecute suspected pirates and to incarcerate convicted pirates consistent with 
applicable international human rights law, 

 Bearing in mind the Djibouti Code of Conduct concerning the Repression of 
Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in the Western Indian Ocean and the Gulf 
of Aden, noting the operations of information-sharing centres in Yemen, Kenya and 
Tanzania and the regional maritime training centre in Djibouti, and recognizing the 
efforts of signatory States to develop the appropriate regulatory and legislative 
frameworks to combat piracy, enhance their capacity to patrol the waters of the 
region, interdict suspect vessels, and prosecute suspected pirates, 

 Emphasizing that peace and stability within Somalia, the strengthening of State 
institutions, economic and social development and respect for human rights and the 
rule of law are necessary to create the conditions for a durable eradication of piracy 
and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, and further emphasizing that 
Somalia’s long-term security rests with the effective development by Somali 
authorities of the Somali National Security Forces, 

 Noting with appreciation recent high-level events on Somalia which have 
generated substantial pledges of support, and underlining the importance of 
delivering on any support pledged at these events,

stronger national legal capacity and laws, and encouraging the Indian Ocean Rim 
Association to pursue efforts that are complementary to and coordinated with the 
on-going work of the CGPCS, 

 Noting that the joint counter-piracy efforts of the international community and 
private sector have resulted in a sharp decline in pirate attacks as well as hijackings 
since 2011 and emphasizing that without further action, the significant progress 
made in reducing the number of successful pirate attacks is reversible, 

 Determining that the incidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast 
of Somalia are an important factor exacerbating the situation in Somalia, which 
continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security in the region,

basing and logistical support for counter-piracy forces, and by seizing and disposing 
of boats, vessels, arms, and other related equipment used in the commission of 
piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, or for which there are 
reasonable grounds for suspecting such use; 

 11. Commends the work of the CGPCS to facilitate coordination in order to 
deter acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, in 
cooperation with the IMO, flag States, and Somali authorities and urges States and
