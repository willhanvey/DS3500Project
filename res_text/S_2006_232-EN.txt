Draft resolution

The Security Council,

Reaffirming all its previous resolutions and statements pertaining to the
situation between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and the requirements contained therein,
including in particular resolutions 1640 (2005) of 23 November 2005 and 1661
(2006) of 14 March 2006, as well as the statement of its President of 24 February
2006 (S/PRST/2006/10),

Stressing its unwavering commitment to the peace process, and to the full and
expeditious implementation of the Algiers Agreements,

Stressing further that lasting peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea (hereinafter
referred to as “the parties”) as well as in the region cannot be achieved without the
full demarcation of the border between the two parties, and recalling that both
parties have agreed to accept the determinations of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary
Commission (EEBC) as final and binding,

Reaffirming its strong commitment to ensure that the two parties permit the
United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) to perform its duties
without restrictions and provide UNMEE with the necessary access, assistance,
support and protection required for the performance of these duties, and in this
regard stressing that demarcation of the border cannot proceed unless UNMEE is
allowed full freedom of movement throughout its area of operations,

Welcoming once again the successful convening of the meeting of the
Witnesses to the Algiers Agreements on 22 February 2006 in New York, as well as
the convening of the EEBC meeting on 10 March 2006 in London and looking
forward to the next EEBC meeting,

Stressing that the unacceptable restrictions on UNMEE, which must be lifted,
have drastically reduced the operational capacity for the Mission and could lead to
serious implications for the Mission’s future,

Commending the role of UNMEE and expressing once again its deep
appreciation for the contribution and dedication of the troop-contributing countries
to the work of UNMEE, despite the immense difficulties which they are facing,

Mindful of the reports of the Secretary-General of 3 January 2006 (S/2006/1)
and of 6 March 2006 (S/2006/140) and the options on the future of UNMEE
contained therein,



2

S/2006/232

1. Decides to extend the mandate of UNMEE for a period of one month,
until 15 May 2006;

2. Demands that the parties fully comply with resolution 1640 (2005), in
particular paragraphs 1 and 5;

3. Calls on Member States to provide continued support for UNMEE and
contributions to the Trust Fund established pursuant to resolution 1177 (1998) and
referred to in article 4 (17) of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed by the
Governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea on 12 December 2000, in order to support the
demarcation process;

4. Affirms its intention, in the event it determines that the parties have not
demonstrated full compliance with resolution 1640 (2005) by the beginning of May
2006, to review the mandate and troop level of UNMEE by 15 May 2006, with a
view to a decision on possible adjustments of UNMEE, as outlined in the Secretary-
General’s report dated 3 January 2006 (S/2006/1), including inter alia a
transformation into an observer mission;

5. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
