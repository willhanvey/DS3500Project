 The Security Council,  

 Recalling its primary responsibility under the Charter of the United Nations 

for the maintenance of international peace and security, noting the significance of 

small arms and light weapons as the most frequently used weapons in the  majority 

of recent armed conflicts and emphasizing that the excessive accumulation and 

destabilizing effect of small arms and light weapons have a potential to endanger 

civilians, including women, children, refugees, internally displaced persons and

 Noting that this resolution focuses on the illicit transfer, destabilizing 

accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons, including in respect of 

Council-mandated arms embargoes,  

 Gravely concerned that the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and 

misuse of small arms and light weapons in many regions of the world continue to 

pose threats to international peace and security, cause significant loss of life, 

contribute to instability and insecurity and continue to undermine the effectiveness 

of the Security Council in discharging its primary responsibility for the maintenance 

of international peace and security,  

 Reiterating its deep regret that civilians continue to account for the vast 

majority of casualties in situations of armed conflict and recalling with grave 

concern that the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms 

and light weapons fuel armed conflicts and have a wide range of negative human 

rights, humanitarian, development and socioeconomic consequences, in particular 

on the security of civilians in armed conflict, including the disproportionate impact 

on violence perpetrated against women and girls and exacerbating sexual and 

gender-based violence,  

 Gravely concerned by the detrimental effects of the illicit transfer, 

destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons on children 

in armed conflict, in particular due to recruitment and use of children by parties to 

armed conflict, as well as their re-recruitment, killing and maiming, rape and other 

sexual violence, abductions, and attacks on schools and hospitals in violation of 

international law,  

 Recalling the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Additional Protocols of 

1977, and the obligation to respect and ensure respect for international humanitarian 

law in all circumstances,  

 Underlining the responsibility of States to prevent threats posed by the illicit 

transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons to 

international peace and security, and the devastating impact on civilians in a rmed 

conflict, and reaffirming that parties to armed conflict bear the primary 

responsibility to take all feasible steps to ensure the protection of civilians and 

recalling that States bear the primary responsibility to respect and ensure the human 

rights of all individuals within their territory and subject to their jurisdiction, as 

provided for by relevant international law,  

 Recognizing that the misuse of small arms and light weapons has resulted in 

grave crimes, expressing its strong opposition to impunity for serious violations of 

international humanitarian law and serious violations and abuses of human rights 

and emphasizing in this context the responsibility of States to comply with their 

relevant obligations to end impunity and to thoroughly investigate and prosecute 

persons responsible for war crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity or other 

serious violations of international humanitarian law is consistent with their 

obligations under international law,  

 Reaffirming the relevant provisions of the 2005 World Summit Outcome 

Document regarding the protection of civilians in armed conflict, including 

paragraphs 138 and 139 thereof regarding the responsibility to protect populations 

from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humani ty,  



 
S/2015/333 

 

3/9 15-08123 

 

 Recognizing that efforts by the United Nations aimed at addressing the illicit 

transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons 

should be a part of a comprehensive and integrated approach that incorporates and 

strengthens coherence between political, security, development, human rights and 

rule of law activities and addresses the root causes of conflict, strengthens 

community security and mitigates armed violence,  

 Recognizing that insecurity resulting from the illicit transfer, destabilizing 

accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons negatively impact 

conflict prevention, post-conflict peacebuilding, the consolidation of peace in 

countries emerging from conflict and their post-conflict development, including 

education, health and economic opportunity,  

 Acknowledging the important contribution of Council-mandated arms 

embargoes in countering the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse 

of small arms and light weapons, and noting the need to improve information 

sharing on possible arms embargo violations between groups of experts, 

peacekeeping missions within their mandates and other relevant United Nations 

entities,  

 Recognizing the desirability of aligning objectives of Council-mandated arms 

embargoes with the overall objectives of other efforts in the relevant Member State 

or region by United Nations entities, intergovernmental, regional and subregional 

organizations, including on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, 

improving physical security and stockpile management practices and enhancement 

of border security,  

 Reiterating that United Nations peacekeeping operations and other relevant 

Council-mandated entities, located in a Member State or region with a Council -

mandated arms embargo, may, if deemed necessary by the Council, assist with 

appropriate expertise and capacity-building for host governments in the field of 

weapons collection, disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration programmes, 

enhancing physical security and stockpile management practices, record keeping 

and tracing capacities, development of national export and import control systems, 

enhancement of border security, and strengthening judicial institutions and law 

enforcement capacity,  

 Recalling with concern the close connection between international terrorism, 

transnational organized crime, drugs trafficking, money-laundering, other illicit 

financial transactions, illicit brokering in small arms and light weapons and arms 

trafficking, and the link between the illegal exploitation of natural resources, illicit 

trade in such resources and the proliferation and trafficking of arms as a major 

factor fuelling and exacerbating many conflicts,  

 Emphasizing that the illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons can aid 

terrorism and illegal armed groups and facilitate increasing levels of transnational 

organized crime and underscoring that such illicit trafficking could harm civilians, 

including women and children, create instability and long-term governance 

challenges and complicate conflict resolution, 

 Stressing the utmost importance of women’s full and effective participation in 

all efforts related to countering the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and 

misuse of small arms and light weapons, in line with its resolution 1325 (2000),  



S/2015/333 
 

 

15-08123 4/9 

 

 Expressing concern at the continuing threats posed by the illicit transfer, 

destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons to the safety 

and security of United Nations peacekeepers and their effectiveness in 

implementing peacekeeping mandates, and to the safety and security of 

humanitarian workers and their effective provision of humanitarian assistance,  

 Recognizing the value of effective physical security and management of 

stockpiles of small arms, light weapons and ammunition as an important means to 

prevent the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and 

light weapons, in accordance with global and regional standards, including through 

the application of voluntary guidelines, such as the International Ammunition 

Technical Guidelines (IATG) developed under the UN SaferGuard programme, and 

the International Small Arms Control Standards (ISACS) in arms and ammunition 

stockpile management practices,  

 Noting that marking and tracing of small arms and light weapons by Member 

States, particularly countries in conflict and post-conflict situations, can serve to 

detect violations of applicable arms embargoes and identify weaknesses in stockpile 

management,  

 Acknowledging the entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty on 24 December 

2014, taking note of a great number of signatories to the Treaty and the increasing 

number of State Parties, and looking forward to the important contribution it can 

make to international peace, security and stability, reducing human suffering and 

promoting cooperation,  

 Reaffirming the significance and central role of the United Nations Convention 

against Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocols, including the Protocol 

against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and 

Components and Ammunition; the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and 

Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects; and 

the International Instrument to Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely and 

Reliable Manner, Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons, as crucial instruments in 

countering the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms 

and light weapons,  

 Noting with appreciation the efforts made by Member States, 

intergovernmental, regional and subregional organizations in addressing threats to 

international peace and security posed by the illicit transfer, destabilizing 

accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons, and noting the 

significant role of civil society in supporting such efforts,  

 Welcoming the Secretary-General’s report to the Council of 27 April 2015 

entitled “Small arms and light weapons” (S/2015/289),  

 Expressing its determination to implement existing and to take further 

practical steps to prevent the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse 

of small arms and light weapons, including in support of other ongoing processes,  

 1. Welcomes efforts made by Member States, regional and subregional 

organizations in addressing the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and 

misuse of small arms and light weapons, and encourages the establishment or 

strengthening, where appropriate, of subregional and regional cooperation, 

coordination and information sharing mechanisms, in particular, transborder

customs cooperation and networks for information-sharing, with a view to 

preventing, combating, and eradicating illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulatio n 

and misuse of small arms and light weapons;  

 2. Reiterates that the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse 

of small arms and light weapons fuel conflict and have devastating impact on the 

protection of civilians, reiterates its demand that all parties to armed conflict 

comply strictly with the obligations applicable to them under international 

humanitarian law, international human rights law and international refugee law, and 

stresses the need for parties to take all required measures to avoid civilian 

casualties, respect and protect the civilian population;  

 3. Reemphasizes its call on parties to armed conflict, in this regard, to 

comply with obligations under international humanitarian law to respect and protect 

humanitarian personnel, facilities and relief consignments, and to take measures to 

eradicate the negative impact of the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and 

misuse of small arms and light weapons on humanitarian actors, and to take all 

required steps to facilitate the safe, rapid and unimpeded passage of relief 

consignments, equipment and personnel;  

 4. Expresses its intention to continue to take due regard of issues related to 

the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light 

weapons when considering or updating mandates of United Nations peacekeeping 

operations and other Council-mandated entities, and in this regard encourages the 

Secretary-General, where appropriate, to consider identifying capacities of United 

Nations entities that could contribute to countering the illicit transfer, destabilizing 

accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons at the earliest possible 

stage, to consider involving these entities in strategic assessments and technical 

assessment missions and to present options for United Nations engagement in this 

regard, including through assisting host countries in weapons collection, 

disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration programmes, enhancing physical 

security and stockpile management practices, record keeping and tracing capacities, 

development of national export and import control systems, enhancement of border 

security, and strengthening judicial institutions and law enforcement capacity;   

 5. Emphasizes that Member States, United Nations peacekeeping operations 

and other Council-mandated entities, where appropriate and mandated, and 

intergovernmental, regional and subregional organizations, may be in a position to 

assist in capacity-building of governments upon request to ensure the safe and 

effective management, storage, security, marking, record-keeping and tracing of 

stockpiles of small arms and light weapons, and collection and/or destruction of 

surplus, seized, unmarked, or illicitly held weapons and ammunition and 

encourages Member States and intergovernmental, regional and subregional 

organizations in a position to do so to render assistance upon request in 

implementing these tasks, including through examining technologies that would 

improve the tracing and detection of illicit transfer in  small arms and light weapons, 

as well as measures to facilitate the transfer of such technologies;  

 6. Encourages the United Nations to gather and share best practices of 

Member States, related to safe storage, marking and destruction of weapons 

collected as part of weapons collection and disarmament, demobilization and 

reintegration programmes;  



S/2015/333 
 

 

15-08123 6/9 

 

 7. Recognizes that the effectiveness of weapons collection and 

disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes depends inter alia on 

providing sustainable opportunities to former combatants and on the ability of State 

institutions to foster an inclusive environment in which people feel safe and secure;  

 8. Emphasizes the importance of security sector reform in improving the 

ability of the State to extend public security and rule of law within its boundaries, to 

train professional, effective and accountable security personnel and assisting States 

to develop proper procedures for weapon stockpile management, physical security, 

marking, record-keeping and tracing;  

 9. Reaffirms its responsibility to monitor the implementation of Council-

mandated arms embargoes and reaffirms its intention to take appropriate measures, 

when needed, to strengthen arms embargo monitoring mechanisms including inter 

alia through assigning dedicated staff, monitoring units to relevant United Nations 

Missions to effectively monitor arms embargoes;  

 10. Recognizes the need for Member States to put in place, where they do 

not exist, adequate laws, regulations and administrative procedures to exercise 

effective control over the production of small arms and light weapons within their 

areas of jurisdiction and over the export, import, transit or retransfer of such 

weapons, in order to prevent illegal manufacture of and illicit trafficking in small 

arms and light weapons, or their diversion to unauthorized recipients;  

 11. Urges Member States, relevant United Nations entities, 

intergovernmental, regional and subregional organizations, in a position to do so 

and where appropriate, to cooperate and share information on suspected traffickers 

and trafficking routes, suspect financial transactions and brokering activities for, or 

diversions of, small arms or light weapons, and other information relevant to the 

illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation or misuse of small arms and light 

weapons, with potentially affected States and with relevant United Nations entities, 

including experts groups assisting sanctions committees and peacekeeping 

operations;  

 12. Urges Member States that have not yet done so to take measures, 

pursuant to their national laws, to regulate brokering taking place under their 

jurisdiction for small arms and light weapons, including measures that may require 

brokers to register or obtain written authorization before engaging in brokering; 

 13. Reiterates that Council-mandated arms embargoes should have clearly 

established objectives and provisions for regular review of the measures with a view 

to lifting them when the objectives are met, in accordance with the terms of the 

applicable Council resolutions, acknowledges that when considering a partial or 

complete termination, suspension or adjustment of an arms embargo the Council 

should, where applicable, take into account the capacities by the Member State 

subject to an arms embargo to, inter alia, apply physical security and stockpile 

management practices, implement marking, record keeping and tracing, develop 

national export and import control systems, enhance border security, and strengthen 

judicial institutions and law enforcement capacity and welcomes the conduct of 

assessment missions to evaluate progress by Member States subject to a Council -

mandated arms embargoes towards meeting the conditions set by the Council for 

their termination or adjustment and to provide options and recommendations 



 
S/2015/333 

 

7/9 15-08123 

 

regarding United Nations and other technical assistance to these Member States or 

their regions;  

 14. Notes that where Sanctions Committees are mandated to determine if an 

exemption to the arms embargo is justified, they could benefi t from information on 

the existing holdings including from the information on small arms and light 

weapons voluntarily provided to the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms, 

and self defence and security needs of arms and related materiel by the government, 

quantities of arms and related materiel received on the basis of previously approved 

exemptions, conditions of their storage, as well as quantities of arms and related 

materiel destroyed through disarmament, demobilization and reintegration 

programme, if applicable, and encourages Member States, Expert Groups and the 

Secretary-General to provide such information, if available and upon request by the 

relevant Sanctions Committee;  

 15. Encourages Sanctions Committees to maintain dialogue on 

implementation of arms embargoes with Member States, in particular those in the 

region, as well as international, regional and subregional organizations and other 

stakeholders including by inviting them to meet with the Committee and holding by 

the Chair of open briefings for all interested Member States; 

 16. Encourages Member States to better understand the impact of the illicit 

transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons on 

women and children, through, inter alia, strengthening the collection of data 

disaggregated by sex and age and developing appropriate and effective national risk 

assessment criteria;  

 17. Calls upon Member States, United Nations entities, intergovernmental, 

regional and subregional organizations to take into consideration the specific impact 

of conflict and post-conflict environments on women’s security, mobility, economic 

activity and opportunities, to mitigate the risk of women from becoming active 

players in the illicit transfer of small arms and light weapons;  

 18. Urges Member States, United Nations entities, intergovernmental, 

regional and subregional organizations, to take further measures to facilitate 

women’s full and meaningful participation in all policymaking, planning and 

implementation processes to combat and eradicate the illicit transfer, destabilizing 

accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons in all its aspects, and in 

that regard, encourages empowering women, including through capacity building 

efforts, as appropriate, to participate in the design and implementation of efforts 

related to the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms 

and light weapons, and calls upon all those involved in the planning for 

disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and justice and security sector 

reform efforts to take into account the particular needs of women and children 

associated with armed forces and armed groups, with the participation of women, 

and to provide for their full access to these programmes inter alia, through 

consultation with civil society, including women’s organizations, as appropriate;  

 19. Reaffirms its decision that States shall eliminate the supply of weapons, 

including small arms and light weapons, to terrorists, as well as its calls for Sta tes to 

find ways of intensifying and accelerating the exchange of operational information 

regarding trafficking in arms, and to enhance coordination of efforts on national, 

subregional, regional and international levels;  



S/2015/333 
 

 

15-08123 8/9 

 

 20. Recognizes the importance of preventing the illicit transfers and sales of 

weapons and ammunition, including small arms and light weapons, to armed groups 

and criminal networks that target civilians and civilian objects and underlines that 

such transfers could exacerbate conflict or facilitate the commitment of serious 

violations of international humanitarian law and serious violations and abuses of 

human rights; 

 21. Urges States to consider ratifying or acceding to the Arms Trade Treaty 

as soon as possible and encourages States, intergovernmental, regional and 

subregional organizations that are in a position to do so to render assistance in 

capacity-building to enable States Parties to fulfil and implement the Treaty ’s 

obligations;  

 22. Recognizes that improving national implementation of Council-mandated 

arms embargoes and mandating United Nations peacekeeping operations and other 

relevant Council-mandated entities to assist in building national and regional 

capacities by States, in particular related to transfer control systems, phys ical 

security and stockpile management, record-keeping and preventing diversion of 

small arms and light weapons and related materiel to illicit markets, may contribute 

to a more effective implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty by the States Parties;  

 23. Notes that implementation of national reporting provisions of the Arms 

Trade Treaty by the States Parties can contribute to increased transparency of small 

arms and light weapons transfers and could inform the United Nations activities 

related to countering the illicit transfer and destabilizing accumulation of small 

arms and light weapons;  

 24. Encourages all Member States that have not yet done so to consider 

acceding to and to implement the United Nations Convention against Transnational 

Organized Crime and its Protocols, including the Protocol against the Illicit 

Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and 

Ammunitions;  

 25. Stresses the need for full and effective implementation by States at the 

national, regional and international levels, of the United Nations Programme of 

Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light 

Weapons in All Its Aspects and the International Instrument to Enable States to 

Identify and Trace, in a Timely Manner, Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons, in 

particular, paying special attention to applying measures contained therein on the 

prevention of the diversion of small arms and light weapons, in order to make real 

progress in preventing, combating and eradicating the illicit trade in small arms and 

light weapons;  

 26. Requests the Secretary-General to include in his reports and briefings to 

the Council on country-specific situations, more comprehensive and detailed 

information and recommendations relating to the impact of the illicit transfer, 

destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons on the 

protection of civilians in armed conflict, including information specific to such 

impact on refugees, internally displaced persons, women, children and other 

vulnerable groups;  

 27. Requests the Secretary-General to include information and 

recommendations regarding the impact of the illicit transfer, destabilizing 

accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons on the protection of 



 
S/2015/333 

 

9/9 15-08123 

 

civilians in armed conflict as a sub-item in his next reports on the protection of 

civilians in armed conflict;  

 28. Reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to direct any relevant 

United Nations agencies operating in a State or region in relation to whic h the 

Council maintains an arms embargo provide the utmost assistance to the work of 

relevant sanctions committees, experts groups and other relevant United Nations 

entities in the implementation and compliance monitoring of that arms embargo, and 

requests the Secretary-General to examine and present, in his next report on small 

arms and light weapons, best practices and arrangements that could be used by the 

United Nations peacekeeping operations and other relevant Council -mandated 

entities to guide the implementation of their mandated tasks on the implementation 

and compliance monitoring of arms embargoes and the provision of assistance and 

expertise to host States, sanctions committees and experts groups;  

 29. Requests the Secretary-General to include in his annual reports on 

children and armed conflict as well as in his country-specific reports on children 

and armed conflict relevant information and recommendations regarding the impact 

of the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of sma ll arms and light 

weapons on children, to the extent consistent within the existing mandates;  

 30. Encourages the Committee established pursuant to resolutions 1267 

(1999) and 1989 (2011) and the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, 

within their existing mandates and in close cooperation with all relevant United
