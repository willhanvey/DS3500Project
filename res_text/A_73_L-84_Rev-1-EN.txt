Senegal:* revised draft resolution  
 

 

  Advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the legal 

consequences of the separation of the Chagos Archipelago from 

Mauritius in 1965  
 

 

 The General Assembly,  

 Guided by the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, 

including the inalienable right of self-determination of peoples, 

 Considering that respect for the obligations arising from the Charter and other 

instruments and rules of international law is among the basic purposes and principles 

of the United Nations, 

 Recalling its resolution 71/292 of 22 June 2017, by which it decided, in 

accordance with Article 96 of the Charter, to request the International Court of Justice, 

pursuant to Article 65 of the Statute of the Court, to render an advisory opinion on 

the following two questions relating to the legal consequences of the separation of 

the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965:  

 (a) “Was the process of decolonization of Mauritius lawfully completed when 

Mauritius was granted independence in 1968, following the separation of the Chagos 

Archipelago from Mauritius and having regard to international law, including 

obligations reflected in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 

1960, 2066 (XX) of 16 December 1965, 2232 (XXI) of 20 December 1966 and 2357 

(XXII) of 19 December 1967?”,  

 (b) “What are the consequences under international law, including obligations 

reflected in the above-mentioned resolutions, arising from the continued 

administration by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of the 

Chagos Archipelago, including with respect to the inability of Mauritius to implement 

a programme for the resettlement on the Chagos Archipelago of its nationals, in 

particular those of Chagossian origin?”, 

 

 * On behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the Group of 

African States.

19-08177 2/3 

 

 Having received the advisory opinion of the Court, rendered on 25 February 

2019,1 in which the Court found that: 

 (a) “The process of decolonization of Mauritius was not lawfully completed 

when that country acceded to independence in 1968, following the separation of the 

Chagos Archipelago”,  

 (b) “The United Kingdom is under an obligation to bring to an end its 

administration of the Chagos Archipelago as rapidly as possible”,  

 (c) “All Member States are under an obligation to co-operate with the United 

Nations in order to complete the decolonization of Mauritius”,  

 (d) “As regards the resettlement on the Chagos Archipelago of Mauritian 

nationals, including those of Chagossian origin, this is an issue relating to the 

protection of the human rights of those concerned, which should be addressed by the 

General Assembly during the completion of the decolonization of Mauritius”,  

 Considering that respect for the Court and its functions, including in the exercise 

of its advisory jurisdiction, is essential to international law and justice and to an 

international order based on the rule of law,  

 Reaffirming the responsibility of the United Nations, in accordance with 

resolution 1514 (XV), to assist in the process of decolonization of Mauritius,  

 1. Welcomes the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 

25 February 2019 on the legal consequences of the separation of the Chagos 

Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965;1  

 2. Affirms, in accordance with the advisory opinion of the Court, that:  

 (a) Because the detachment of the Chagos Archipelago was not based on the 

free and genuine expression of the will of the people of Mauritius, the decolonization 

of Mauritius has not been lawfully completed;  

 (b) The Chagos Archipelago forms an integral part of the territory of 

Mauritius;  

 (c) Since the decolonization of Mauritius was not conducted in a manner 

consistent with the right of peoples to self-determination, it follows that the continued 

administration of the Chagos Archipelago by the United Kingdom of Great Britain 

and Northern Ireland constitutes a wrongful act entailing the international 

responsibility of that State;  

 (d) the United Kingdom is under an obligation to bring to an end its 

administration of the Chagos Archipelago as rapidly as possible;  

 (e) Since respect for the right to self-determination is an obligation erga 

omnes, all States have a legal interest in protecting that right and all Member States 

are under an obligation to cooperate with the United Nations in order to complete the 

decolonization of Mauritius;  

 (f) The resettlement of Mauritian nationals, including those of Chagossian 

origin, must be addressed as a matter of urgency during the completion of the 

decolonization process; 

 3. Demands that the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 

withdraw its colonial administration from the Chagos Archipelago unconditionally 

within a period of no more than six months from the adoption of the present

resolution, thereby enabling Mauritius to complete the decolonization of its territory 

as rapidly as possible; 

 4. Urges the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to 

cooperate with Mauritius in facilitating the resettlement of Mauritian nationals, 

including those of Chagossian origin, in the Chagos Archipelago, and to pose no 

impediment or obstacle to such resettlement;  

 5. Calls upon all Member States to cooperate with the United Nations to 

ensure the completion of the decolonization of Mauritius as rapidly as possible, and 

to refrain from any action that will impede or delay the completion of the process of 

decolonization of Mauritius in accordance with the advisory opinion of the 

International Court of Justice and the present resolution;  

 6. Calls upon the United Nations and all its specialized agencies to recognize 

that the Chagos Archipelago forms an integral part of the territory of Mauritius, to 

support the decolonization of Mauritius as rapidly as possible, and to refrain from 

impeding that process by recognizing, or giving effect to any measure taken by or on 

behalf of, the “British Indian Ocean Territory”; 

 7. Calls upon all other international, regional and intergovernmental 

organizations, including those established by treaty, to recognize that the Chagos 

Archipelago forms an integral part of the territory of Mauritius, to support the 

decolonization of Mauritius as rapidly as possible, and to refrain from impeding that 

process by recognizing, or giving effect to any measure taken by or on behalf of, the 

“British Indian Ocean Territory”; 

 8. Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report to the General Assembly 

at its seventy-fourth session on the implementation of the present resolution, 

including any actions taken by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 

Ireland and other Member States.
