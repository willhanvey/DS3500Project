 Aware of the continuing needs of the Palestine refugees throughout all the 
fields of operation, namely, Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic and the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory,  

 Expressing grave concern at the especially difficult situation of the Palestine 
refugees under occupation, including with regard to their safety, well-being and 
socio-economic living conditions,  

 Expressing grave concern in particular at the critical humanitarian situation 
and socio-economic conditions of the Palestine refugees in the Gaza Strip, and 
underlining the importance of emergency and humanitarian assistance and urgent 
reconstruction efforts,  

 Noting the signing of the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-
Government Arrangements2 on 13 September 1993 by the Government of Israel and 
the Palestine Liberation Organization and the subsequent implementation 
agreements,  

 1. Notes with regret that repatriation or compensation of the refugees, as 
provided for in paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), has not yet 
been effected, and that, therefore, the situation of the Palestine refugees continues to 
be a matter of grave concern and the Palestine refugees continue to require 
assistance to meet basic health, education and living needs;  

 2. Also notes with regret that the United Nations Conciliation Commission 
for Palestine has been unable to find a means of achieving progress in the 
implementation of paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), and 
reiterates its request to the Conciliation Commission to continue exerting efforts 
towards the implementation of that paragraph and to report to the Assembly as 
appropriate, but no later than 1 September 2010;  

 3. Affirms the necessity for the continuation of the work of the United 
Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and the 
importance of its unimpeded operation and its provision of services for the well-
being and human development of the Palestine refugees and for the stability of the 
region, pending the just resolution of the question of the Palestine refugees;  

 4. Calls upon all donors to continue to make the most generous efforts 
possible to meet the anticipated needs of the United Nations Relief and Works 
Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, including with regard to increased 
expenditures arising from the continuing deterioration of the socio-economic and 
humanitarian situation in the region, particularly in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, and those mentioned in recent emergency appeals; 

 5. Commends the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine 
Refugees in the Near East for its provision of vital assistance to the Palestine 
refugees and its role as a stabilizing factor in the region and the tireless efforts of 
the staff of the Agency in carrying out its mandate, and welcomes in this regard the 
high-level event of the General Assembly commemorating the sixtieth anniversary 
of the establishment of the Agency, on 24 September 2009.
