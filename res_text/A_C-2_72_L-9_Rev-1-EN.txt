17-20807 4/8 

 

 Deeply concerned by the fact that many commodity-dependent developing 

countries continue to be highly vulnerable to price fluctuations, and recognizing the 

need to continue efforts to diversify economies, as well as to improve the 

regulation, where appropriate, and the efficiency, responsiveness, functioning and 

transparency of financial and commodity markets nationally, regionally and 

internationally in order to address excessive commodity price volatility,  

 Expressing concern that the global economy has yet to recover completely and 

remains in a challenging phase, notwithstanding the recent cyclical pickup in global 

economic activity, that growth remains weak in many countries and includes 

subdued trade growth, volatile capital flows, widespread fiscal strains and 

unsustainable debt in some countries, particularly developing countries, and that 

commodity exporters are particularly hard hit owing to their continued adjustment 

to a sharp step-down in foreign earnings, recognizing that, while short-term risks 

are broadly balanced, medium-term risks are still tilted to the downside, and in this 

regard stressing the need for continuing efforts to address systemic fragilities and 

imbalances, to reform and strengthen the international financial system and to make 

further progress towards sustaining and rebalancing global demand,   

 Recognizing the adverse impact of excessive price volatility of commodities, 

especially on women, girls and young people,  

 Recognizing also that the structural constraints that women face as economic 

agents, including segmentation in low-value-added or subsistence-oriented work, 

unequal access to productive resources, limited access to training and skill -building 

due to gender segmentation in education and labour markets and a lack of resources, 

as well as the heavy burden of unpaid work, make women and girls especially 

vulnerable to the adverse impact of excessive price volatility of commodities,  

 Recognizing further that many developing countries continue to be highly 

dependent on primary commodities as their principal source of export revenues, 

employment, income generation and domestic savings and require additional 

sources of growth to become the driving force of investment, economic growth and 

social development, including poverty eradication, recognizing also the challenges 

and special needs of those countries, and stressing the critical importance of 

sustainable and inclusive industrial development for developing countries as a 

critical source of economic growth, economic diversification and value addition,  

 Recognizing that uncertainty in global commodity markets reinforces the need 

to comprehensively deal with the commodity problematique, inter alia, the demand 

for commodities, supply capacities, commodity revenues and investments in 

commodity-dependent economies, while taking due account of the diversity of each  

country’s individual situation and needs and the promotion of their sustainable 

development, and to strengthen the nexus between, inter alia, trade, finance, 

investment in sustainable agriculture and food systems, energy and industrialization,  

 Noting the work on consensus-building on commodity-related issues achieved 

through meetings of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 

including the multi-year expert meetings on commodities and development, the 

Global Commodities Forum and the African Oil, Gas and Mines Trade and Finance 

Conference and Exhibition,  

 Recognizing the adverse impact of excessive price volatility of commodities 

on both producer and consumer countries, particularly commodity -dependent 

developing countries,  

 Noting the recent and marked reversal in commodity prices and that 

commodity net export economies may need to adjust to a possibly protracted period 

of lower export and fiscal revenues,  



 
A/C.2/72/L.9/Rev.1 

 

5/8 17-20807 

 

 Noting also the volatility and unpredictability of commodity prices, which 

have threatened, inter alia, the food security of net importers in the recent past, and 

noting further that the continuation of this long -term uncertainty and volatility, 

intensified by recent trends in commodity prices, can have an impact on the 

capacities of many developing countries, particularly commodity-dependent 

countries, to continue to implement policies for achieving sustainable development 

and poverty eradication,  

 Stressing the importance of policies to address longer-term structural issues, 

including structural constraints faced by women as economic agents, to diversify 

commodity economies and to integrate commodity policies into wider development 

and poverty eradication strategies at all levels,  

 Noting all relevant voluntary initiatives aimed at improving transparency in 

commodity markets and mitigating the impact of excessive price volatility,  

 Underlining the importance of timely, accurate and transparent information in 

helping to address excessive food price volatility, noting global and regio nal 

initiatives, including the Agricultural Market Information System and its Rapid 

Response Forum, the joint organization data initiative and other regional data 

platforms and programmes, and urging the participating international organizations, 

private sector actors and Governments to ensure the public dissemination of timely 

and quality food market information products,  

 Expressing deep concern at the adverse impact of climate change and extreme 

weather patterns on access to, and the utilization and prices of, agricultural 

commodities,  

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on world commodity 

trends and prospects;
16

  

 2. Recognizes the interlinkage between the adequate and transparent 

functioning of commodity markets and the capacity of some commodity -dependent 

developing countries to collect appropriate fiscal revenues from commodity exports 

and mobilize domestic sources to support their sustainable development, mainly 

through sustainable and inclusive economic growth, industrialization, decent work 

and market diversification;  

 3. Encourages support for developing countries, according to their national 

plans and policies, through technical assistance, to increase their capacity in detecting 

and averting trade mispricing in their commodities sectors in order to enhance their 

benefits from those sectors to support sustainable growth and development;  

 4. Reiterates the need for further efforts to address excessive commodity 

price volatility, in particular by assisting producers, especially small -scale producers, 

including women, in accordance with national plans and policies, in managing risk;   

 5. Calls upon the international community to support the efforts of 

commodity-dependent developing countries to address the factors that create 

structural barriers to international trade and impede, inter alia, diversification, 

including tariff and non-tariff barriers, limited access to financial services resulting 

in scarce resources for investing in the commodity sector, weak infrastructure, 

particularly regarding both the cost and availability of transportation and storage, 

and lack of skills in producing and marketing alternative products;  

 6. Looks forward to the convening of the Eleventh Ministerial Conference 

of the World Trade Organization in Buenos Aires from 10 to 13 December 2017;

17-20807 6/8 

 

 7. Notes with concern the slow and uneven recovery from the severe 

economic and financial crisis of 2008, despite the recent strengthening of global 

economic activity, since growth remains weak in many countries and agricultural 

and other commodity prices remain depressed while inequalities are rising, and 

acknowledges that international trade can play a role in achieving sustainable, 

robust and balanced growth for all;  

 8. Calls for a coherent set of policy actions at the national, regional and 

international levels to address excessive price volatility and support commodity -

dependent developing countries in mitigating negative impacts, in particular by 

facilitating value addition and enhancing their participation in commodity and 

related product value chains, by supporting large-scale diversification of these 

economies and by encouraging the use and further development of market-oriented 

risk management tools, instruments and strategies;  

 9. Stresses the importance of developing and strengthening agricultural 

policies and strategies that recognize and address women’s critical role in food 

security and improved nutrition outcomes as an integral part of both short - and 

long-term responses to food insecurity and malnutrition, excessive price volatility 

and food crises in developing countries;  

 10. Recognizes the potential for innovation, productivity improvements and 

the promotion of non-traditional exports in most commodity-dependent developing 

countries, particularly in Africa, and calls for enhanced support by the international 

community as well as exchanges of experience in these areas within the framework 

of South-South economic cooperation;  

 11. Underscores the importance of increased investments in quality, reliable, 

sustainable and resilient infrastructure as a means of promoting agricultural 

development and enhancing commodity diversification, including value-added 

production, and trade, and urges the international community to assist commodity -

dependent developing countries to mainstream trade as well as sound investment 

and financial policies as key elements of development strategies, based on national 

circumstances and development priorities, and to invest in and support research and 

development of agriculture productivity;  

 12. Recognizes the endorsement of the Voluntary Guidelines on the 

Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of 

National Food Security
17

 by the Committee on World Food Security in 2012;  

 13. Also recognizes the endorsement of the Principles for Responsible 

Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems
18

 by the Committee on World Food 

Security in 2014;  

 14. Stresses that technical assistance and capacity-building aimed at 

improving the commodity export competitiveness of producers are particularly 

important for developing countries, especially in Africa, and invites Member S tates 

and all relevant stakeholders to provide the necessary resources for commodity -

specific financial and technical assistance, in particular for human and institutional 

capacity-building, including gender-responsive measures, as well as quality, 

reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure development of developing 

countries, with a view to reducing their institutional bottlenecks and transaction 

costs and enhancing their commodity trade and development in accordance with 

national development plans;

 15. Also stresses that the Aid for Trade initiative should aim to help 

developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, to build the supply -

side capacity and trade-related infrastructure that they need to assist them to 

implement and benefit from World Trade Organization agreements and, more 

broadly, to expand their trade;  

 16. Recalls the agreement to keep under regular review, by the Ministerial 

Conference and appropriate organs of the World Trade Organization, the impact of 

the results of the Uruguay Round on the least developed countries as well as on the 

net food-importing developing countries, with a view to fostering positive measures 

to enable them to achieve their development objectives, and in this regard calls for 

the implementation of the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures Concerning 

the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least Developed and 

Net Food-Importing Developing Countries;  

 17. Encourages developed countries that have not already done so and 

developing countries declaring themselves in a position to do so to take steps 

towards the goal of realizing timely implementation of duty -free and quota-free 

market access on a lasting basis for all least developed countries, consistent with the 

Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration adopted by the World Trade Organization in 

2005;  

 18. Strongly encourages international financial institutions and development 

banks to assist developing countries, in particular commodity -dependent developing 

countries, in managing the effects of excessive price volatility;  

 19. Reaffirms that every State has and shall freely exercise full permanent 

sovereignty over all its wealth, natural resources and economic activities;  

 20. Recognizes the importance of increasing efficiency, effectiveness and 

transparency in the management of public and private sector revenues in developed 

and developing countries derived from all commodities and commodities -related 

industries, including final processed goods, in support of development;  

 21. Notes the important contributions of the Common Fund for Commodities 

and other international commodities organizations, and encourages them, in 

cooperation with the International Trade Centre, the United Nations Conference on 

Trade and Development, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization 

and other relevant bodies, to strengthen coordination among them and to identify 

and implement innovative measures to enable the sustainable contribution of the 

commodity sector to economic development, including ways to reduce vulnerability 

to volatility in commodities, as well as to enhance activities in developing countries 

to improve access to markets and the reliability of supply, enhance diversification 

and the addition of value, improve the competitiveness of commodities, strengthen 

the market chain, improve market structures, broaden the export base and ensure the 

effective participation of all stakeholders, on the basis of a shared understanding of 

the contribution of commodities to sustainable development;  

 22. Stresses that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 

and its partners, in the spirit of inter-agency cooperation and multi-stakeholder 

partnerships, within their respective mandates, should continue to engage actively in 

collaborative research and analysis of the commodity problematique and related 

capacity- and consensus-building activities, with a view to providing regular 

analysis and policy advice relevant to the sustainable development of commodity -

dependent developing countries, particularly low-income countries;  

 23. Emphasizes the importance of facilitating accession to the World Trade 

Organization, particularly for commodity-dependent developing countries, in full 

compliance with its rules;  



A/C.2/72/L.9/Rev.1 
 

 

17-20807 8/8 

 

 24. Underlines the urgent need for the provision of and access to trade 

finance to commodity-dependent developing countries, given the tightened access to 

all types of credit and noting debt sustainability;  

 25. Welcomes the commitment to redouble efforts to substantially reduce 

illicit financial flows by 2030, with a view to eventually eliminating them;   

 26. Stresses that revenues from commodity production and exports remain 

critical for developing countries, in particular in the context of the implementation 

of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, given that developing countries 

need to mobilize resources in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, 

and that commodity prices have been decreasing since 2011, which has put pressure 

on government budgets in developing countries, notes with concern the fall in 

commodity prices despite their increase last year, and recognizes with concern that 

African countries, the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries 

and small island developing States face particular challenges as lower commodity 

prices threaten the sustainable growth and the debt positions of such countries and 

therefore calls upon these Member States to diversify their economies in order to 

achieve economic growth and the Sustainable Development Goals;  

 27. Decides to hold a one-off one-day informal interactive dialogue of the 

General Assembly on commodity markets during the first half of 2019 to review 

world commodity trends and prospects, particularly in commodity -dependent 

countries, on a date and in a format to be decided by the President of the General 

Assembly;  

 28. Calls upon all relevant bodies, agencies, funds and programmes of the 

United Nations system and other relevant intergovernmental, global, regional and 

subregional organizations, in particular the United Nations Conference on Trade and 

Development and all relevant international financial and economic institutions, 

within their respective mandates, to continue to address the issue of the low 

industrialization and diversification of the economies of some commodity-

dependent developing countries in relation to the capacity of Member States to 

achieve all the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030;
