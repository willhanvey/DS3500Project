  Reducing nuclear danger 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Bearing in mind that the use of nuclear weapons poses the most serious threat 
to mankind and to the survival of civilization, 

 Reaffirming that any use or threat of use of nuclear weapons would constitute a 
violation of the Charter of the United Nations, 

 Convinced that the proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects would 
seriously enhance the danger of nuclear war, 

 Convinced also that nuclear disarmament and the complete elimination of 
nuclear weapons are essential to remove the danger of nuclear war, 

 Considering that, until nuclear weapons cease to exist, it is imperative on the 
part of the nuclear-weapon States to adopt measures that assure non-nuclear-weapon 
States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, 

 Considering also that the hair-trigger alert of nuclear weapons carries 
unacceptable risks of unintentional or accidental use of nuclear weapons, which 
would have catastrophic consequences for all mankind, 

 Emphasizing the imperative need to adopt measures to avoid accidental, 
unauthorized or unexplained incidents arising from computer anomaly or other 
technical malfunctions, 

 Conscious that limited steps relating to de-alerting and de-targeting have been 
taken by the nuclear-weapon States and that further practical, realistic and mutually 
reinforcing steps are necessary to contribute to the improvement in the international 
climate for negotiations leading to the elimination of nuclear weapons, 



A/C.1/61/L.49  
 

06-56810 2 
 

 Mindful that a diminishing role for nuclear weapons in the security policies of 
nuclear-weapon States would positively impact on international peace and security 
and improve the conditions for the further reduction and the elimination of nuclear 
weapons, 

 Reiterating the highest priority accorded to nuclear disarmament in the Final 
Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly1 and by the 
international community, 

 Recalling that in the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on 
the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons,2 it is stated that there exists 
an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion 
negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and 
effective international control, 

 Recalling also the call in the United Nations Millennium Declaration3 to seek 
to eliminate the dangers posed by weapons of mass destruction and the resolve to 
strive for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear 
weapons, including the possibility of convening an international conference to 
identify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers, 

 1. Calls for a review of nuclear doctrines and, in this context, immediate 
and urgent steps to reduce the risks of unintentional and accidental use of nuclear 
weapons, including through de-alerting and de-targeting of nuclear weapons; 

 2.  Requests the five nuclear-weapon States to take measures towards the 
implementation of paragraph 1 above; 

 3.  Calls upon Member States to take the necessary measures to prevent the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects and to promote nuclear 
disarmament, with the objective of eliminating nuclear weapons; 

 4.  Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General submitted pursuant to 
paragraph 5 of General Assembly resolution 60/79 of 8 December 2005;4 

 5.  Requests the Secretary-General to intensify efforts and support initiatives 
that would contribute towards the full implementation of the seven 
recommendations identified in the report of the Advisory Board on Disarmament 
Matters that would significantly reduce the risk of nuclear war,5 and also to 
continue to encourage Member States to endeavour to create conditions that would 
allow the emergence of an international consensus to hold an international 
conference as proposed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration,3 to identify 
ways of eliminating nuclear dangers, and to report thereon to the General Assembly 
at its sixty-second session; 

 6.  Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-second session 
the item entitled “Reducing nuclear danger”.
