 Noting the constructive debates that the Conference on Disarmament has held 

on this subject and the views expressed by Member States,  

 Recalling the introduction by China and the Russian Federation at the 

Conference on Disarmament of the draft treaty on prevention of the placement of 

weapons in outer space and of the threat or use of force against outer space objects, 2 

and the submission of its updated version3 in 2014, 

 Noting that, since 2004, several States4 have introduced a policy of not being 

the first State to place weapons in outer space,  

 Expressing regret that, due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic 

and unresolved organizational problems within the Disarmament Commission, its 

working group tasked with preparing recommendations relating to the practical 

implementation of transparency and confidence-building measures in outer space 

activities with the goal of preventing an arms race in outer space was not in a position 

to conduct its work, and stressing the importance of resuming its deliberations,  

 Recognizing that the work within the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer 

Space, its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee and its Legal Subcommittee, 

including the promotion of the long-term sustainability of outer space activities, has 

a fundamental role to play in enhancing transparency and confidence-building among 

States and in ensuring that outer space is maintained for peaceful purposes,  

 Noting the contribution of Member States that have submitted to the Secretary-

General concrete proposals on international outer space transparency and confidence -

building measures pursuant to paragraph 1 of resolution 61/75, paragraph 2 of 

resolution 62/43, paragraph 2 of resolution 63/68 and paragraph 2 of resolution 64/49, 

 Recalling the work done in 2012 and 2013 by the Group of Governmental 

Experts on Transparency and Confidence-building Measures in Outer Space 

Activities, which was convened by the Secretary-General, on the basis of equitable 

geographical distribution, to conduct a study on outer space transparen cy and 

confidence-building measures, 

 Recalling also the consideration of the report of the Group of Governmental 

Experts,5 as well as views on the modalities of making practical use of the 

recommendations contained therein, as set out in the report of the Committee on the 

Peaceful Uses of Outer Space on its fifty-eighth session, held in 2015,6 at which it 

found that the Committee had a fundamental role to play in enhancing transparency 

and confidence-building among States, as well as in ensuring that outer space is 

maintained for peaceful purposes,  

 Recalling further that, in its report, the Group of Governmental Experts had 

recognized the value of the work of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer 

Space in developing a set of voluntary, non-legally binding guidelines for the long-

term sustainability of outer space activities, some of which could be considered as 

potential transparency and confidence-building measures, while others could enhance 

the safety of outer space activities and thereby provide the technical basis for the 

further implementation of additional transparency and confidence-building measures,
