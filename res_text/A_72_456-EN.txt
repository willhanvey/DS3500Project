  Draft resolution II  

  Question of American Samoa  
 

 

 The General Assembly,  

 Having considered the question of American Samoa and examined the relevant 

chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the 

Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial 

Countries and Peoples for 2017,
1
 

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on American 

Samoa
2
 and other relevant information,  

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory 

are valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the 

people of American Samoa and in conformity with the clearly defined principles 

contained in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 

1541 (XV) of 15 December 1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,  

 Expressing concern that 57 years after the adoption of the Declaration on the 

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples,
3
 there still remain 

17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including American Samoa,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2020 and the plans of action for the Second
4
 and Third International 

Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism,  

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people 

of American Samoa require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the 

options for self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical 

location, size of population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and tha t 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  

 Acknowledging the outcome of the referendum held on 4 November 2014, in 

which the proposal to give the Fono, the Territory’s legislature, the authority to 

override the Governor’s veto was rejected, and welcoming the discussion opened in 

the Territory as to the way forward,  

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the 

Non-Self-Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the 

use of the Territories as tax havens to the detriment of the world economy and by 

the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that are 

contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the 

Territory, under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that

the views of the people of American Samoa in respect of their right to 

self-determination should be ascertained,  

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the 

local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional 

organizations,  

 Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding 

of the political status of the people of American Samoa and to fulfil its mandate 

effectively, it is important for it to be apprised by the United States of America as 

the administering Power and to receive information from other appropriate sources, 

including the representatives of the Territory, concerning the wishes and aspirat ions 

of the people of the Territory,  

 Aware of the importance both to American Samoa and to the Special 

Committee of the participation of elected and appointed representatives of American 

Samoa in the work of the Committee,  

 Recognizing the need for the Special Committee to ensure that the appropriate 

bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at 

assisting the people of American Samoa with their inalienable right to self -

determination and in gaining a better understanding of the options for self-

determination, on a case-by-case basis,  

 Mindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the 

Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 

representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 

the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the 

seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial 

element in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political 

status of the Territories,  

 Welcoming the Caribbean regional seminar on the theme “Implementation of 

the Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism: the future for 

decolonization in the Non-Self-Governing Territories — what are the prospects?”, 

held by the Special Committee in Kingstown and hosted by the Government of Saint 

Vincent and the Grenadines from 16 to 18 May 2017, as a significant and forward -

looking event, which enabled the participants to assess progress made and address 

challenges faced in the decolonization process, review the existing working methods 

of the Committee and renew its commitment to implementing its historic task,  

 Recognizing the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted 

by the seminar, which are annexed to the report of the Special Committee
5
 and 

which outline the findings of the seminar, including, especially, the way forward for 

the decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General 

Assembly of the period 2011–2020 as the Third International Decade for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,
6
 

 Noting with appreciation the contribution to the development of some 

Territories by the specialized agencies and other organizations of the Unit ed Nations 

system, in particular the Economic Commission for Latin America and the 

Caribbean, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the 

United Nations Development Programme and the World Food Programme, as well 

as regional institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean 

Community, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, the Pacific Islands 

Forum and the agencies of the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific,

 Noting the statement made by a representative of the Governor of American 

Samoa at the 2017 Caribbean regional seminar,
7
 

 Noting also the statement made by a representative of the Governor of 

American Samoa at the 2017 Caribbean regional seminar that some constitutional 

rights of the administering Power were not extended to American Samoa and that 

elected leaders of the Territory had opposed the granting of birthright citizenship to 

the people of American Samoa on the basis that a constitutional interpretation which 

would allow outsiders an equal right to own land might undermine and eventually 

destroy Samoan culture,  

 Noting further the statement made by a representative of the Governor of 

American Samoa at the 2017 Caribbean regional seminar that, without a flexible 

and innovative approach, prospects for decolonization in American Samoa were 

limited,  

 Aware of the work of the Future Political Status Study Commission, completed 

in 2006, the release of its report, with recommendations, in January 2007 and the 

creation of the American Samoa Constitutional Review Committee, as well as the 

holding in June 2010 of the Territory’s fourth Constitutional Convention,  

 Taking note of the decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the 

District of Columbia Circuit, issued on 5 June and 2 October 2015, affirming the 

judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which 

dismissed a lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that would have asserted that 

the citizenship clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of th e 

United States extended to American Samoa, and taking note also of the decision by 

the Supreme Court of the United States on 13 June 2016 which denied the petition 

for a writ of certiorari submitted on 1 February 2016,  

 Recalling the indication by the territorial Government, including at the 2015 

Caribbean regional seminar, that certain federal laws have had and continue to have 

a debilitating impact on the Territory’s ability to achieve sustainable economic 

growth, 

 Noting the general election in the Territory which took place in November 

2016,
8
 

 1. Reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of American Samoa to self -

determination, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and with 

General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), containing the Declaration on the Granting 

of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples;  

 2. Also reaffirms that, in the process of the decolonization of American 

Samoa, there is no alternative to the principle of self-determination, which is also a 

fundamental human right, as recognized under the relevant human rights 

conventions;  

 3. Further reaffirms that it is ultimately for the people of American Samoa 

to determine freely their future political status in accordance with the relevant 

provisions of the Charter, the Declaration and the relevant resolutions of the General 

Assembly, and in that connection calls upon the administering Power, in cooperation 

with the territorial Government and appropriate bodies of the United Nations 

system, to develop political education programmes for the Territory in order to 

foster an awareness among the people of their right to self-determination in

 4. Takes note of the work of the territorial Government with respect to

Countries and Peoples, until such time as its people have exercised their right to 

self-determination;  

 6. Also recalls the invitation extended in 2015 by the Governor of American 

Samoa to the Special Committee to send a visiting mission to the Territory, calls 

upon the administering Power to facilitate such a mission if the territorial 

Government so desires, and requests the Chair of the Special Committee to take all 

the steps necessary to that end;  

 7. Requests the administering Power to assist the Territory by facilitating its 

work concerning a public awareness programme, consistent with Article 73 b of the

provide assistance to the Territory, if requested;  

 8. Stresses the importance of the Special Committee being apprised of the 

views and wishes of the people of American Samoa and enhancing its understanding 

of their conditions, including the nature and scope of the existing political and 

constitutional arrangements between American Samoa and the administering Power;  

 9. Calls upon the administering Power to participate in and cooperate fully 

with the work of the Special Committee in order to implement the provisions of

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on Bermuda

Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of 15 December

3
 there still remain  

17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including Bermuda, 

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the

4
 and Third International 

Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism,

contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the 

Territory, under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case -by-case basis, and that 

the views of the people of the Cayman Islands in respect of their right to self-

  Question of Guam 
 

 

 The General Assembly,  

 Having considered the question of Guam and examined the relevant chapter of 

the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the 

Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial 

Countries and Peoples for 2017,
1
  

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on Guam
2
 and 

other relevant information,  

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory 

are valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the 

people of Guam and in conformity with the clearly defined principles contained in 

General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of 

15 December 1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,  

 Expressing concern that 57 years after the adoption of the Declaration on the 

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples,
3
 there still remain 

17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including Guam,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2020 and the plans of action for the Second
4
 and Third International 

Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism,  

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people 

of Guam require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the options for 

self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical location, 

size of population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the 

Non-Self-Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the 

use of the Territories as tax havens to the detriment of the world economy and by 

the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that are 

contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the 

Territory, under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case -by-case basis, and that 

the views of the people of Guam in respect of their right to self -determination 

should be ascertained,  

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the 

local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional 

organizations,

 Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding 

of the political status of the people of Guam and to fulfil its mandate effectively, it 

is important for it to be apprised by the United States of America as the 

administering Power and to receive information from other appropriate sources, 

including the representatives of the Territory, concerning the wishes and aspirations 

of the people of the Territory,  

 Aware of the importance both to Guam and to the Special Committee of the 

participation of elected and appointed representatives of Guam in the work of the 

Committee,  

 Recognizing the need for the Special Committee to ensure that the appropriate 

bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at 

assisting the people of Guam with their inalienable right to self -determination and 

in gaining a better understanding of the options for self-determination, on a case-by-

case basis,  

 Mindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the 

Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participat ion of 

representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 

the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the 

seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial 

element in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political 

status of the Territories,  

 Welcoming the Caribbean regional seminar on the theme “Implementation of 

the Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism: the future  for 

decolonization in the Non-Self-Governing Territories — what are the prospects?”, 

held by the Special Committee in Kingstown and hosted by the Government of Saint 

Vincent and the Grenadines from 16 to 18 May 2017, as a significant and forward -

looking event, which enabled the participants to assess progress made and address 

challenges faced in the decolonization process, review the existing working methods 

of the Committee and renew its commitment to implementing its historic task,  

 Recognizing the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted 

by the seminar, which are annexed to the report of the Special Committee
5
 and 

which outline the findings of the seminar, including, especially, the way forward for 

the decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General

Eradication of Colonialism,
6
  

 Noting with appreciation the contribution to the development of some 

Territories by the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations 

system, in particular the Economic Commission for Latin America and the 

Caribbean, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the 

United Nations Development Programme and the World Food Programme, as well 

as regional institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean 

Community, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, the Pacific Islands 

Forum and the agencies of the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific,  

 Noting the statement made by a representative of the Governor of Guam at the 

2017 Caribbean regional seminar, at which participants received updates on the 

financial and non-financial challenges faced by the Territory and the efforts towards

Determination through the education campaign to help the native inhabitants better 

understand the decolonization process, the plebiscite on self-determination and the 

political status options to be voted on,  

 Cognizant of the efforts made by the Guam Commission on Decolonization to 

promote in the Territory the holding of a plebiscite on self-determination, to 

populate the decolonization registry and to move forward with its education 

campaign, and noting that more than 11,000 native inhabitants have been registered 

to vote, a significant increase since 2000,  

 Noting with concern a ruling by a federal court of the United States, as the 

administering Power, in March 2017, that a plebiscite on self-determination could 

not be limited to native inhabitants, which has brought the plebiscite to a halt,  

 Noting, in this regard, the request by a representative of the Governor of Guam 

at the 2017 Caribbean regional seminar that the Special Committee urge the 

administering Power to assume its responsibility in allowing the people of Guam to 

fully exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and help Guam to develop 

ideas on how to overcome the current challenges hindering its ability to reach self-

governance,  

 Recalling that the administering Power has approved a grant to support the 

self-determination education campaign in the Territory,  

 Recalling also that, in a referendum held in 1987, the registered and eligible 

voters of Guam endorsed a draft Guam Commonwealth Act that would establish a 

new framework for relations between the Territory and the administering Power, 

providing for a greater measure of internal self-government for Guam and 

recognition of the right of the Chamorro people of Guam to self -determination for 

the Territory,  

 Aware that negotiations between the administering Power and the territorial 

Government on the draft Guam Commonwealth Act ended in 1997 and that Guam 

has subsequently established a non-binding plebiscite process for a self-

determination vote by the eligible Chamorro voters,  

 Cognizant of the importance of the administering Power continuing to 

implement its programme of transferring surplus federal land to the Government of 

Guam,  

 Noting a call for reform in the programme of the administering Power with 

respect to the thorough, unconditional and expeditious transfer of land property to 

the people of Guam,  

 Noting also the concerns expressed by a representative of the Governor of 

Guam at the 2017 Caribbean regional seminar regarding a potential lawsuit by the 

administering Power over the Chamorro Land Trust programme, which had been put 

in place to facilitate the transfer of land to the original landowners,  

 Noting further the expressed desire of the territorial Government for a visiting 

mission by the Special Committee,  

 Aware of the existing concerns of the Territory regarding the potential social, 

cultural, economic and environmental impacts of the planned transfer of additional 

military personnel of the administering Power to the Territory,  

 Aware also of the concerns expressed by the Territory on this subject before 

the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) at the 

seventy-second session of the General Assembly,  



 
A/72/456 

 

37/77 17-20098 

 

 Recalling the statement made by the Speaker of the thirty-third Guam 

legislature before the Fourth Committee at the seventieth session of the General 

Assembly that the most acute threat to the legitimate exercise of the  decolonization 

of Guam was the incessant militarization of the island by its administering Power, 

and noting the concern expressed regarding the effect of the escalating military 

activities and installations of the administering Power on Guam,  

 Recalling also its resolution 57/140 of 11 December 2002, in which it 

reiterated that military activities and arrangements by administering Powers in the 

Non-Self-Governing Territories under their administration should not run counter to 

the rights and interests of the peoples of the Territories concerned, especially their 

right to self-determination, including independence, and called upon the 

administering Powers concerned to terminate such activities and to eliminate the 

remaining military bases in compliance with the relevant resolutions of the General 

Assembly,  

 Noting the concerns raised by the Territory before the Fourth Committee at the 

seventy-second session of the General Assembly about the involuntary placement of 

the Territory in the midst of regional tensions,  

 Recalling its resolution 35/118 of 11 December 1980, and conscious that 

immigration into Guam has resulted in the indigenous Chamorros becoming a 

minority in their homeland,  

 1. Reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of Guam to self -

determination, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and with

determine freely their future political status in accordance with the relevant 

provisions of the Charter, the Declaration and the relevant resolutions of the Ge neral

with the territorial Government and appropriate bodies of the United Nations 

system, to develop political education programmes for the Territory in order to 

foster an awareness among the people of their right to self-determination in 

conformity with the legitimate political status options, based on the principles 

clearly defined in Assembly resolution 1541 (XV) and other relevant resolutions and 

decisions;  

 4. Welcomes the convening of the Guam Commission on Decolonization for 

the Implementation and Exercise of Chamorro Self-Determination and its ongoing

with the Charter, the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial 

Countries and Peoples and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;
7
  

 6. Calls once again upon the administering Power to take into consideration 

the expressed will of the Chamorro people as supported by Guam voters in the

Guam and the administering Power;  

 11. Calls upon the administering Power to participate in and cooperate fully 

with the work of the Special Committee in order to implement the provisions of 

Article 73 e of the Charter and the Declaration and in order to advise the Committee

formally with New Zealand the option of self-government in free association, its 

decision in August 2005 to hold in February 2006 a referendum on self -

determination on the basis of a draft constitution for Tokelau and a draft treaty of 

free association with New Zealand, and its subsequent decision to hold a  further 

referendum in October 2007, and bearing in mind also that the two referendums did 

not produce the two-thirds majority of valid votes cast required by the General Fono 

to change the status of Tokelau from that of a Non-Self-Governing Territory under 

the administration of New Zealand,  

 Recalling the holding of free and fair elections in the Territory in January 

2017, 

 Noting the 2013 constitutional consultations, to be further considered by the 

Constitution Committee, which were driven by the people of Tokelau and which 

aimed at developing a model of government structure that is culturally appropriate 

and sensitive to their current situation, culminating in the approval and ratification
