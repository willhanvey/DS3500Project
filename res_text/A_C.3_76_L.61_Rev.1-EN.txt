of racism and adequate remedies for victims, and noting with concern the lack of 

effective implementation thereof, 

 Alarmed at the global rise in hate speech, constituting incitement to racial 

discrimination, hostility and violence, stressing the importance of addressing it, and 

in this regard noting the issuance of the United Nations Guidance Note on Addressing 

and Countering COVID-19-related Hate Speech on 11 May 2020, 

 Underlining the need to promote tolerance, inclusion and respect for diversity 

and the need to seek common ground among and within civilizations in order to 

address common challenges to humanity that threaten shared values, universal human 

rights and the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 

intolerance, through cooperation, partnership and inclusion,  

 Alarmed at the spread in many parts of the world of various racist extremist 

movements based on ideologies that seek to promote nationalist, right-wing agendas 

and racial superiority, and stressing that these practices fuel racism, racial 

discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,  

 Deploring the ongoing and resurgent scourges of racism, racial discrimination, 

xenophobia and related intolerance in many regions of the world, often targeting 

migrants and refugees, as well as people of African descent, expressing concern that 

some political leaders and parties have supported such an environment, and in this 

context expressing its support for migrants and refugees in the context of the severe 

discrimination that they may face, 

 Reaffirming the necessity of eliminating racial discrimination against migrants, 

including migrant workers, in relation to issues such as employment, social services, 

including education and health, and access to justice, and that their treatment must be 

in accordance with international human rights instruments and free from racism, 

racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,  

 Deploring the recent incidents of excessive use of force and other human rights 

violations by law enforcement officers against peaceful demonstrators defending the 

rights of Africans and of people of African descent, and recalling Human Rights 

Council resolutions 43/1 of 19 June 2020,2  44/20 of 17 July 20203  and 47/21 of 

13 July 2021,4 

 Recognizing that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 

have a deep negative impact on the enjoyment of human rights, and therefore require 

a united and comprehensive response from the international community,  

 Expressing concern at the loss of life and livelihoods and the disruption to 

economies and societies by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, and its 

negative impact on the enjoyment of human rights around the world, 

disproportionately affecting certain individuals, including those facing racism, racial 

discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, which the pandemic has 

highlighted and exposed, including underlying deep and long-standing structural 

inequalities and fundamental problems in various areas of social, economic, civil and 

political life, and its exacerbation of existing inequalities, and recalling that systemic 

and structural racism and racial discrimination further exacerbate inequality in access 

to health care and treatment, leading to racial disparities in health outcomes and a 

higher rate of mortality and morbidity among individuals and groups facing racial 

discrimination,

 Noting with concern the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on

violence, threats of violence, discrimination and stigmatization,

objectives have yet to be attained, 

 Reiterating that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights 

and have the potential to contribute constructively to the development and well -being

slave trade, including the transatlantic slave trade, and the associated historical 

injustices, as well as the untold suffering caused by colonialism and apartheid, and

indigenous peoples continue to be victims, and acknowledging that the ongoing 

effects must be remedied, 

 Acknowledging the efforts and initiatives undertaken by States to prohibit racial 

discrimination and racial segregation and to engender the full enjoyment of economic, 

social and cultural rights, as well as civil and political rights,

continue to be victims of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 

intolerance, including their contemporary forms and manifestations, some of which 

manifest in violent forms,

intolerance for the successful implementation of the Durban Declaration and 

Programme of Action,

designated 25 March as the annual International Day of Remembrance of the Victims 

of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade, 

 Recalling further, in the above context, the erection of the permanent memorial 

for the victims of slavery and the slave trade, including the transatlantic slave trade,

lest we forget”,

incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention; 

 3. Underlines, in the above context, that the provisions of the Convention do 

not respond effectively to contemporary manifestations of racial discrimination, in

Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in 2001;

subsidiary structures of the existence of both procedural and substantive gaps in the

contemporary and resurgent scourges of racism;  

 6. Recalls Human Rights Council resolution 34/36 of 24 March 2017,6  in
