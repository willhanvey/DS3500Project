Agenda item 105 (a)
Human rights questions: implementation of
human rights instruments

Algeria, Angola, Bangladesh, Belarus, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Eritrea, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Mauritania, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Saudi
Arabia, South Africa, Syrian Arab Republic and Viet Nam: draft resolution

Equitable geographical distribution in the membership of the
human rights treaty bodies

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolution 56/146 of 19 December 2001,

Reaffirming the importance of the goal of universal ratification of the United
Nations human rights instruments,

Welcoming the significant increase in the number of ratifications of United
Nations human rights instruments, which has especially contributed to their
universality,

Reiterating the importance of the effective functioning of treaty bodies
established pursuant to United Nations human rights instruments for the full and
effective implementation of those instruments,

Recalling that, with regard to the election of the members of the human rights
treaty bodies, the Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly have
recognized the importance of giving consideration in their membership to equitable
geographical distribution, gender balance and representation of the principal legal
systems, and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and shall serve in
their personal capacity, and shall be of high moral character, acknowledged
impartiality and recognized competence in the field of human rights,

Reaffirming the significance of national and regional particularities and
various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds, as well as of different
political, economic and legal systems,



2

A/C.3/59/L.32

Recognizing that the United Nations pursues multilingualism as a means of
promoting, protecting and preserving diversity of languages and cultures globally
and that genuine multilingualism promotes unity in diversity and international
understanding,

Recalling also that the Commission on Human Rights and the General
Assembly have encouraged States parties to United Nations human rights treaties,
individually and through meetings of States parties, to consider how to give better
effect, inter alia, to the principle of equitable geographical distribution in the
membership of treaty bodies,

Expressing concern at the regional imbalance in the current composition of the
membership of some of the human rights treaty bodies,

Noting in particular that the status quo tends to be particularly detrimental to
the election of experts from some regional groups,

Convinced that the goal of equitable geographical distribution in the
membership of human rights treaty bodies is perfectly compatible and can be fully
realized and achieved in harmony with the need to ensure gender balance and the
representation of the principal legal systems in those bodies and the high moral
character, acknowledged impartiality and recognized competence in the field of
human rights of their members,

1. Encourages States parties to the United Nations human rights
instruments to adopt concrete actions, inter alia, the possible establishment of quota
distribution systems by geographical region for the election of the members of the
treaty bodies, thereby ensuring the paramount objective of equitable geographical
distribution in the membership of those human rights bodies;

2. Calls upon the States parties to the United Nations human rights
instruments to include, as an agenda item at their forthcoming meetings, a debate on
ways and means to ensure equitable geographical distribution in the membership of
the human rights treaty bodies, based on the recommendations of the Commission
on Human Rights and the Economic and Social Council and the provisions of the
present resolution;

3. Recommends, when considering the possible establishment of a quota by
regions for the election of membership of each treaty body, the introduction of
flexible procedures that encompass the following criteria:

(a) Each of the five regional groups established by the General Assembly
must be assigned a quota of the membership of each treaty body in equivalent
proportion to the number of States parties to the instrument that it represents,

(b) There must be provision for periodic revisions that reflect the relative
changes in the geographical distribution of States parties,

(c) Automatic periodic revisions should be envisaged in order to avoid
amending the text of the instrument when the quotas are revised;

4. Stresses that the process needed to achieve the goal of equitable
geographical distribution in the membership of human rights treaty bodies can
contribute to raising awareness of the importance of gender balance, the
representation of the principal legal systems and the principle that the members of
the treaty bodies shall be elected and shall serve in their personal capacity, and shall



3

A/C.3/59/L.32

be of high moral character, acknowledged impartiality and recognized competence
in the field of human rights;

5. Requests the chairpersons of the human rights treaty bodies to consider at
their next meeting the content of the present resolution and to submit, through the
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, specific recommendations
for the achievement of the goal of equitable geographical distribution in the
membership of the human rights treaty bodies;

6. Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to
submit concrete recommendations on the implementation of the present resolution to
the General Assembly at its sixtieth session;

7. Decides to continue its consideration of this question at its sixtieth
session under the item entitled “Human rights questions: implementation of human
rights instruments”.
