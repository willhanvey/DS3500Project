situation in Côte d’Ivoire and resolution 2295 (2016) on the situation in Mali,  

 Welcoming the overall progress toward sustaining peace, security and stability 

in Liberia, 

 Commending the efforts of the Government of Liberia, in particular the Liberia 

National Police (LNP), Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization (BIN) and Armed 

Forces of Liberia (AFL), to assume full and complete security responsibility across 

Liberia from the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) in line with the 

conclusion of the 30 June 2016 security transition,  

 Stressing that lasting stability requires the Government of Liberia to maintain 

well-functioning, accountable and responsive national institutions, particularly to 

provide for rule of law and to support national reconciliation, expressing concern 

that the Government of Liberia has not demonstrated sufficient progress in this 

regard and encouraging the enhanced assistance of Member States and multilateral 

organizations,  

 Noting with concern the potential for conflict over Liberia’s natural resources 

and disputes related to land ownership and also noting that issues related to 

corruption continue to threaten to undermine stability and the effectiveness of 

government institutions, 

 Encouraging all stakeholders to facilitate inclusive and peaceful elections in 

Liberia and stressing that the responsibility for the conduct and securi ty of free, fair 

and transparent elections in 2017 rests with the Liberian authorities,  

 Commending the efforts of the Government of Liberia to strengthen 

cooperation, including on security, among governments and organizations in the 

sub-region and also noting inter-mission cooperation between UNMIL, the United 

Nations Operation for Côte d’Ivoire (UNOCI) and the United Nations 

Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali (MINUSMA),  

 Determining that the situation in Liberia continues to constitute a threat to 

international peace and security in the region,
