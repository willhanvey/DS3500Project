non-proliferation measure, and convinced that this is a meaningful step in the 

realization of a systematic process for achieving nuclear disarmament,

General Assembly by its resolution 50/245 of 10 September 1996, was opened for 

signature on 24 September 1996,  

 Stressing that a universal and effectively verifiable Treaty constitutes a 

fundamental instrument in the field of nuclear disarmament and non -proliferation 

and will be a major contribution to international peace and security,  

 Stressing also the vital importance and urgency of achieving the entry into 

force of the Treaty, as noted also in Security Council resolution 2310 (2016) of 

23  September 2016, and affirming its resolute determination, 20 years after the

their ratification processes with a view to ensuring their earliest successful
