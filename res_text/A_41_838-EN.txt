following dr aft I: esolut ion:

Implement.ation  of General Assembly resolution 40/88
on the immediate cessation and prohibition of

nuclear -weapon te:;ts

The General Assembly,

Deeply concerned about the intensification of the nuclear-arms race and
the growing threat of nuclear war,

Recalling that over the past three decades the need for cessation and
prohibition of nuclear-weapon testing has been in the focus of attention of
the General Assembly,

Reaffirming its conviction that the conclusion of a multilateral treaty
on the prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests by all States would constitute an
indispensable element for the success of efforts 1 1 halt an,4 reverse the
nuclear-arms race and the quali tatl.ve  improvement of nuclear weapons, and to
prevent the expansion of existing nuclear arsenals and the spread of nuclear
weapons to additional countr  ies, thus contr ibuting to t * achievement of the
final goal of the complete elimination of nuclear weapcjlr:j  under appropr late
veri f ication,

Stteseing once again that the elaboration of such a treaty io the task of
the highest priority and should not be made dependent on the attainment of any
other measure in the field of disarmament,

Recalling  the proposals contained in the Declaration adopted by the heads
of State or Government of six countries at New Delhi on 28 January 1985, z/
and their join: message of 28 February 1985 addressed to the leaders of the
United State8  of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, A/

Recalling  its previous resolutions on this subjef?t, in particular
resolution 40/R&I  of 12 December 1985,

Emphasizing  the importance of verification measuc es, including those
proposed by the leader6 of six countries in the Mexico Declaration that they
adopted at Ixtapa on 7 August 1986, A/

Deeply deplor in9 that the Conference on Disarmament has been unable to
carry out negotiations with a view to reaching agreement on such a treaty,

Deeply deplorinq that appeals to refrain fror nuclear testing have
remained unfulfilled,

1. Urges the Conference on Disarmament to proceed promptly to
negotiat.ions  on all aspects of this matter, including adequate measures on
verification, with the aim of preparing without delay a draft treaty that
would effectively ban all test explosions of nuclear weapon6 by all State6
everywhere and would contain provisions , acceptable to all, pr evznting  the
circumvention of this ban by means of nuclear explosions for peaceful purpose61

2. ReSOlUtely urges all States, and especially al ntlclear-weapon
States, to exert maximum efforts and exercise political wi1.L for the
elaboration and conclusion without delay of such a treat-y8

3. Invites the United States of America - pending the conclusion of
such a treaty - to join the moratorium on nuclear explosions declared
unilaterally and extended several ti,mes by one nuclear-weapon State;

4 . Expresses it6 hope that all other nuclear-weapon States will also
consider joining  in such a moratorium;
