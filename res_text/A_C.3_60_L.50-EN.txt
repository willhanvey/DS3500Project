cultural development,

Recognizing that the principles enshrined in Article 2 of the Charter of the
United Nations, in particular respect for national sovereignty, should be respected in
the holding of elections,

Stressing the responsibility of States in ensuring ways and means to facilitate

Recognizing the contribution made by the United Nations of electoral
assistance provided to numerous States upon their request,

Reaffirming the solemn commitment of all States to fulfil their obligations to
promote universal respect for, and observance and protection of, all human rights
and fundamental freedoms for all in accordance with the Charter, other instruments
relating to human rights, and international law,

Reaffirming also that democracy, sustainable development, and respect for
human rights and fundamental freedoms, and good governance at all levels, are
interdependent and mutually reinforcing and determined to strengthen respect for
the rule of law at national and international levels,

Welcoming the commitment of all Member States, expressed in the United
Nations Millennium Declaration,1 to work collectively for more inclusive political
processes allowing genuine participation by all citizens in all countries,

1. Reaffirms that all peoples have the right to self-determination, by virtue

Nations;

2. Reiterates that periodic, fair and free elections are important elements for
the promotion and protection of human rights;

4. Also reaffirms that free development of the national electoral process in
