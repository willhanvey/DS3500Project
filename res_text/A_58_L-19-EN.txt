Conscious that the problems of ocean space are closely interrelated and need to
be considered as a whole through an integrated, interdisciplinary and intersectoral
approach,

Convinced of the need, building on arrangements established in accordance
with the Convention, to improve coordination at the national level and cooperation
and coordination at both intergovernmental and inter-agency levels, in order to
address all aspects of oceans and seas in an integrated manner,

Recognizing the important role that the competent international organizations
have in relation to ocean affairs, in implementing the Convention and in promoting
the sustainable development of the oceans and seas,

Recalling the essential role of international cooperation and coordination in
promoting the integrated management and sustainable development of the oceans
and seas, and recalling also that the role of international cooperation and
coordination on a bilateral basis and, where applicable, within a subregional,
regional, interregional or global framework is to support and supplement the
national efforts of all States, including coastal States, in promoting the
implementation and observance of the Convention and the integrated management
and sustainable development of coastal and marine areas,

Underlining once again the essential need for capacity-building to ensure that
all States, especially developing countries, in particular least developed countries
and small island developing States, as well as coastal African States, are able both to
implement the Convention and to benefit from the sustainable development of the
oceans and seas,

Underlining also the essential need for capacity-building to ensure that all
States, especially developing countries, in particular least developed countries and
small island developing States, are able to participate fully in global and regional
forums and processes dealing with oceans and law of the sea issues,

Emphasizing the need to strengthen the ability of competent international
organizations to contribute, at the global, regional, subregional and bilateral levels,
including through cooperation programmes with Governments, to the development
of national and local capacity in marine science and the sustainable management of
oceans and their resources,

Recalling the recommendations of the World Summit on Sustainable
Development, including to establish by 2004 a regular process under the United
Nations for global reporting and assessment of the state of the marine environment,
including socio-economic aspects, both current and foreseeable, building on existing
regional assessments,3 and the decision of the General Assembly in its resolution
57/141 to establish such a process by 2004,

Reiterating its deep concern at the situation of many of the world’s fisheries
caused principally by overcapacity, overfishing and illegal, unregulated and
unreported fishing, as well as, in many areas, pollution,

Reiterating its concern at the adverse impacts on the marine environment, in
particular on vulnerable marine ecosystems, including coral, of human activities,
such as overutilization of living marine resources, the use of destructive fishing
practices, physical impacts by ships, the introduction of alien invasive species and
marine pollution from all sources including from land-based sources and vessels, in
particular through the illegal release of oil and other harmful substances and from
dumping, including the dumping of hazardous waste such as radioactive materials,
nuclear waste and dangerous chemicals,

Recognizing that hydrographic surveys and nautical charting are critical to the
safety of navigation and life at sea, environmental protection, including vulnerable
marine ecosystems and the economics of the global shipping industry, and
recognizing in this regard, that the move towards electronic charting not only
provides significantly increased benefits for safe navigation and management of ship
movement, but also provides data and information that can be used for sustainable
fisheries activities and other sectoral uses of the marine environment, the
delimitation of maritime boundaries and environmental protection,

Welcoming the convening by the International Atomic Energy Agency of the
International Conference on the Safety of Transport of Radioactive Material, as well
as the outcomes of the Conference, which provided an opportunity for States to
address issues relating to the transport of radioactive materials, including by sea,

Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General,4 and emphasizing in this
regard the critical role of the annual comprehensive report of the Secretary-General,
which integrates information on developments relating to the implementation of the
Convention and the work of the Organization, its specialized agencies and other
institutions in the field of ocean affairs and the law of the sea at the global and
regional levels, and as a result constitutes the basis for the annual consideration and
review of developments relating to ocean affairs and the law of the sea by the
General Assembly as the global institution having the competence to undertake such
a review,

Taking note also of the report on the work of the United Nations Open-ended
Informal Consultative Process on oceans and the law of the sea (“the Consultative
Process”) established by the General Assembly in its resolution 54/33 in order to
facilitate the annual review by the Assembly of developments in ocean affairs at its
fourth meeting,5

Noting the responsibilities of the Secretary-General under the Convention and
related resolutions of the General Assembly, in particular resolutions 49/28, 52/26
and 54/33, and in this context the expected increase in responsibilities of the
Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea of the Office of Legal Affairs of
the Secretariat in view of the anticipated receipt of submissions from States to the
Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (“the Commission”), in addition
to the expected growing involvement of the Division with new developments such
as the regular process for global reporting and assessment of the state of the marine
environment, including socio-economic aspects, with requests for technical
assistance from States and the role of the Division in inter-agency coordination and
cooperation,

identification of those marine ecosystem types that warrant priority attention; and to
explore a range of potential approaches and tools for their protection and
management; and requests the Secretary-General to cooperate and liaise with those
bodies and to submit an addendum to his annual report to the General Assembly at
