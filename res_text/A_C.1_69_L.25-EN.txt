  The Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Concerned about the increasing regional and global security challenges 

caused, inter alia, by the ongoing proliferation of ballistic missiles capable of 

delivering weapons of mass destruction, 

 Bearing in mind the purposes and principles of the United Nations and its role 

and responsibility in the field of international peace and security in accordance with 

the Charter of the United Nations, 

 Emphasizing the significance of regional and international efforts to prevent 

and curb comprehensively the proliferation of ballistic missile systems capable of 

delivering weapons of mass destruction, as a contribution to international peace and 

security,  

 Welcoming the adoption of The Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic 

Missile Proliferation on 25 November 2002 at The Hague,1 and convinced that the 

Code of Conduct will contribute to enhancing transparency and confidence among 

States, 

 Recalling its resolutions 59/91 of 3 December 2004, 60/62 of 8 December 

2005, 63/64 of 2 December 2008, 65/73 of 8 December 2010 and 67/42 of

3 December 2012 entitled “The Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile 

Proliferation”, 

 Recalling also that the proliferation of ballistic missiles capable of delivering 

weapons of mass destruction, as recognized by the Security Council in its resolution 

1540 (2004) of 28 April 2004 and subsequent resolutions, constitutes a threat to 

international peace and security, 

 Confirming its commitment to the Declaration on International Cooperation in 

the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for the Benefit and in the Interest of All 

States, Taking into Particular Account the Needs of Developing Countries, as 

contained in the annex to its resolution 51/122 of 13 December 1996,  

 Recognizing that States should not be excluded from utilizing the benefits of 

space for peaceful purposes, but that in reaping such benefits and in conducting 

related cooperation they must not contribute to the proliferation of ballistic missiles 

capable of carrying weapons of mass destruction,  

 Mindful of the need to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 

and their means of delivery,  

 1. Welcomes the fact that 137 States have so far subscribed to the Code of 

Conduct as a practical step against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 

and their means of delivery;  

 2. Also welcomes the advancement of the universalization process of the 

Code of Conduct, and underscores the importance of making further efforts, on both 

the regional and the international levels, towards achieving universalization;  

 3. Calls upon all States that have not yet subscribed to the Code of Conduct, 

in particular those possessing space launch vehicle and ballistic missile capabilities 

and those developing corresponding national programmes, to do so;  

 4. Encourages States that have already subscribed to the Code of Conduct 

to make efforts to increase participation in the Code and to further improve its 

implementation;  

 5. Notes progress in the implementation of the Code of Conduct, which 

contributes to enhancing transparency and building confidence among States 

through the submission of pre-launch notifications and annual declarations on space 

and ballistic missile policies, and underlines the importance of further steps in this 

direction; 

 6. Encourages the exploration of further ways and means to deal effectively 

with the problem of the proliferation of ballistic missiles capable of delivering 

weapons of mass destruction and to deepen the relationship between the Code of 

Conduct and the United Nations;  

 7. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-first session, 

under the item entitled “General and complete disarmament”, the sub -item entitled 

“The Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation”.
