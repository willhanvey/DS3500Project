 Strongly condemning the continued border violations from the Syrian Arab 
Republic into neighbouring countries, which have led to casualties among and injuries

such incidents have violated international law and highlighted the grave impact of 
the crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic on the security of its neighbours and on 
regional peace and stability,  

 Deploring the further deterioration of the humanitarian situation and the failure 
of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic to ensure the immediate, safe and 
unimpeded provision of humanitarian assistance to all areas affected by the fighting,  

 Expressing deep concern at the more than 2.2 million refugees, including more 
than 1 million children, and the millions of internally displaced persons fleeing as a 
result of the extreme violence in the Syrian Arab Republic, and at the escalating 
violence causing an influx of Syrian refugees into neighbouring countries and other 
countries in the region,  

 Welcoming the hosting by the Government of Kuwait, on 30 January 2013, of

 Expressing its deep appreciation for the significant efforts that have been 
made by neighbouring countries and other countries in the region to accommodate

 Welcoming the efforts of the United Nations, the League of Arab States and the 
Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States for 
Syria to achieve a solution to the Syrian crisis,  

 1. Strongly condemns the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab 
Republic, which is prohibited under international law, amounts to a serious crime 
and has a devastating impact on civilians, and in particular the massacre in the 
Ghouta area of Damascus, and notes in this regard the report of 16 September 20139 
prepared by the United Nations Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use of 
Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic, which provides clear evidence that 
surface-to-surface rockets were fired on 21 August from Government-held territory 
into opposition areas, using professionally made munitions containing Sarin;  

 2. Also strongly condemns the continued widespread and systematic gross 
violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms and all violations of 
international humanitarian law by the Syrian authorities and the Government 
affiliated shabbiha militias, including those involving the use of heavy weapons, 
aerial bombardments, cluster munitions, ballistic missiles and other force against 
civilians, attacks on schools, hospitals and places of worship, massacres, arbitrary 
executions, extrajudicial killings, the killing and persecution of protestors, human 
rights defenders and journalists, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, 
violations of women’s rights, unlawful interference with access to medical treatment, 
failure to respect and protect medical personnel, torture, systemic sexual and 
gender-based violence, including rape in detention, and ill-treatment, and strongly 
condemns all human rights abuses or violations of international humanitarian law by 
armed extremists, as well as any human rights abuses or violations of international 
humanitarian law by armed anti-Government groups;

13-56885 4/6 
 

 3. Condemns all grave violations and abuses committed against children in 
contravention of applicable international law, such as their recruitment and use, 
killing and maiming, rape and all other forms of sexual violence, attacks on schools 
and hospitals, as well as arbitrary arrest, detention, torture, ill-treatment and their 
use as human shields; 

 4. Also condemns all violence, irrespective of where it comes from, and 
calls upon all parties to immediately put an end to all forms of violence, including 
terrorist acts and acts of violence or intimidation that may foment sectarian tensions, 
and to comply strictly with their obligations under international law, including 
international humanitarian law; 

 5. Demands that all parties immediately put an end to all violations and 
abuses of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, and 
recalls, in particular, the obligation under international humanitarian law to 
distinguish between civilian populations and combatants, the prohibition against 
indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks and all attacks against civilians and 
civilian objects, also demands that all parties to the conflict take all appropriate 
steps to protect civilians, including by desisting from attacks directed against 
civilian objects, such as medical centres, schools and water stations, immediately 
demilitarize such facilities, avoid establishing military positions in populated areas 
and enable the evacuation of the wounded and all civilians who wish to do so from 
besieged areas, and recalls in this regard that the Syrian authorities bear primary 
responsibility for protecting its population; 

 6. Strongly condemns the intervention of all foreign combatants in the 
Syrian Arab Republic, including those fighting on behalf of the Syrian authorities, 
and in particular Hizbullah, and expresses deep concern that their involvement 
further exacerbates the deteriorating human rights and humanitarian situation, which 
has a serious negative impact on the region; 

 7. Demands that the Syrian authorities immediately release all persons 
arbitrarily detained, including the members of the Syrian Centre for Media and 
Freedom of Expression, publish a list of all detention facilities, ensure that 
conditions of detention comply with applicable international law and immediately 
allow access of independent monitors to all detention facilities; 

 8. Also demands that the Syrian authorities fully cooperate with the 
independent international commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic and 
provide it and individuals working on its behalf with immediate, full and unfettered 
entry and access to all areas of the country, and further demands that all parties 
cooperate fully with the commission in the performance of its mandate; 

 9. Welcomes the reports submitted by the independent international 
commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic and the conclusions and 
recommendations contained therein;  

 10. Stresses the importance of ensuring accountability and the need to end 
impunity and hold to account those responsible for violations of international 
humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human rights, including those 
violations that may amount to crimes against humanity, notably in the Ghouta area 
of Damascus on 21 August 2013, and encourages the Security Council to consider 
appropriate measures to ensure accountability in the Syrian Arab Republic, and 



 A/C.3/68/L.42/Rev.1
 

5/6 13-56885 
 

stresses the important role that international criminal justice could play in this 
regard; 

 11. Underlines the importance that the Syrian people, on the basis of broad,

domestic process and mechanisms to achieve reconciliation, truth and accountability 
for gross violations, as well as reparations and effective remedies for the victims; 

 12. Reminds the Security Council of its primary responsibility for the 
maintenance of international peace and security and to take measures to put an end

and abuses of international human rights law committed in the Syrian Arab 
Republic;

civilian facilities, including hospitals, for armed purposes, recalls that under 
international humanitarian law the wounded and sick must receive, to the fullest 
extent practicable, and with the least possible delay, the medical care and attention 
required by their condition, and urges that free passage for medical personnel and 
supplies, including surgical items and medicine be provided to all areas in the 
Syrian Arab Republic; 

 14. Stresses that the magnitude of the humanitarian tragedy caused by the 
conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic requires immediate action to facilitate the safe 
and unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance throughout the entire country, in 
particular in areas and districts where humanitarian needs are especially urgent, 
condemns all cases of arbitrary denial of humanitarian access, and recalls that 
depriving civilians of objects indispensable to their survival, including wilfully 
impeding relief supply and access, can constitute a violation of international 
humanitarian law; 

 15. Demands that the Syrian authorities take immediate steps to facilitate the 
expansion of humanitarian relief operations and lift bureaucratic impediments and 
other obstacles, including through immediately facilitating safe and unimpeded 
access to people in need, through the most effective ways, including across conflict 
lines and across borders, and urges all parties to take all appropriate steps to 
facilitate the efforts of the United Nations, its specialized agencies and all 
humanitarian actors engaged in humanitarian relief activities to provide immediate 
humanitarian assistance to the affected people in the Syrian Arab Republic and to 
nominate empowered interlocutors who can work with humanitarian agencies to

United Nations agencies, in particular the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees, and other donors to provide urgent and coordinated

and decisions of United Nations bodies and the Organization for the Prohibition of 
Chemical Weapons;

democratic and pluralistic society, with the full and effective participation of 
women, in which there is no room for sectarianism or discrimination on ethnic, 
religious, linguistic, gender or any other grounds, based on the promotion of 
universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms;  

 19. Stresses that rapid progress on a political transition represents the best 
opportunity to resolve the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic peacefully, 
reaffirms its support for the engagement of the Secretary-General and the Joint 
Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States for 
Syria and all diplomatic efforts aimed at reaching a political solution to the crisis,
