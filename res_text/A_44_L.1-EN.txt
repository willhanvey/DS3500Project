Death sentence of South African patriot

The General Assembly,

Having considered the question of the death sentence passed in October 1988 at
Grahamstown, South Africa, on Mangena Jeffrey Boesman, a member of the African
National Congress of South Africa,

Gravely concerned over the decision of the South African authorities on
22 September 1989 to refuse executive clemency in respect of the appeal against the

.death sentence,

Conscious that the carrying out of this death sentence would aggravate the
situation in South Africa and thereby deal a severe blow to the prospects for
negotiations to end apartheid,

1. Calls upon the South African authorities as a matter of urgency to
commute the death sentence imposed on Mangena Jeffrey Boesman;

2. Urge~ all States and organizations to use their influence and to take
urgent measures, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, the
resolutions of the Sec~rity Council and relevant international instruments to save
the life of Mangena Jeffrey Boesman;

3. Further calls upon South Africa to commute the death sentences on all
political prisoners as a means of creating an enviromnent conducive to the peaceful
resolution of the situation in South Africa.
