special session of the General Assembly on children, entitled “A world fit for
children”,6 and the outcome of the twenty-sixth special session of the General
Assembly on HIV/AIDS entitled “Global Crisis — Global Action”,7

Noting with appreciation the reports of the Secretary-General on progress
towards achieving the commitments set out in the outcome document of the twenty-
seventh special session of the General Assembly in follow-up to the special session

Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict10
and the Independent Expert for the United Nations study on violence against
children,11

Reaffirming that the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration
in all actions concerning children,

Recognizing the importance of incorporating a child-protection perspective
across the human rights agenda, as highlighted in the outcome of the 2005 World
Summit,

Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world
remains critical in an increasingly globalized environment as a result of the
persistence of poverty, social inequality, inadequate social and economic conditions,
pandemics, in particular HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, environmental
damage, natural disasters, armed conflict, displacement, violence, abuse,
exploitation, trafficking in children and their organs, child prostitution, child
pornography and child sex tourism, neglect, illiteracy, hunger, intolerance,
discrimination, racism, xenophobia, gender inequality, disability and inadequate
legal protection, and convinced that urgent and effective national and international
action is called for,

Underlining the need for mainstreaming a gender perspective in all policies
and programmes relating to children, and recognizing the child as a rights holder in
all policies and programmes relating to children,

Implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and
its Optional Protocols

continue to cooperate closely with all these mechanisms, in particular the special
rapporteurs and special representatives of the United Nations system;

6. Encourages States to strengthen their national statistical capacities and to
use statistics disaggregated, inter alia, by age, gender and other relevant factors that

and local levels;

8. Encourages States to adopt and enforce laws and improve the

obligations of each State, the right of a child whose parents reside in different States

both States and by respecting the principle that both parents have common
responsibilities for the upbringing and development of their children;

non-discrimination through making primary education compulsory and available
free to all children, ensuring that all children have access to education of good

criminalize such practices;

34. Taking note with appreciation of the adoption of Security Council
resolution 1612 (2005) of 26 July 2005 on the protection of children affected by

of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed
Conflict in paragraphs 35 to 37 of General Assembly resolution 51/77 of
12 December 1996, and, bearing in mind the report of the Secretary-General on the

further period of three years;

36. Recalls the recommendation contained in resolution 51/77 that the
Special Representative foster international cooperation to ensure respect for

and the use of child-targeted media and to ensure that this information is relevant,
gender and age-appropriate and timely, engaging the meaningful participation of
children and their parents or caregivers in its development and recognizing children
as agents of change, to enable them to protect themselves from HIV infection;

(b) To support adolescents to be able to deal positively and responsibly with
their sexuality in order to protect themselves from HIV/AIDS infection and to
implement measures to increase their capacity to protect themselves from
HIV/AIDS, through, inter alia, the provision of health care, including for sexual and
reproductive health, and through prevention education that promotes gender
equality;

(c) To put in place strategies, policies and programmes that identify and
address those factors that make individuals particularly vulnerable to HIV infection
in order to complement prevention programmes that address activities that place
individuals at risk of HIV infection, such as risky and unsafe sexual behaviour and
injecting drug use;

(d) To ensure that, in preventing and addressing HIV/AIDS, particular
attention is paid to girls, deeply concerned that the global HIV/AIDS pandemic
disproportionately affects women and girls, that the majority of new HIV infections
occur among young people and that unequal legal, economic and social status,
negative or judgmental attitudes that limit the ability of girls to take preventative
measures and violence against girls increase their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS;

(e) To take measures to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV,
including the provision of essential drugs, appropriate antenatal, delivery and post-
partum care, voluntary and confidential counselling and testing services for
pregnant women and their partners and support for mothers, such as counselling on
infant feeding options and access to treatment, including antiretroviral treatment;

39. Also calls upon States:

(a) To ensure full and equal access for children to voluntary, free and
confidential counselling, testing and care, including affordable and effective
medication for the treatment of HIV and AIDS and associated opportunistic

regional and international levels in order to offer infected and affected children
medicines and related technology, which are affordable, easy to use and readily
available, in supporting developing countries that may not have the financial or
human resources capacity to mount an effective response to the HIV/AIDS
epidemic;

(c) To integrate all aspects of HIV and AIDS prevention, treatment, care and
support into all health care programmes and services;

40. Further calls upon States to take effective measures to eliminate
stigmatization and discrimination on the basis of HIV or AIDS status, actual or
presumed, of the child or parent and to ensure that HIV or AIDS status does not
stand in the way of the child’s enjoyment of all human rights;



11

HIV/AIDS who can no longer live with their parents to retain links with their wider
family and community, urges all States to implement the United Nations Framework
for the Protection, Care and Support of Orphans and Vulnerable Children Living in
a World with HIV and AIDS and its key strategies, inter alia, through adopting and
implementing, as an integral part of their comprehensive national planning and
budgeting processes, national action plans for the protection and care of orphans and
vulnerable children, and requests donors, the United Nations system and civil
society to support their efforts;

42. Urges donors:

(a) To ensure, by 2007, a complete and successful replenishment of the
Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, as well as the HIV/AIDS

programmes engaged in the fight against HIV/AIDS, and notes that a major part of
the international HIV and AIDS financing gap relates to children orphaned or made
vulnerable by HIV/AIDS;

Children and Armed Conflict to continue to submit reports to the General Assembly
and the Commission on Human Rights;

(c) To request the Independent Expert conducting the study on violence
against children to present his final report to the sixty-first session of the General
Assembly;

of the Child to present an oral report on the work of the Committee to the General
Assembly at its sixty-first session as a way to enhance communication between the
