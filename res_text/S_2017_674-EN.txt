  United States of America: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous relevant resolutions, including resolution 825 (1993), 

resolution 1540 (2004), resolution 1695 (2006), resolution 1718 (2006), resolution 

1874 (2009), resolution 1887 (2009), resolution 2087 (2013), resolution 2094 

(2013), resolution 2270 (2016), resolution 2321 (2016), and resolution 2356 (2017), 

as well as the statements of its President of 6 October 2006 (S/PRST/2006/41), 

13 April 2009 (S/PRST/2009/7) and 16 April 2012 (S/PRST/2012/13),  

 Reaffirming that proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as 

well as their means of delivery, constitutes a threat to international peace and 

security,  

 Expressing its gravest concern at the July 3 and July 28 of 2017 ballistic 

missile tests by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (“the DPRK”), which 

the DPRK has stated were tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles, in violation of 

resolutions 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009), 2087 (2013), 2094 (2013), 2270 (2016), 2321 

(2016), and 2356 (2017), and at the challenge such tests constitute to the Treaty on 

Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (“the NPT”) and to international efforts 

aimed at strengthening the global regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, 

and the danger they pose to peace and stability in the region and beyond,  

 Underlining once again the importance that the DPRK respond to other 

security and humanitarian concerns of the international community,  

 Underlining also that measures imposed by this resolution are not intended to 

have adverse humanitarian consequences for the civilian population of the DPRK,  

 Expressing serious concern that the DPRK has continued to violate relevant 

Security Council resolutions through repeated launches and attempted launches of 

ballistic missiles, and noting that all such ballistic missile activities contribute to the 

DPRK’s development of nuclear weapons delivery systems and increase tension in 

the region and beyond, 

 Expressing continued concern that the DPRK is abusing the privileges and 

immunities accorded under the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular 

Relations, 

 Expressing great concern that the DPRK’s prohibited arms sales have 

generated revenues that are diverted to the pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic 

missiles while DPRK citizens have unmet needs,
