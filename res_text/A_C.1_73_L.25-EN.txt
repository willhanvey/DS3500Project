weapons of mass destruction, 

 Bearing in mind the purposes and principles of the United Nations and its role

delivering weapons of mass destruction, as a contribution to international peace and 

security, 

 Welcoming the adoption of the Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile 

Proliferation on 25 November 2002 at The Hague, 1 and convinced that the Code of 

Conduct will contribute to enhancing transparency and confidence among States, 

 Recalling its resolutions 59/91 of 3 December 2004, 60/62 of 8 December 2005, 

63/64 of 2 December 2008, 65/73 of 8 December 2010, 67/42 of 3 December 2012,

 Recalling also that the proliferation of ballistic missiles capable of delivering 

weapons of mass destruction, as recognized by the Security Council in its resolution 

1540 (2004) of 28 April 2004 and subsequent resolutions, constitutes a threat to 

international peace and security,  

 Confirming its commitment to the Declaration on International Cooperation in 

the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for the Benefit and in the Interest of All 

States, Taking into Particular Account the Needs of Developing Countries, as 

contained in the annex to its resolution 51/122 of 13 December 1996, 

 Recognizing that States should not be excluded from utilizing the benefits of 

space for peaceful purposes, but that in reaping such benefits and in conducting 

related cooperation they must not contribute to the proliferation of ballistic missiles 

capable of carrying weapons of mass destruction,  

 Noting the efforts of subscribing States, undertaken in cooperation with the 

Office for Disarmament Affairs of the Secretariat, to raise awareness of the Code of 

Conduct through the preparation of educational material,  

 Mindful of the need to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 

and their means of delivery, 

 1. Welcomes the fact that 139 States have so far subscribed to the Hague Code 

of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation1 as a practical step against the 

proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery;  

 2. Also welcomes the advancement of the universalization process of the 

Code of Conduct, and underscores the importance of further advancing, at both the 

regional and the international levels, the universalization of the Code;  

 3. Invites all States that have not yet subscribed to the Code of Conduct, in 

particular those possessing space launch vehicle and ballistic missile capabilities and 

those developing corresponding national programmes, to do so, bearing in mind the 

right to use space for peaceful purposes; 

 4. Encourages States that have already subscribed to the Code of Conduct to 

make efforts to increase participation in the Code and to further improve its 

implementation; 

 5. Notes progress in the implementation of the Code of Conduct, which 

contributes to enhancing transparency and building confidence among States through 

the submission of pre-launch notifications and annual declarations on space launch 

vehicle and ballistic missile policies, and underlines the importance of further  steps 

in this direction; 

 6. Encourages the exploration of further ways and means to deal effectively 

with the problem of the proliferation of ballistic missiles capable of delivering 

weapons of mass destruction, to take the measures necessary to avoid contributing to 

such delivery systems, and to continue to deepen the relationship between the Code 

of Conduct and the United Nations; 

 7. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-fifth session, 

under the item entitled “General and complete disarmament”, the sub-item entitled 

“The Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation”.
