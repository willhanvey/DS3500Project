resolutions,

Expressing its concern at the humanitarian effects of the present situation
on the civilian population in Angola,

therein from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Angola to the

General to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Angola of
2 August (S/1999/871, annex II),
