Noting recent efforts to bring to an end the use of children as soldiers in
violation of international law, in International Labour Organization Convention
No. 182 on the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst
Forms of Child Labour which prohibits forced or compulsory labour, including the
forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict, and in
the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in which conscripting or
enlisting children under the age of fifteen into national armed forces or using
them to participate actively in hostilities is characterized as a war crime,

1. Expresses its grave concern at the harmful and widespread impact of
armed conflict on children and the long-term consequences this has for durable
peace, security and development;

2. Strongly condemns the targeting of children in situations of armed
conflict, including killing and maiming, sexual violence, abduction and forced
displacement, recruitment and use of children in armed conflict in violation of
international law, and attacks on objects protected under international law,
including places that usually have a significant presence of children such as
schools and hospitals, and calls on all parties concerned to put an end to such
practices;

3. Calls upon all parties concerned to comply strictly with their
obligations under international law, in particular the Geneva Conventions of
12 August 1949 and the obligations applicable to them under the Additional
Protocols thereto of 1977 and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child of 1989, and stresses the responsibility of all States to bring an end to
impunity and their obligation to prosecute those responsible for grave breaches
of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949;

measures;

unhindered access of humanitarian personnel and the delivery of humanitarian
assistance to all children affected by armed conflict;

movement of United Nations and associated personnel to the alleviation of the
impact of armed conflict on children, and urges all parties to armed conflicts
to respect fully the status of United Nations and associated personnel;

14. Recognizes the deleterious impact of the proliferation of arms, in
particular small arms, on the security of civilians, including refugees and
other vulnerable populations, particularly children, and, in this regard, it
recalls resolution 1209 (1998) of 19 November 1998 which, inter alia, stresses

conflicts, and which urged international collaboration in combating illegal arms
flows;

the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed
Conflict, UNICEF, UNHCR and other relevant agencies of the United Nations system
to intensify their efforts in this regard;

to give special attention to the protection, welfare and rights of children, and
requests the Secretary-General to include in his reports recommendations in this
regard;

17. Reaffirms its readiness when dealing with situations of armed
conflict:

(a) to continue to support the provision of humanitarian assistance to
civilian populations in distress, taking into account the particular needs of
children including, inter alia, the provision and rehabilitation of medical and
educational services to respond to the needs of children, the rehabilitation of
children who have been maimed or psychologically traumatized, and child-focused
mine clearance and mine-awareness programmes;

(b) to continue to support the protection of displaced children including
their resettlement by UNHCR and others as appropriate; and

(c) whenever adopting measures under Article 41 of the Charter of the
United Nations, to give consideration to their impact on children, in order to
consider appropriate humanitarian exemptions;

whenever buildings or sites which usually have a significant presence of
children are specifically targeted in situations of armed conflict, in violation
of international law;

19. Requests the Secretary-General to ensure that personnel involved in
United Nations peacemaking, peacekeeping and peace-building activities have
