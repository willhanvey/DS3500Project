 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 61/194 of 20 December 2006 on the oil slick on 
Lebanese shores,  

 Reaffirming the outcome of the United Nations Conference on the Human 
Environment, especially principle 7 of the Declaration of the Conference,1 which 
requested States to take all possible steps to prevent pollution of the seas,  

 Emphasizing the need to protect and preserve the marine environment in 
accordance with international law, 

 Taking into account the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and 
Development,2 especially principle 16, which stipulates that the polluter should, in 
principle, bear the cost of pollution, and taking into account also chapter 17 of 
Agenda 21,3  

 Noting again with great concern the environmental disaster caused by the 
destruction by the Israeli Air Force on 15 July 2006 of the oil storage tanks in the 
direct vicinity of the Jiyah electric power plant in Lebanon, resulting in an oil slick 
that covered the entirety of the Lebanese coastline and extended to the Syrian 
coastline,

 Noting again with appreciation the assistance offered by donor countries and 
international organizations for the early recovery and reconstruction of Lebanon 
through bilateral and multilateral channels, including the Athens Coordination 
Meeting on the response to the marine pollution incident in the Eastern 
Mediterranean, held on 17 August 2006, as well as the Stockholm Conference for 
Lebanon’s Early Recovery, held on 31 August 2006,  

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General4 on the implementation 
of General Assembly resolution 61/194 on the oil slick on Lebanese shores;  

 2. Reiterates the expression of its deep concern over the adverse 
implications of the destruction by the Israeli Air Force of the oil storage tanks in the 
direct vicinity of the Lebanese Jiyah electric power plant for the achievement of 
sustainable development in Lebanon;  

 3. Considers that the oil slick has heavily polluted the shores of Lebanon 
and partially polluted Syrian shores and consequently has had serious implications 
for livelihoods and the economy of Lebanon, owing to the adverse implications for 
natural resources, biodiversity, fisheries and tourism, and for human health, in the 
country;  

 4. Requests the Government of Israel to assume responsibility for prompt 
and adequate compensation to the Government of Lebanon and other countries 
directly affected by the oil slick for the costs of repairing the environmental damage 
caused by the destruction, including the restoration of the marine environment;  

 5. Expresses its appreciation for the efforts of the Government of Lebanon 
and those of the Member States, regional and international organizations, regional 
and international financial institutions, non-governmental organizations and the 
private sector in the initiation of clean-up and rehabilitation operations on the 
polluted shores, and encourages the Member States and above-mentioned entities to 
continue their financial and technical support to the Government of Lebanon 
towards achieving the completion of clean-up and rehabilitation operations, with the 
aim of preserving the ecosystem of Lebanon and that of the Eastern Mediterranean 
Basin;  

 6. Calls for the mobilization of international technical and financial 
assistance through donor support for the creation of an eastern Mediterranean oil 
spill restoration fund, based on voluntary contributions, to support the integrated 
environmentally sound management, from clean-up to safe disposal of oily waste, of 
this environmental disaster resulting from the destruction by the Israeli Air Force of 
the oil storage tanks at the Jiyah electric power plant; 

 7. Recognizes the multidimensionality of the adverse impact of the oil slick, 
and requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its sixty-
third session a report on the implementation of the present resolution under the item 
entitled “Sustainable development”.
