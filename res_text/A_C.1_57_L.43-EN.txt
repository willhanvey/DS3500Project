Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special
Session of the General Assembly,3 the first special session devoted to disarmament,

and phased programme with agreed time frames, wherever feasible, for the
progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery,
leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time,

Noting the reiteration by the States parties to the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons4 of their conviction that the Treaty is a

Test-Ban Treaty,7

Noting with appreciation the signing of the Strategic Offensive Reductions

America as a significant step towards reducing their deployed strategic nuclear
weapons, while calling for further irreversible deep cuts in their nuclear arsenals,

Also noting with appreciation the unilateral measures by the nuclear-weapon
States for nuclear arms limitations, and encouraging them to take further such
measures,

replace multilateral negotiations in this respect,

Noting the support expressed in the Conference on Disarmament and in the

an international convention at an early date,

Recalling the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the
Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons,8 issued on 8 July 1996, and

an ad hoc committee to commence negotiations in 1998 on a phased programme of
nuclear disarmament and for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons with a
specified framework of time,

Recalling paragraph 72 of the Final Document of the Thirteenth Ministerial
Conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Cartagena,

session of 1999,11

Welcoming the United Nations Millennium Declaration,12 in which heads of
State and Government resolve to strive for the elimination of weapons of mass
destruction, in particular nuclear weapons, and to keep all options open for
achieving this aim, including the possibility of convening an international
conference to identify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers,

Reaffirming that, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, States
should refrain from the use or the threat use of nuclear-weapons in settling their
disputes in international relations,

Seized of the danger of the use of weapons of mass destruction, particularly
