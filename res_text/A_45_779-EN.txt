&pscio~  that the nuclear-arms race increases the danger of the use of
nuclear weapons,

Convincgd.  that nuclear disarmament is the only ultimate guarantee against the
use of nuclear weapons,

Convinced alsq that a multilateral agreemsnt prohibiting the use or threat of
use of nuclear weapons should strengthen international security and help to create
the climate for negotiations leading to the complete elimination of nuclear weapons,

America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics towards a reduction of their
nuclear weapons and the improvement in East-West relations and the international
climate can contribute towards this goal,

Recalling that, in paragraph 58 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special
Session of the General Assembly, fi/ it is stated that all States should actively
participate in efforts to bring about conditions in international relations among
States in which a code of peaceful conduct of nations in international affairs
could be agreed upon and that would preclude the use or threat of use of nuclear
weapons,

Reaffirm- that the use of nuclear weapons would be a violation of thb
Charter of the United Nations and a crime against humanity, as declared in its
resolutions 1653 (XVI) of 24 November 1961, 33/71 B of 14 December 1978, 34183 G of
11 December 1979, 35/152 D of 12 December 1980 and 36/92 I of 9 December 1981,

Notinu  with regret that the Conference on Disarmament, during its 1990 session
was not able to undertake negotiations with a view to achieving agreement on aA
international convention prohibiting the use or threat of use of nuclear  weapons
under any circumstances, taking as a basis the text annexed to General Assembly
resolution 44/117 C of 15 December 1989,

1. Reiterates its reauea to the Conference on Disarmament to commence
negotiations, as  a  mat ter  of priority, in order to reach agreement on an
international convention prohibiting the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons
under any circumstances, taking as a basis the draft Convention on the Prohibition
of the Use of Nuclear Weapons annexed to the present resolution;
