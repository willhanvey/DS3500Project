 Resolving to strengthen the central role of the United Nations in peacekeeping 
and to ensure the effective functioning of the collective security system established

 Noting that peacekeeping ranges from traditional peacekeeping missions, 
which primarily monitor ceasefire to complex multidimensional operations, which 
seek to undertake peacebuilding tasks and address root causes of conflict, 

 Reaffirming that respect for the basic principles of peacekeeping, including 
consent of the parties, impartiality, and non-use of force, except in self-defence and

approach to the maintenance of international peace and security by preventing 
conflicts, preventing relapse and building sustainable peace through effective 
preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peacekeeping and peacebuilding strategies,

with relevant stakeholders, the strength, mandate, and composition of peacekeeping 
operations with a view to making the necessary adjustments where appropriate, 
according to progress achieved or changing circumstances on the ground including
