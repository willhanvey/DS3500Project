Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,

Assistance to Palestine refugees

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolution 54/69 of 6 December 1999 and all its previous
resolutions on the question, including resolution 194 (III) of 11 December 1948,

Taking note of the report of the Commissioner-General of the United Nations
Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East covering the
period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000,1

Stressing the importance of the Middle East peace process,

Welcoming the signature in Washington D.C., on 13 September 1993 by the
Government of the State of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, the
representative of the people of Palestine, of the Declaration of Principles on Interim
Self-Government Arrangements2 and the subsequent implementation agreements,

Aware that the Multilateral Working Group on Refugees of the Middle East
peace process has an important role to play in the peace process,

1. Notes with regret that repatriation or compensation of the refugees, as
provided for in paragraph 11 of its resolution 194 (III), has not yet been effected and
that, therefore, the situation of the refugees continues to be a matter of concern;

2. Notes with regret that the United Nations Conciliation Commission for
Palestine has been unable to find a means of achieving progress in the
implementation of paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), and

A/C.4/55/L.10

requests the Commission to exert continued efforts towards the implementation of
that paragraph and to report to the Assembly as appropriate, but no later than
1 September 2001;

3. Expresses its thanks to the Commissioner-General and to all the staff of
the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near
East, recognizing that the Agency is doing all it can within the limits of available
resources, and also expresses its thanks to the specialized agencies and to private
organizations for their valuable work in assisting refugees;

4. Notes the significant success of the Peace Implementation Programme of
the Agency since the signing of the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-
Government Arrangements, and stresses the importance that contributions to this
Programme not be at the expense of the General Fund;

5. Welcomes the increased cooperation between the Agency and
international and regional organizations, States and relevant agencies and non-
governmental organizations, which is essential to enhancing the contributions of the
Agency towards improved conditions for the refugees and thereby the social
stability of the occupied territory;

6. Urges all Member States to extend and expedite aid and assistance with a
view to the economic and social development of the Palestinian people and the
occupied territory;

7. Reiterates its deep concern regarding the persisting critical financial
situation of the Agency, as outlined in the report of the Commissioner-General;1

8. Commends the efforts of the Commissioner-General to move towards
budgetary transparency and internal efficiency, and welcomes in this respect the
new, unified budget structure for the biennium 2001-2002, which can contribute
significantly to improved budgetary transparency of the Agency;

9. Welcomes the consultative process between the Agency, host
Governments, the Palestinian Authority and donors on management reforms;

10. Notes with profound concern that the continuing shortfall in the finances
of the Agency has a significant negative influence on the living conditions of the
Palestine refugees most in need and that it therefore has possible consequences for
the peace process;

11. Calls upon all donors, as a matter of urgency, to make the most generous
efforts possible to meet the anticipated needs of the Agency, including the remaining
costs of moving the headquarters to Gaza, and encourages contributing Governments
to contribute regularly and to consider increasing their regular contributions, and
urges non-contributing Governments to contribute.
