United Nations stipulating that a function of the General Assembly is to consider the 
general principles of cooperation in the maintenance of international peace and 
security, including the principles governing disarmament and arms limitation, 

 Recalling its resolutions 40/151 G of 16 December 1985, 41/60 D of 
3 December 1986, 42/39 J of 30 November 1987 and 43/76 D of 7 December 1988 
on the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa, and its 
resolutions 46/36 F of 6 December 1991 and 47/52 G of 9 December 1992 on 
regional disarmament, including confidence-building measures, 

 Recalling also its resolutions 48/76 E of 16 December 1993, 49/76 D of 
15 December 1994, 50/71 C of 12 December 1995, 51/46 E of 10 December 1996,

of 8 December 2005 and 61/93 of 6 December 2006,

 Taking into account the need to establish close cooperation between the 
Regional Centre and the Peace and Security Council of the African Union, in 
particular its institutions in the field of peace, disarmament and security, as well as 
with relevant United Nations bodies and programmes in Africa for greater 
effectiveness, 

 Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General,1 in which he stated that the 
Regional Centre’s ability to fulfil its mandate continued to be hampered by the lack 
of funding, in particular core funding, 

 Deeply concerned that, as noted in the report of the Secretary-General, 
voluntary contributions continued to decline and remained insufficient for the 
Centre to fulfil its mandate effectively and efficiently, and that there is no 
foreseeable reliable source of funding that would ensure its operational 
sustainability, 

 Recalling that the General Assembly, in its resolution 60/86, requested the 
Secretary-General to establish, within existing resources, a Consultative Mechanism 
of interested States, in particular African States, for the reorganization of the United 
Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa, 

 1. Notes with satisfaction the conclusion of the work of the Consultative 
Mechanism for the Reorganization of the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace 
and Disarmament in Africa, which made concrete recommendations on the Centre’s 
future work programme, as well as on its staffing and funding; 

 2. Notes with appreciation the recommendations of the Consultative 
Mechanism on the Centre’s future work programme, as well as on its staffing and 
funding; 

 3. Invites the Regional Centre, taking into account the availability of 
financial resources, to focus its actions on the priorities identified in the 
recommendations of the Consultative Mechanism; 

 4. Recommends that three posts (one Professional at the P-3 level and two 
General Service (Other level) be established and added to the structure of the 
Centre, and funded from the regular budget, as recommended by the Consultative 
Mechanism; 

 5. Also recommends that the operating costs of the Centre be funded from 
the regular budget; 

 6. Urges all States, as well as international governmental and 
non-governmental organizations and foundations, to make voluntary contributions 
in order to strengthen the programmes and activities of the Regional Centre and 
facilitate their implementation; 

 7. Requests the Secretary-General to continue to provide the necessary 
support to the Regional Centre for better achievements and results; 

 8. Also requests the Secretary-General to facilitate close cooperation 
between the Regional Centre and the African Union, in particular in the areas of 
peace, security and development, and to continue to provide assistance towards 
stabilizing the financial situation of the Centre;
