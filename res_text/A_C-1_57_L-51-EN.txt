Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons

People’s Republic of Korea, Egypt, Fiji, Guyana, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Iran

Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons

The General Assembly,

Convinced that the use of nuclear weapons poses the most serious threat to the
survival of mankind,

Bearing in mind the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of
8 July 1996 on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons,

Convinced that a multilateral, universal and binding agreement prohibiting the
use or threat of use of nuclear weapons would contribute to the elimination of the
nuclear threat and to the climate for negotiations leading to the ultimate elimination
of nuclear weapons, thereby strengthening international peace and security,

Conscious that some steps taken by the Russian Federation and the United
States of America towards a reduction of their nuclear weapons and the
improvement in the international climate can contribute towards the goal of the
complete elimination of nuclear weapons,

Recalling that, in paragraph 58 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special
Session of the General Assembly,1 it is stated that all States should actively
participate in efforts to bring about conditions in international relations among
States in which a code of peaceful conduct of nations in international affairs could
be agreed upon and that would preclude the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons,

A/C.1/57/L.51

Reaffirming that any use of nuclear weapons would be a violation of the
Charter of the United Nations and a crime against humanity, as declared in its
resolutions 1653 (XVI) of 24 November 1961, 33/71 B of 14 December 1978,
34/83 G of 11 December 1979, 35/152 D of 12 December 1980 and 36/92 I of
9 December 1981,

Determined to achieve an international convention prohibiting the
development, production, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons, leading to their
ultimate destruction,

Stressing that an international convention on the prohibition of the use of
nuclear weapons would be an important step in a phased programme towards the
complete elimination of nuclear weapons, with a specified framework of time,

Noting with regret that the Conference on Disarmament, during its 2002
session, was unable to undertake negotiations on this subject as called for in General
Assembly resolution 56/25 B of 29 November 2001,

1. Reiterates its request to the Conference on Disarmament to commence
negotiations in order to reach agreement on an international convention prohibiting
the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances;

2. Requests the Conference on Disarmament to report to the General
Assembly on the results of those negotiations.
