 Concerned that applicable international human rights obligations and treaties, 

to which Ukraine is a party, are not respected by the occupying Power in Crimea, thus 

significantly decreasing the level of human rights in Crimea since its temporary 

occupation by the Russian Federation, 

 Reaffirming the obligation of States to ensure that persons belonging to national 

or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities may exercise fully and effectively all 

human rights and fundamental freedoms without any discrimination and  in full 

equality before the law,

for Human Rights on the human rights situation in Ukraine, of the Commissioner for 

Human Rights of the Council of Europe and of the human rights assessment mission 

of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights and the High 

Commissioner on National Minorities of the Organization for Security and 

Cooperation in Europe, in which they stated that violations and abuses of human 

rights continued to take place in Crimea and pointed to the sharp deterioration of the 

overall human rights situation,

Commissioner for Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the temporarily

Secretary-General submitted pursuant to resolutions 73/263,10 74/16811 and 75/192,12  

 Expressing its concern about the fact of prosecution by the occupying 

authorities of the Russian Federation in Crimea for publication  of the reports of the 

Secretary-General submitted pursuant to the resolutions of the General Assembly on 

the situation of human rights in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and th e city of 

Sevastopol, Ukraine,  

 Reaffirming its grave concern that the human rights monitoring mission in 

Ukraine and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special 

Monitoring Mission to Ukraine have continuously been denied access by the  

occupying Power to Crimea, despite their existing mandates, which cover the entire 

territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, and emphasizing 

the indispensable value that the human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine should 

provide in monitoring the human rights situation in Crimea as a priority activity 

according to its mandate, 

 Concerned about additional challenges for the enjoyment of human rights and 

fundamental freedoms by residents of Crimea resulting from unnecessary and 

disproportionate restrictive measures taken by the occupying Power under the pretext 

of combating the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as about the 

lack of ensuring and maintaining public health and hygiene, including measures on 

preventing the spread of COVID-19, in Crimea by the occupying Power in accordance 

with international humanitarian law,  

 Expressing its grave concern about the inadequate conditions of detention in 

penitentiary institutions, including overcrowded cells and a lack of p roper medical 

care, which exposes the detainees to the risk of the spread of diseases, including 

COVID-19,

 Recalling the prohibition under international humanitarian law for the 

occupying Power to compel the inhabitants of an occupied territory to swear 

allegiance to the occupying Power,  

 Condemning the imposition and retroactive application of the legal system of 

the Russian Federation, and its negative impact on the human rights situation in 

Crimea, the imposition of automatic Russian citizenship on protected persons in

others,

archaeological excavations, illicit transfer of cultural property and persecution of 

religious traditions, thereby purposefully erasing Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar 

cultural identities from the ethnocultural landscape of Crimea,  

 Expressing concern about the militarization and assimilation of young people in 

Crimea by the Russian Federation, including combat training for Crimean children 

for military service in the Russian armed forces and the introduction of a “military -

patriotic” education system, and its blocking of the access of residents of Crimea to

occupies, are prohibited under international humanitarian law, regardless of their 

motive,

policies and conducts practices aimed at changing the demographic structure in

to refrain from obtaining property in violation of applicable international law,  

 Concerned about additional challenges for the enjoyment of human rights by 

residents of Crimea resulting from disruptive activities of the occupying Power,

expropriation of land, demolition of houses and depletion of natural and agricultural 

resources, which have a negative impact on the physical character of Crimea and thus 

contribute to changing the economic and demographic structure of Crimea,  

 Reaffirming its serious concern that, according to the decision of the so-called 

“Supreme Court of Crimea” of 26 April 2016 and the decision of the Supreme Court 

of the Russian Federation of 29 September 2016, the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar 

People, the self-governing body of the indigenous people of Crimea – the Crimean

 Condemning the continuous widespread misuse of counter-terrorism and 

anti-extremism laws to suppress dissent,  

 Strongly condemning in this regard the ongoing pressure and mass detentions 

on terrorism, extremism and espionage grounds and other forms of repression against

and freedom to seek, receive and impart information and the enjoyment of other 

human rights and fundamental freedoms, concerned about reports that journalists, 

media workers and citizen journalists continue to face unjustified interference with 

their reporting activities in Crimea, and expressing deep concern that journalists, 

media workers and citizen journalists have been arbitrarily arrested, detained, 

prosecuted, harassed and intimidated in Crimea as a direct result of their reporting 

activities, 

 Underlining the importance of the measures to develop transparent, accessible, 

non-discriminatory and expeditious procedures and regulations governing access to 

Crimea for human rights defenders, journalists, media workers and lawyers, as well 

as the possibility to appeal, in accordance with national legislation and in conformity 

with all applicable international law,  

 Condemning the blocking by the Russian Federation of Ukrainian websites and 

television channels and the seizure of Ukrainian transmission frequencies in Crimea,  

 Welcoming the support provided by Ukraine to media outlets and civil society 

organizations that have fled Crimea, which improves the ability of the media and civil 

society to work independently and without interference,  

 Concerned about the continuing impunity in reported cases of enforced 

disappearances perpetrated in Crimea,  

 Gravely concerned by the recent documented cases in which the Federal
