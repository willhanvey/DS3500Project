16-19541 2/2 

 

 Noting with satisfaction the convening in Madrid on 30 October 1991 of the 

Peace Conference on the Middle East, on the basis of Security Council resolutions 

242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, 338 (1973) of 22 October 1973 and 425 (1978) of 

19 March 1978 and the formula of land for peace,  

 Expressing grave concern over the halt in the peace process on the Syrian 

track, and expressing the hope that peace talks will soon resume from the point they 

had reached, 

 1. Declares that Israel has failed so far to comply with Security Council 

resolution 497 (1981); 

 2. Also declares that the Israeli decision of 14 December 1981 to impose its 

laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan is null and void 

and has no validity whatsoever, as confirmed by the Security Council in its 

resolution 497 (1981), and calls upon Israel to rescind it;  

 3. Reaffirms its determination that all relevant provisions of the 

Regulations annexed to the Hague Convention of 1907, and the Geneva Convention 

relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949,
2 

continue to apply to the Syrian territory occupied by Israel since 1967, and calls 

upon the parties thereto to respect and ensure respect for their obligations under 

those instruments in all circumstances;  

 4. Determines once more that the continued occupation of the Syrian Golan 

and its de facto annexation constitute a stumbling block in the way of achieving a 

just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region;  

 5. Calls upon Israel to resume the talks on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks 

and to respect the commitments and undertakings reached during the previous talks; 

 6. Demands once more that Israel withdraw from all the occupied Syrian 

Golan to the line of 4 June 1967 in implementation of the relevant Security Council 

resolutions; 

 7. Calls upon all the parties concerned, the co-sponsors of the peace 

process and the entire international community to exert all the necessary efforts to 

ensure the resumption of the peace process and its success by implementing 

Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973); 

 8. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its 

seventy-second session on the implementation of the present resolution.
