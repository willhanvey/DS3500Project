draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions concerning the situation in Somalia, 
especially resolutions 1918 (2010) and 1950 (2010), 

 Continuing to be gravely concerned by the growing threat that piracy and 
armed robbery at sea against vessels pose to the situation in Somalia and other 
States in the region, as well as to international navigation, the safety of commercial 
maritime routes and the safety of seafarers and other persons, and also gravely 
concerned by the increased level of violence employed by pirates and persons 
involved in armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, 

 Strongly condemning the growing practice of hostage-taking by pirates 
operating off the coast of Somalia, expressing serious concern at the inhuman 
conditions hostage face in captivity, recognizing the adverse impact on their 
families, calling for the immediate release of all hostages, and noting the 
importance of cooperation between Member States on the issue of hostage-taking, 

 Emphasizing the importance of finding a comprehensive solution to the 
problem of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, 

 Stressing the need to build Somalia’s potential for sustainable economic 
growth as a means to tackle the underlying causes of piracy, including poverty, thus 
contributing to a durable eradication of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast 
of Somalia and illegal activities connected therewith,  

 Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political 
independence and unity of Somalia, including Somalia’s rights with respect to 
offshore natural resources, including fisheries, in accordance with international law, 
recalling the importance of preventing, in accordance with international law, illegal 
fishing and illegal dumping, including of toxic substances, and stressing the need to 
investigate allegations of such illegal fishing and dumping,  

 Being concerned at the same time that allegations of illegal fishing and 
dumping of toxic waste in Somali waters have been used by pirates in an attempt to 
justify their criminal activities, 

 Reaffirming that international law, as reflected in the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (Convention), in particular 



S/2011/228  
 

11-29538 2 
 

its articles 100, 101 and 105, sets out the legal framework applicable to combating 
piracy and armed robbery at sea, as well as other ocean activities, 

 Further reaffirming that the provisions of this resolution apply only with 
respect to the situation in Somalia and do not affect the rights and obligations or 
responsibilities of Member States under international law; 

 Reiterating its call upon States and regional organizations that have the 
capacity to do so, to take part in the fight against piracy and armed robbery at sea 
off the coast of Somalia, in particular, consistent with resolution 1950 (2010) and 
applicable international law, including human rights law, by deploying naval 
vessels, arms and military aircraft and through seizures and disposition of boats, 
vessels, arms and other related equipment used in the commission of piracy and 
armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, or for which there are reasonable 
grounds for suspecting such use,  

 Underlining the importance of enhancing ongoing work to address the 
problems caused by the limited capacity of the judicial system of Somalia and other 
States in the region to effectively prosecute suspected pirates, 

 Noting with appreciation the assistance being provided by the United Nations, 
including its Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and other international 
organizations and donors, in coordination with the Contact Group on Piracy off the 
Coast of Somalia (CGPCS), to enhance the capacity of the judicial and the 
corrections systems in Somalia, Kenya, Seychelles and other States in the region to 
prosecute suspected, and imprison convicted, pirates consistent with applicable 
international human rights law,  

 Commending those States that have amended their domestic law in order to 
criminalize piracy and facilitate the prosecution of suspected pirates in their national 
courts, consistent with applicable international law, including human rights law, and 
stressing the need for States to continue their efforts in this regard,  

 Noting with concern at the same time that the domestic law of a number of 
States lacks provisions criminalizing piracy and/or procedural provisions for 
effective criminal prosecution of suspected pirates,  

 Further expressing concern over a large number of persons suspected of piracy 
having to be released without facing justice, reaffirming that the failure to prosecute 
persons responsible for acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of 
Somalia undermines anti-piracy efforts of the international community and being 
determined to create conditions to ensure that pirates are held accountable, 

 Recognizing the urgent need to undertake decisive further steps to boost anti-
piracy efforts, 

 Expressing its gratitude for the work done by the Special Adviser to the 
Secretary-General on Legal Issues Related to Piracy off the Coast of Somalia Mr. 
Jack Lang in order to explore new solutions to counter more effectively piracy and 
armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, including by more effective 
prosecution of suspected, and imprisonment of convicted pirates, and noting with 
appreciation the conclusions and proposals set forth in his report to the Security 
Council contained in the annex to document S/2011/30, 



 S/2011/228
