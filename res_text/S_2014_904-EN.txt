  Russian Federation and United States of America: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Noting with concern that the situation in the Middle East is tense and is likely 

to remain so, unless and until a comprehensive settlement covering all aspects  of the 

Middle East problem can be reached, 

 Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations 

Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) of 28 November 2014 (S/2014/859), and 

also reaffirming its resolution 1308 (2000) of 17 July 2000,  

 Stressing that both parties must abide by the terms of the 1974 Disengagement 

of Forces Agreement between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic and scrupulously 

observe the ceasefire,  

 Concurring with the Secretary-General’s findings that the ongoing military 

activities conducted by any actor in the area of separation continue to have the 

potential to escalate tensions between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic, 

jeopardize the ceasefire between the two countries, and pose a risk to the local 

civilian population and United Nations personnel on the ground,  

 Expressing grave concern at all violations of the Disengagement of Forces 

Agreement,  

 Stressing that there should be no military forces in the area of separation other 

than those of UNDOF,  

 Strongly condemning the recent intense fighting in the area of separation, 

calling on all parties to the Syrian domestic conflict to cease military actions in the 

UNDOF area of operation and to respect international humani tarian law, and further 

condemning the use by armed Syrian extremist groups of improvised explosive 

devices in the UNDOF area of operation,  

 Condemning the use of heavy weapons by both the Syrian armed forces and 

armed groups in the ongoing Syrian conflict in the area of separation, including the 

use of tanks by the Syrian armed forces and opposition during clashes,  

 Echoing the Secretary-General’s call upon all parties to the Syrian domestic 

conflict to cease military actions throughout the country, including in the UNDOF 

area of operation,  

 Strongly condemning the incidents threatening the safety and security of 

United Nations personnel in recent months, including the detention of 45 UNDOF

peacekeepers by the Al-Nusra Front, stressing that there can never be any 

justification for these attacks on and detention of UN peacekeepers, and 

emphasizing the need to hold those responsible accountable,  

 Reaffirming its readiness to consider listing individuals, groups, undertakings, 

and entities providing support to ISIL or to the Al-Nusra Front, including those who 

are financing, arming, planning, or recruiting for ISIL or the Al -Nusra Front and all 

other individuals, groups, undertakings, and entities associated with Al -Qaida under 

the 1267/1989 (Al-Qaida) sanctions regime, including those participating in or 

otherwise supporting attacks against UN peacekeepers,  

 Recognizing the necessity of efforts to flexibly adjust UNDOF’s posture on a 

temporary basis to minimize the security risk to UN personnel as UNDOF continues 

to implement its mandate, while emphasizing that the ultimate goal is for the 

peacekeepers to return to their positions in UNDOF’s area of operations as soon as 

practicable, 

 Underscoring the need for UNDOF to have at its disposal all necessary means 

and resources to carry out its mandate safely and securely, and recalling that the 

theft of United Nations weapons and ammunition, vehicles and other assets, and the 

looting and destruction of United Nations facilities, are unacceptable,  

 Expressing its profound appreciation to UNDOF’s military and civilian 

personnel, including those from Observer Group Golan, for their service and 

continued contribution, in an increasingly challenging operating environment, 

underscoring the important contribution UNDOF’s continued presence makes to 

peace and security in the Middle East, welcoming steps taken to enhance the safety 

and security of UNDOF, including Observer Group Golan, personnel, and stressing 

the need for continued vigilance to ensure the safety and security of UNDOF and 

Observer Group Golan personnel, 

 1. Calls upon the parties concerned to implement immediately its resolution 

338 (1973) of 22 October 1973;  

 2. Stresses the obligation on both parties to scrupulously and fully respect 

the terms of the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement, calls on the parties to

in the area of separation, including military operations by the Syrian Arab Armed 

Forces; 

 3. Underlines that there should be no military activity of the armed 

opposition groups in the area of separation, and urges Member States to convey 

strongly to the Syrian armed opposition groups in UNDOF’s area of operation to 

halt all activities that endanger United Nations peacekeepers on the ground and to 

accord the United Nations personnel on the ground the freedom to carry out their 

mandate safely and securely; 

 4. Calls on all groups other than UNDOF to abandon all UNDOF positions 

and the Quneitra crossing point, and return the peacekeepers’ vehicles, weapons, 

and other equipment; 

 5. Calls on all parties to cooperate fully with the operations of UNDOF, to 

respect its privileges and immunities and to ensure its freedom of movement, as

impede UNDOF’s ability to fulfil its mandate;  

 6. Welcomes the efforts being undertaken by the United Nations

personnel with the United Nations code of conduct, requests the Secretary-General 

to continue to take all necessary action in this regard and to keep the Security 

Council informed, and urges troop-contributing countries to take preventive and 

disciplinary action to ensure that such acts are properly investigated and punished in 

cases involving their personnel; 

 7. Decides to renew the mandate of the United Nations Disengagement 

Observer Force for a period of six months, that is, until 30 June 2015, and requests

resources to fulfil the mandate in a safe and secure way;
