Deeply concerned also at the continued deadlock in achieving a

2. Expresses its concern at the failure of the parties to conclude, after
bilateral contacts and the Athens meeting of 16-18 October 1998 on confidence-

led peace process, continue to seek and engage in dialogue, expand their
contacts at all levels and display without delay the necessary will to achieve
substantial results on the key issues of the negotiations, and underlines the

settlement, which includes a settlement on the political status of Abkhazia
within the State of Georgia, which fully respects the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally recognized borders;

4. Emphasizes, in this context, that the readiness and ability of the

and his Special Representative with the assistance of the Russian Federation in

and willingness to make the Joint Investigation Group functional;

7. Expresses its continuing concern at the situation of refugees and
displaced persons, resulting most recently from the hostilities of May 1998,

affected by the conflict to return to their homes in secure conditions in
accordance with international law and as set out in the Quadripartite Agreement
of 4 April 1994 on the voluntary return of refugees and displaced persons

situation in the Gali region, and deplores the lack of serious efforts made by
the parties to bring an end to those activities;

measures to put a stop to such acts and ensure that the security environment of

taken in this regard;
