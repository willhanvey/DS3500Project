provide adequate and timely support for the DDR of eligible former combatants, 

through tailored, community-based and context specific DDR initiatives with

lessons from previous approaches, and ensuring that accountability and the protection

transformative strategy to lay the foundations for durable peace and inclusive 

development and the importance of tangible regional cooperation initiatives, further 

recalls the assessment made by the review that an absolute minimum transition period 

of three years is required, that the achievement of this timeline would require the 

implementation of the Government of the DRC’s announced reforms to address the 

structural drivers of conflict, and that this tentative timeline would have to remain 

flexible and to take into account the security situation based on ongoing assessments, 

as well as the red lines set out in the review justifying a pause in the transition;
