 Reaffirming the resolution on the Middle East adopted on 11 May 1995 by the 
1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty,2 in which the 
Conference reaffirmed the importance of the early realization of universal adherence 
to the Treaty and placement of nuclear facilities under full-scope International 
Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, 

 Reaffirming also its resolution 55/33 D of 20 November 2000, in which the 
General Assembly welcomed the adoption by consensus on 19 May 2000 of the 
Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,3 including, in particular, the documents 
entitled “Review of the operation of the Treaty, taking into account the decisions 
and the resolution adopted by the 1995 Review and Extension Conference” and 
“Improving the effectiveness of the strengthened review process for the Treaty”,4 

 Taking into consideration the unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon 
States, in the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the 
Treaty, to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to 
nuclear disarmament, to which all States parties to the Treaty are committed under 
article VI of the Treaty, 

 Gravely concerned over the failure of the 2005 Review Conference of the 
Parties to the Treaty to reach any substantive agreement on the follow-up to the 
nuclear disarmament obligations,  

 Noting with satisfaction that the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 Review 
Conference of the Parties to the Treaty finalized the procedural arrangements for the 
Review Conference, 

 1. Determines to pursue practical steps for systematic and progressive 
efforts to implement article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons1 and paragraphs 3 and 4 (c) of the decision on principles and objectives for 
nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament of the 1995 Review and Extension 
Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons;2 

 2. Calls for practical steps, as agreed to at the 2000 Review Conference of 
the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to be taken 
by all nuclear-weapon States that would lead to nuclear disarmament in a way that 
promotes international stability and, based upon the principle of undiminished 
security for all, for: 

 (a) Further efforts to be made by the nuclear-weapon States to reduce their 
nuclear arsenals unilaterally; 

 (b) Increased transparency by the nuclear-weapon States with regard to 
nuclear weapons capabilities and the implementation of agreements pursuant to 
article VI of the Treaty and as a voluntary confidence-building measure to support 
further progress in nuclear disarmament;

 (c) The further reduction of non-strategic nuclear weapons, based on 
unilateral initiatives and as an integral part of the nuclear arms reduction and 
disarmament process; 

 (d) Concrete agreed measures to reduce further the operational status of 
nuclear weapons systems; 

 (e) A diminishing role for nuclear weapons in security policies so as to 
minimize the risk that these weapons will ever be used and to facilitate the process 
of their total elimination; 

 (f) The engagement, as soon as appropriate, of all the nuclear-weapon States 
in the process leading to the total elimination of their nuclear weapons; 

 3. Notes that the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty 
agreed that legally binding security assurances by the five nuclear-weapon States to 
the non-nuclear-weapon States parties to the Treaty strengthen the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime; 

 4. Urges the States parties to the Treaty to follow up on the implementation 
of the nuclear disarmament obligations under the Treaty agreed to at the 1995 and 
2000 Review Conferences of the Parties to the Treaty within the framework of 
Review Conferences of the Parties to the Treaty and their Preparatory Committees; 

 5. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-sixth session an 
item entitled “Follow-up to nuclear disarmament obligations agreed to at the 1995 
and 2000 Review Conferences of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons”.
