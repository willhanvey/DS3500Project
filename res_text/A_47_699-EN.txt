the following draft resolutions:

A

Review of the implementation of the Declaration on
the Strengthening of International Security

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolution 2734 (XXV) of 16 December 1970 on the
Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security, as .well as all its
resolutions on the review of the implementation of the Declaration on the

Bearing in mind the final documents of the Tenth Conference of Heads of
State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Jakarta from 1 to
6 September 1992, 1/

Expressing its firm belief that disarmament, the relaxation of
international tension, respect for international law and for the purposes and
principles of the Charter of the United Nations, especially the principles of
the sovereign equality of States and the peaceful settlement of disputes and
the injunction to refrain from the use or threat of use of force in
international relations, respect for the right to self-determination and
national independence, economic and social development, the eradication of all
forms of domination and respect for basic human rights and fundamental
freedoms, as well as the need for preserving the environment, are closely
related and provide the basis for an enduring and stable universal peace and
security,

Welcoming the recent positive changes in the international landscape,
characterized by the end of the cold war, the relaxation of tensions on the
global level and the emergence of a new spirit governing relations among
nations,

Welcoming also the wide-ranging dialogue between the Russian Federation
and the United States of America, with its positive effects on world
developments, and expressing its hope that these developments will lead to the
renunciation of strategic doctrines based on the use of nuclear weapons and to
the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, thereby making a real
contribution to global security,

international security is established, peace, the achievement of disarmamen

force, aggression, intervention, interference, all forms of terrorism,

natural resources;
