  United States of America: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming all previous resolutions and Presidential statements concerning the 

situation in Abyei and along the border between Sudan and South Sudan and 

underlining the importance of full compliance with and implementation of these,  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 

territorial integrity of Sudan and South Sudan, and to the purposes and the principles 

of the Charter of the United Nations, and recalling the importance of the principles of 

good neighbourliness, non-interference and regional cooperation, 

 Reiterating that the territorial boundaries of States shall not be altered by force, 

and that any territorial disputes shall be settled exclusively by peaceful means, 

affirming the priority it attaches to the full and urgent implementation of all 

outstanding issues from the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), and 

underscoring that the future status of Abyei shall be resolved by negotiations between 

the parties in a manner consistent with the CPA and not by the unilateral actions of 

either party, 

 Underscoring that continued cooperation between the Government of the 

Republic of the Sudan and Government of the Republic of South Sudan is critical for 

peace, security and stability and the future relations between them, encouraging 

progress on improving bilateral relations and holding regular meetings of the Joint 

Political and Security Mechanism (JPSM) and other joint mechanisms, and calling on 

both governments to implement prior agreements,  

 Commending the continued assistance provided to the parties by the African 

Union (AU), the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the Federal 

Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the 

Horn of Africa, and the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA), 

 Acknowledging that over the course of the eight years since establishment of 

UNISFA the mission has contributed towards the stabilization and demilitarization of 

the Abyei Area and together with the Joint Border Verification and Monitori ng 

Mechanism (JBVMM) played a stabilizing role along the borders between South 

Sudan and Sudan, and taking note of the need to reconfigure the mission to create the 

space for a viable political process that would also serve as an exit strategy,  

 Underlining that over the course of eight years the Government of Sudan and 

the Government of South Sudan have not made meaningful progress on the political 

process including failure to establish joint institutions in Abyei,  



S/2019/879 
 

 

19-19743 2/7 

 

 Expressing concern that the delayed full deployment of UN police to the level 

authorized by the Council prevents UNISFA from fulfilling its security mandate and 

holds the potential to create a security vacuum in Abyei, and further expressing 

concern about Sudan and South Sudan’s efforts to impede UNISFA from fully 

executing its mandate, including by withholding visas for police, blocking 

appointment of a civilian Deputy Head of Mission and denying access to Athony 

airport, which would ease UNISFA’s logistical challenges, reduce transport costs, and 

enhance safety and security for UNISFA personnel,  

 Commending the efforts of UNISFA, notwithstanding the impediments referred 

to in the previous paragraph, in its attempts to carry out its mandate effectively, 

including by its ongoing facilitation of peaceful migration throughout the Abyei Area, 

conflict prevention, mediation and deterrence, and strongly underscoring the 

unacceptability of any attack on United Nations personnel, and reiterating that such 

attacks, which may constitute a war crime, should be swiftly and thoroughly 

investigated, and that those responsible should be held to account,  

 Recalling that the Secretary-General’s October 2019 Report on the situation in 

Abyei (S/2019/817) highlights the need for a UNISFA civilian Deputy Head of 

Mission,  

 Bearing in mind that people in the Abyei Area continue to rely on humanitarian 

assistance, recalling that floods in October 2019 displaced approximately 40,000 

people, that access for humanitarian organizations to reach people in need remains of 

crucial importance, and that humanitarian actors continue to provide assistance to 

182,000 people in the Abyei Area,  

 Recalling resolutions 1325 (2000) and subsequent resolutions on women, peace, 

and security and emphasizing that persistent barriers to full implementation of these 

resolutions will only be dismantled through dedicated commitment to women’s 

empowerment, participation, and human rights, and through concerted leadership, 

consistent information and action, and support,  

 Recognizing that the current situation in Abyei and along the border between 

Sudan and South Sudan continues to constitute a threat to international peace and 

security, 

 1. Decides to extend until 15 May 2020 the mandate of UNISFA as set out in 

paragraph 2 of resolution 1990 (2011) and acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of 

the United Nations, further decides to extend until 15 May 2020 the tasks of UNISFA 

as set out in paragraph 3 of resolution 1990 (2011); 

 2. Decides to extend until 15 May 2020 UNISFA’s mandate modification set 

forth in resolution 2024 (2011) and paragraph 1 of resolution 2075 (2012), which 

provides for UNISFA’s support to the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring 

Mechanism (JBVMM), and further decides that this shall be the final such extension 

unless the parties take the specific measures described in paragraph 3;  

 3. Determines that both parties should continue to demonstrate measurable 

progress on border demarcation, specifically by taking the measures listed below:  

  (1) UNISFA and JBVMM Patrols: Maintain standing clearance and 

achieve full freedom of movement for all air and ground patrols,  

  (2) JBVMM Team Sites: Support to establish and operate a fourth team 

site in Abu Qussa/Wunkur, 

  (3) JPSM: Convene two meetings of the Joint Political Security 

Mechanism (JPSM) that provide clear guidance to JBVMM, and ensure 

conclusions of meetings are widely disseminated,

providing effective law enforcement throughout the Abyei area;  

 6. Requests the Secretary-General to appoint a civilian Deputy Head of 

Mission for UNISFA and add additional civilian staff within existing resources to

and Security of the Abyei Area of June 2011, including agreement to establish the 

Abyei Police Service; 

 7. Demands that the Governments of Sudan and South Sudan provide full 

support to UNISFA in the deployment of UNISFA personnel, including by promptly

critical for the mandate of UNISFA, including police;  

 8. Urges that the Governments of Sudan and South Sudan facilitate basing 

arrangements for UNISFA in the Mission area including Athony airport, and provide 

necessary flight clearances, and notes that the utilization of Athony airport will reduce 

UNISFA’s transport costs and logistical challenges, facilitate MEDEVAC, official

safety and security for UNISFA personnel, and further calls upon all parties to fully 

adhere to their obligations under the Status of Forces Agreements;

Abyei Area and to achieve a political resolution to the status of Abyei, and requests 

the Secretary-General consult with the parties and the African Union related to:

S/2019/879 
 

 

19-19743 4/7

Demilitarized Border Zone (SDBZ) centreline on the ground, and reiterates that the 

centreline of the SDBZ in no way prejudices the current or future legal status of the

the borders;
