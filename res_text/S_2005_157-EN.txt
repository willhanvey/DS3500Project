Draft resolution

The Security Council,

Reaffirming all its previous resolutions and statements pertaining to the
situation between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and the requirements contained therein,
including in particular resolution 1560 (2004) of 14 September 2004,

Stressing its unwavering commitment to the peace process, including through
the role played by the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE),
and to the full and expeditious implementation of the Comprehensive peace
agreement signed by the Governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea (hereinafter referred
to as “the parties”) on 12 December 2000 and the preceding Agreement on the
Cessation of Hostilities of 18 June 2000 (S/2000/1183 and S/2000/601, respectively,
hereinafter referred to as the “Algiers Agreements”), and the delimitation decision
by the Boundary Commission of 13 April 2002 (S/2000/423), embraced by the
parties as final and binding in accordance with the Algiers Agreements,

Welcoming the Secretary-General’s determination that UNMEE has been able
to maintain the integrity of the Temporary Security Zone (TSZ),

Expressing concern regarding the recent high concentration of Ethiopian
troops in the areas adjacent to the TSZ,

Recalling that lasting peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea as well as in the
region cannot be achieved without the full demarcation of the border between the
parties,

Seriously concerned with the Commission’s decision to take immediate steps
to close down its field offices, due to the lack of progress made in the demarcation
of the border, as reflected in the 16th report on the work of the Eritrea-Ethiopia
Boundary Commission of 24 February 2005,

Expressing concern about Ethiopia’s ongoing rejection of significant parts of
the Boundary Commission’s decision, and its current lack of cooperation with the
Commission, including the refusal to participate in the meeting of 22 February
2005,

Expressing disappointment about the continuing refusal of Eritrea to engage
with the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Ethiopia and Eritrea, whose good
offices represent a concrete opportunity for both parties to move the peace process
forward,
