headings set out in the previous paragraph, as did the relevant report of the

Programme and Co-ordination at its seventeenth session and the second part of its

(A/C.5/33/38).

for Programme and Co-ordination involved the transfer of funds amounting to 
$275,900 from sections 50 and 21 to sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the programme budget 
for the biennium 1978-1979 with regard to transport programmes, which would 
inter alia, terminate the short-wave broadcasts and require that the United Nations 
Chronicle be issued on a quarterly basis instead of on a monthly basis releasing 
appropriations totalling $134,700 under section 21.

funds available for transfer by $32,700. 

25. Also at the same meeting, the representative of Kenya proposed that the 
Committee recommend to the General Assembly that it should request the Committee to 
Review United Nations Public Information Policies and Activities to make

programme budget for the biennium 1978-1979 in the amount of $243,200 to 
sections 7, 8, 9 and 10, as well as the increase of $2,000 for staff 
assessment under section 25, offset by the same amount under income section 1. 

"2. Request the Committee to Review United Nations Public Information
