Draft resolution

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its resolutions 827 (1993) of 25 May 1993, 955 (1994) of
8 November 1994, 1165 (1998) of 30 April 1998, 1166 (1998) of 13 May 1998 and
1329 (2000) of 30 November 2000,

Recognizing that persons who are nominated for, or who are elected or
appointed as, judges of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia or of
the International Tribunal for Rwanda may bear the nationalities of two or more
States,

Being aware that at least one such person has already been elected a judge of
one of the International Tribunals,

Considering that, for the purposes of membership of the Chambers of the
International Tribunals, such persons should be regarded as bearing solely the
nationality of the State in which they ordinarily exercise civil and political rights,

Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,

1. Decides to amend article 12 of the Statute of the International Tribunal
for the Former Yugoslavia and to replace that article with the provisions set out in
annex I to this resolution;

2. Decides also to amend article 11 of the Statute of the International
Tribunal for Rwanda and to replace that article with the provisions set out in
annex II to this resolution;

3. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
