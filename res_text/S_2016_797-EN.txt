draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming that terrorism in all forms and manifestations constitutes one of 

the most serious threats to international peace and security and that any acts of 

terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivations, whenever, 

wherever and by whomsoever committed, and remaining determined to contribute 

further to enhancing the effectiveness of the overall effort to fight this scourge on a 

global level,  

 Noting with concern that the terrorism threat has become more diffuse, with an 

increase, in various regions of the world, of terrorist acts including those motivated 

by intolerance or violent extremism, and expressing its determination to combat this 

threat,  

 Reaffirming its commitment to the sovereignty, including sovereignty over the 

airspace above a State’s territory, territorial integrity and political independence of 

all States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations,  

 Recognizing the vital importance of the global aviation system to economic 

development and prosperity, and of all States strengthening aviation security 

measures to secure a stable and peaceful global environment, and further 

recognizing that secure air services in this regard enhance transportation, 

connectivity, trade, political and cultural links between States, and that public 

confidence in the security of air transport is vital,  

 Noting that the global nature of aviation means that States are dependent on 

the effectiveness of each others’ aviation security systems for the protection of their 

citizens and nationals and relevant aspects of their national security, bearing in mind 

the common goal of the international community in this regard, which means States 

are dependent on each other to provide a common secure aviation environment,  



S/2016/797 
 

 

16-16415 2/5 

 

 Expressing concern that terrorist groups continue to view civil aviation as an 

attractive target, with the aim of causing substantial loss of life, economic damage 

and disruption to connectivity between States, and that the risk of terrorist attacks 

against civil aviation may affect all regions and Member States,  

 Expressing grave concern over terrorist attacks against civil aviation and 

strongly condemning such attacks, 

 Also expressing concern that civil aviation may be used as a transportation 

means by Foreign Terrorist Fighters, and noting in this regard that Annex 9 — 

Facilitation to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, done at Chicago on 

December 7, 1944 (the “Chicago Convention”) contains standards and 

recommended practices relevant to the detection and prevention of terrorist threats 

involving civil aviation, 

 Reaffirming that terrorist attacks against civil aviation, like any act of 

international terrorism, constitute a threat to international peace and security, and 

that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their 

motivations, whenever, wherever, and by whomsoever committed, and reaffirming 

the need to combat by all means threats to international peace and security caused 

by terrorist acts, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and other 

international law, in particular international human rights law, international refugee 

law, and international humanitarian law,  

 Expressing particular concern that terrorist groups are actively seeking ways to 

defeat or circumvent aviation security, looking to identify and exploit gaps or 

weaknesses where they perceive them, noting in this regard the high priority risk 

areas for aviation as identified by the Council of the International Civil Aviation 

Organization (ICAO), in its Global Risk Context Statement, and stressing the need 

for international aviation security measures to keep pace with the evolution of this 

threat, 

 Affirming the role of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as 

the United Nations organization responsible for developing international aviat ion 

security standards, monitoring their implementation by States and its role in 

assisting states in complying with these standards, noting in this regard ICAO’s “no 

country left behind” initiative, and noting also the adoption at the 37th Session of 

the ICAO Assembly in 2010 of the Declaration on Aviation Security and the ICAO 

Comprehensive Aviation Security Strategy, both of which have become key 

instruments of leadership and engagement for the Organization in carrying out its 

aviation security programme, and noting the intention to develop a Global Aviation 

Security Plan as the future global framework for progressive aviation security 

enhancement, 

 Noting that the protection of civil aviation from acts of unlawful interference 

is addressed by the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on 

Board Aircraft (Tokyo, 1963), by the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful 

Seizure of Aircraft (The Hague, 1970), by the Convention for the Suppression of 

Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation (Montréal, 1971), by the 

Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving 

International Civil Aviation, Supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression 

of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation (Montréal,  1988), by the 



 
S/2016/797 

 

3/5 16-16415 

 

Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection 

(Montréal, 1991), by the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating 

to International Civil Aviation (Beijing, 2010), by the Protocol Supplementary to the 

Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft (Beijing, 2010), by 

the Protocol to Amend the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts 

Committed on Board Aircraft (Montréal, 2014) and by bilateral agreements for the 

suppression of such acts,  

 Reaffirming its call upon all States to become party to the relevant 

international counter-terrorism conventions and protocols as soon as possible, 

whether or not they are a party to regional conventions on the matter, and to fully 

implement their obligations under those to which they are a party,  

 1. Affirms that all States have the responsibility to protect the security of 

citizens and nationals of all nations against terrorist attacks on air services operating 

within their territory, in a manner consistent with existing obligations under 

international law; 

 2. Affirms also that all States have an interest to protect the safety of their 

own citizens and nationals against terrorist attacks conducted against international 

civil aviation, wherever these may occur, in accordance with international law, 

including international human rights law and international humanitarian law;  

 3. Notes that Annex 17 — Security to the Convention on International Civil 

Aviation, done at Chicago on December 7, 1944 (the “Chicago Conventio n”), 

provides that contracting States shall develop and implement regulations, practices, 

and procedures to safeguard civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference and 

to ensure that such measures are capable of responding rapidly to meet any 

increased security threat, and further notes that Annex 17 to the Chicago Convention 

establishes additional standards to safeguard international civil aviation against 

unlawful interference, to which contracting States shall conform in accordance with 

the Chicago Convention, and that Annex 17 to the Chicago Convention also 

provides recommended practices, and that both standards and recommended 

practices are supported by detailed guidance on their effective implementation;  

 4. Welcomes and supports the work of ICAO to ensure that all such 

measures are continuously reviewed and adapted to meet the ever -evolving global 

threat picture, and calls upon ICAO, within its mandate, to continue and enhance its 

efforts to establish compliance with international aviation secur ity standards 

through effective implementation on the ground, and to assist Member States in this 

regard; 

 5. Calls upon all States to work within ICAO to ensure that its international 

security standards are reviewed and adapted to effectively address the threat posed 

by terrorist targeting of civil aviation, to strengthen and promote the effective 

application of ICAO standards and recommended practices in Annex 17, and to 

assist ICAO to continue to enhance audit, capacity development and training 

programmes in order to support their implementation;  

 6. Further calls upon all States, as part of their efforts to prevent and 

counter terrorist threats to civil aviation and acting consistent with relevant 

international legal instruments and framework documents,  to:
