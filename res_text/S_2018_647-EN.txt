  Russian Federation and United States of America: 

draft resolution  
 

 

  The Security Council, 

  Noting with concern that the situation in the Middle East is tense and is 

likely to remain so, unless and until a comprehensive settlement covering all 

aspects of the Middle East problem can be reached,  

  Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations 

Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) of 11 June 2018 (S/2018/550) and also 

reaffirming its resolution 1308 (2000) of 17 July 2000, 

  Stressing that both parties must abide by the terms of the 1974 

Disengagement of Forces Agreement between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic 

and scrupulously observe the ceasefire,  

  Concurring with the Secretary-General’s findings that the ongoing military 

activities conducted by any actor in the area of separation continue to have the 

potential to escalate tensions between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic, 

jeopardize the ceasefire between the two countries, and pose a risk to the local 

civilian population and United Nations personnel on the ground,  

  Expressing alarm that recent escalation of violence in the Syrian Arab 

Republic risks a serious conflagration of the conflict in the region  

  Expressing grave concern at all violations of the Disengagement of Forces 

Agreement, 

  Stressing that there should be no military forces in the area of separat ion 

other than those of UNDOF, 

  Strongly condemning the continued fighting in the area of separation, calling 

on all parties to the Syrian domestic conflict to cease military actions in the 

UNDOF area of operations and to respect international humanitarian law, 

  Condemning the use of heavy weapons by both the Syrian armed forces and 

armed groups in the ongoing Syrian conflict in the area of separation, including 

the use of tanks by the Syrian armed forces and opposition during clashes,  

  Echoing the Secretary-General’s call upon all parties to the Syrian domestic 

conflict to cease military actions throughout the country, including in the UNDOF 

area of operations, 

  Reaffirming its readiness to consider listing individuals, groups, 

undertakings, and entities providing support to the Islamic State in Iraq and the 

Levant (ISIL, also known as Da’esh) or to the Al-Nusra Front (also known as 

Jabhat Fateh al-Sham), including those who are financing, arming, planning, or 

recruiting for ISIL or the Al-Nusra Front and all other individuals, groups, 

undertakings, and entities associated with ISIL and Al-Qaida as listed on the ISIL

(Da’esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions List, including those participating in or 

otherwise supporting attacks against UNDOF peacekeepers,  

  Recognizing the necessity of efforts to flexibly adjust UNDOF’s posture on 

a temporary basis to minimize the security risk to UNDOF personnel as UNDOF 

continues to implement its mandate, while emphasizing that the ultimate goal is 

for the peacekeepers to return to their positions in UNDOF’s area of operations 

as soon as practicable,  

  Emphasizing the importance of Security Council and troop-contributing 

countries having access to reports and information related to UNDOF ’s current 

temporary configuration, and reinforcing that such information assists the 

Security Council with evaluating, mandating, and reviewing UNDOF and with 

effective consultation with troop-contributing countries, 

  Underscoring the need for UNDOF to have at its disposal all necessary 

means and resources to carry out its mandate safely and securely, including 

technology and equipment to enhance its observation of the area of separation and 

the ceasefire line, and to improve force protection, as appropriate, and recalling 

that the theft of United Nations weapons and ammunition, vehicles and other 

assets, and the looting and destruction of United Nations facilities, are 

unacceptable, 

  Expressing its profound appreciation to UNDOF’s military and civilian 

personnel, including those from Observer Group Golan, for their service in an 

increasingly challenging operating environment, underscoring the important 

contribution UNDOF’s continued presence makes to peace and security in the 

Middle East, welcoming steps taken to enhance the safety and security of UNDOF, 

including Observer Group Golan, personnel, and stressing the need for continued 

vigilance to ensure the safety and security of UNDOF and Observer Group Golan 

personnel, 

  Strongly condemning incidents threatening the safety and security of United 

Nations personnel, 

  Expressing its appreciation to UNDOF, including Observer Group Golan, 

for the ongoing efforts made towards the reestablishment of its headquarters at 

Camp Faouar and limited patrolling in its vicinity, and to upgrade and expand its 

positions on Mount Hermon, including the establishment of new positions,  

  Taking note of the Secretary-General’s plan for UNDOF to return to vacated 

positions on the Bravo side based on a continuous assessment of security in the 

area of separation and its surroundings, and continued discussion and 

coordination with the parties, 

  Recalls that UNDOF’s deployment and the 1974 Disengagement of Forces 

Agreement are steps toward a just and durable peace on the basis of Security 

Council Resolution 338 (1973), 

  Recalling its request of the Secretary-General to ensure that data related to 

the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations, including peacekeeping 

performance data, is used to improve analytics and the evaluation of mission 

operations, based on clear and well identified benchmarks,  

  Recalling resolution 2242 (2015) and its aspiration to increase the number 

of women in military and police contingents of United Nations peacekeeping 

operations, 

  1. Calls upon the parties concerned to implement immediately its 

resolution 338 (1973) of 22 October 1973; 

  2. Stresses the obligation on both parties to scrupulously and fully respect
