14-64954 2/3 

 

on the question of a moratorium on the use of the death penalty, in which the 

General Assembly called upon States that still maintain the death penalty to 

establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing it,   

 Welcoming all relevant Human Rights Council decisions and resolutions,   

 Mindful that any miscarriage or failure of justice in the implementation of the 

death penalty is irreversible and irreparable,  

 Convinced that a moratorium on the use of the death penalty contributes to 

respect for human dignity and to the enhancement and progressive development of 

human rights, and considering that there is no conclusive evidence of the deterrent 

value of the death penalty,  

 Noting ongoing local and national debates and regional initiatives on the death 

penalty, as well as the readiness of an increasing number of Member States to make 

available to the public information on the use of the death penalty, and also, in this 

regard, the decision by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 26/2 of 26 June 

20144 to convene biennial high-level panel discussions in order to further exchange 

views on the question of the death penalty,  

 Recalling the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil 

and Political Rights,5 aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, and in this regard 

welcoming the increasing number of accessions to and ratifications of the Second 

Optional Protocol,  

 Noting the technical cooperation among Member States, as well as the role of 

relevant United Nations entities and human rights mechanisms in supporting State 

efforts to establish moratoriums on the death penalty,  

 1. Expresses its deep concern about the continued application of the death 

penalty;  

 2. Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of 

resolution 67/1766 and the recommendations contained therein;  

 3. Also welcomes the steps taken by some States to reduce the number of 

offences for which the death penalty may be imposed, as well as steps taken to l imit 

its application;  

 4. Further welcomes the decisions made by an increasing number of States, 

at all levels of government, to apply a moratorium on executions, followed in many 

cases by the abolition of the death penalty;  

 5. Calls upon all States:  

 (a) To respect international standards that provide safeguards guaranteeing 

protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, in particular the minimum 

standards, as set out in the annex to Economic and Social Council resolution 

1984/50 of 25 May 1984, as well as to provide the Secretary-General with 

information in this regard;

Convention on Consular Relations,7 particularly the right to receive information on 

consular assistance within the context of a legal procedure;  

 (c) To make available relevant information, disaggregated by applicable 

criteria, with regard to their use of the death penalty, inter alia, the number of 

persons sentenced to death, the number of persons on death row and the number of 

executions carried out, which can contribute to possible informed and transparent 

national and international debates, including on the obligations of States pertaining 

to the use of the death penalty;  

 (d) To progressively restrict the use of the death penalty and not to impose 

capital punishment for offences committed by persons below 18 years of age, on 

pregnant women and on persons with mental or intellectual disabilities;   

 (e) To reduce the number of offences for which the death penalty may be 

imposed;  

 (f) To establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the 

death penalty;

reintroduce it, and encourages them to share their experience in  this regard;  

 7. Calls upon States that have not yet done so to consider acceding to or 

ratifying the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 

Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty;5
 
 

 8. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its 

seventy-first session on the implementation of the present resolution;   

 9. Decides to continue consideration of the matter at its seventy-first 

session under the item entitled “Promotion and protection of human rights”.
