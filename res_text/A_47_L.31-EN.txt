POLICIES OF APARTHEID OF THE GOVERNMENT OF SOUTH AFRICA

Algeria, Cuba, Indonesia, Kuwait, New Zealand, Nicaragua,
Nigeria, Norway, Ukraine and United Republic of T~nzania:

draft resolution

Oil embargo against South Africa

The General Assembly,

Having considered the report of the Intergovernmental Group to Monitor
the Supply and Shipping of Oil and Petroleum Products to South Africa, ~I

Recalling its resolutions on the oil embargo against South Africa, in
particular resolution 46/79 E of 13 December 1991,

Recognizing the importance of the oil embargo as a major contribution to
the pressure exerted on South Africa towards the eradication of apartheid
through negotiations, as well as the importance of maintaining pressure until
there is clear evidence of profound and irreversible changes, bearing in mind
the objectives of the Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive
Consequences in Southern Africa, ~I such as the adoption of a non-racial and
democratic constitution for a free South Africa,

Noting that the most effective oil embargo against South Africa remains
the adoption by the Security Council of a mandatory embargo,

~I Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-seventh Session,
Supplement No. 43 (A/47/23).

Noting with appreciation the draft model law for the effective
enforcement of the oil embargo against South Africa, contained in annex I of
the report of the Intergovernmental Group to the General Assembly at its
forty-fifth session, ~I and welcoming its consideration by Member States,

Concerned that the oil embargo against South Africa is still being
violated and that South Africa, because of loopholes in the embargo, such as
lack of effective legislation, has been able to acquire oil and petroleum
products,

Convinced that an effective oil embargo against South Africa would
contribute to the efforts of the international community to bring about a
negotiated settlement and the establishment of a united, non-racial and
democratic South Africa,

1. Takes note of the report of the Intergovernmental Group to Monitor
the Supply and Shipping of Oil and Petroleum Products to South Africa, £1 and
endorses its recommendations;

2. Reguests all States to adopt, if they have not already done so, and
otherwise to maintain and enforce effective measures prohibiting the supply
and shipping of oil and petroleum products to South Africa, whether directly
or indirectly, and in particular:

(a) To apply strictly the "end users" clause and otner conditions
concerning restriction on destination to ensure compliance with the embargo;

(b) To compel the companies originally selling or purchasing oil or
petroleum products, as appropriate to each nation, to desist from selling,
reselling or otherwise transferring oil and petroleum products to South
Africa, whether directly or indirectly;

(c) To establish strict control over the supply of oil and petroleum
products to South Africa by intermediaries, oil companies and traders by
placing responsibilities for the fulfilment of the contract on the first buyer
or seller of oil and petroleum products who would, therefore, be liable for
the actions of these parties;

(d) To prevent South African companies from acquiring holdings in oil
companies outside South Africa;

(e) To prohibit all assistance to South Africa in the oil.sector,
including finance, technology, equipment or personnel;

~I Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-fifth Session,
Supplement No. 43 (A/45/43).

(f) To prohibit the transport of oil and petrole~ products to South
Africa by ships flying their flags, or by ships that are ultimately owned,
managed or chartered by their nationals or by companies within their
jurisdiction;

(g) To develop a system for registration of ships, registered in their
States or owneq by their nationals, that have violated the oil embargo, and to
discourage such ships from calling at South African ports;

(h) To impose penal action against companies and individuals that have
been involved in violating the oil embargo, and to publicize cases of
successful prosecutions in conformity with their national laws;

(i) To gather, exchange and disseminate information regarding violations
of the oil embargo, including ways and means to prevent such violations, and
to take concerted measures against violators;

(j) To discourage ships within their jurisdiction from engaging in
activities that give rise to violation of the oil embargo against South
Africa, taking into account legislative and other measures already adopted;

3. Authorizes the Intergovernmental Group to take action to promote
public awareness of the oil embargo against South Africa, including, when
necessary, sending missions and participating in relevant conferences and
meetings;

4. Requests the Intergovernmental Group to submit to the General
Assembly at its forty-eighth session a report on the implementation of the
present resolution;

5. Requests all States to extend their cooperation to the
Intergovernmental Group with all necessary assistance for the implementation
of the present resolution•
