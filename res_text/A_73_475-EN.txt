  Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of 

Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized

 The General Assembly, 

 Having considered the item entitled “Implementation of the Declaration on the 

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized 

agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations”, 

 Having also considered the report of the Secretary-General1 and the report of 

the Economic and Social Council2 on the item, 

 Having examined the chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the 

Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of 

Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for 2018 relating to the item, 3 

 Recalling its resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 and 1541 (XV) of 

15 December 1960 and the resolutions of the Special Committee, as well as other 

relevant resolutions and decisions, including, in particular, Economic and Social 

Council resolutions 2016/20 of 27 July 2016 and 2017/31 of 25 July 2017, 

 Bearing in mind the relevant provisions of the final documents of the successive 

Conferences of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries and of the 

resolutions adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African

 Conscious of the need to facilitate the implementation of the Declaration on the 

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in resolution 

1514 (XV), 

 Noting that the large majority of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories 

are small island Territories, 

 Welcoming the assistance extended to Non-Self-Governing Territories by certain 

specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, in 

particular the United Nations Development Programme,  

 Welcoming also the participation in the capacity of observers of those Non-Self-

Governing Territories that are associate members of regional commissions in the

procedure of the General Assembly and in accordance with relevant resolutions and 

decisions of the United Nations, including resolutions and decisions of the Assembly

 Noting that only some specialized agencies and other organizations of the 

United Nations system have been involved in providing assistance to Non-Self-

Governing Territories, 

 Stressing that, because the development options of the small island Non-Self-

Governing Territories are limited, there are special challenges to planning for and 

implementing sustainable development and that those Territories will be constrained 

in meeting those challenges without the continuing cooperation and assistance of the 

specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system,  

 Stressing also the importance of securing the resources necessary for funding 

expanded programmes of assistance for the peoples concerned and the need to enlist 

the support of all major funding institutions within the United Nations system in that 

regard, 

 Reaffirming the mandates of the specialized agencies and other organizations of 

the United Nations system to take all appropriate measures, within their respective 

responsibilities, to ensure the full implementation of General Assembly resolution 

1514 (XV) and other relevant resolutions,  

 Expressing its appreciation to the African Union, the Pacific Islands Forum, the 

Caribbean Community and other regional organizations for the continued cooperation 

and assistance that they have extended to the specialized agencies and other 

organizations of the United Nations system in this regard,  

 Expressing its conviction that closer contacts and consultations between and 

among the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system 

and regional organizations help to facilitate the effective formulation of programmes 

of assistance to the peoples concerned,  

 Mindful of the imperative need to keep under continuous review the activities 

of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system in 

the implementation of the various resolutions and decisions of the United Nations 

relating to decolonization, 

 Bearing in mind the extremely fragile economies of the small island Non-Self-

Governing Territories and their vulnerability to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, 

cyclones and sea level rise, and recalling the relevant resolutions of the General 

Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 72/93 of 7 December 2017 on the implementation of the 

Declaration by the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated 

with the United Nations, 

 Welcoming the participation by videoconference of representatives of the United 

Nations Development Programme and the Economic Commission for Latin America 

and the Caribbean at the Pacific regional seminar held in Saint George ’s from 9 to 

11 May 2018, and encouraging further participation by specialized agencies and 

institutions associated with the United Nations in the future regional seminars of the 

Special Committee, 

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;1 

 2. Recommends that all States intensify their efforts through the specialized 

agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system of which they are

Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), and other relevant resolutions of the United Nations;

 4. Also reaffirms that the recognition by the General Assembly, the Security 

Council and other United Nations organs of the legitimacy of the aspirations of the 

peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories to exercise their right to self-

determination entails, as a corollary, the extension of all appropriate assistance to 

those peoples; 

 5. Expresses its appreciation to those specialized agencies and other 

organizations of the United Nations system that have continued to cooperate with the 

United Nations and the regional and subregional organizations in the implementation

of the United Nations system and regional organizations to strengthen existing
