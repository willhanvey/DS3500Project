reclamation activities that are carried out in a manner that has a detrimental impact 
on the marine environment, 

 Noting the ministerial meeting of the Commission for the Protection of the 
Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, held in Bergen, Norway, from 20 to 
24 September 2010, 

 Reiterating its serious concern at the current and projected adverse effects of 
climate change on the marine environment and marine biodiversity, and 
emphasizing the urgency of addressing this issue, 

 Expressing concern that climate change continues to increase the severity and 
incidence of coral bleaching throughout tropical seas and weakens the ability of 
reefs to withstand ocean acidification, which could have serious and irreversible 
negative effects on marine organisms, particularly corals, as well as to withstand 
other pressures, including overfishing and pollution, 

 Reiterating its deep concern at the vulnerability of the environment and the 
fragile ecosystems of the polar regions, including the Arctic Ocean and the Arctic
