 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its resolutions and the statements of its President concerning the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, in particular resolution 1843 (2008) and 
resolution 1794 (2007) and the statements of its President dated 29 October 2008 
(S/PRST/2008/40) and 21 October 2008 (S/PRST/2008/38), 

 Reaffirming its commitment to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and 
political independence of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 

 Stressing the primary responsibility of the Government of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo for ensuring security in its territory and protecting its 
civilians with respect for the rule of law, human rights and international 
humanitarian law, 

 Condemning the Congrès national pour la Défense du people (CNDP) repeated 
offensive military actions in the past months, which have caused massive 
displacement of populations in North Kivu as well as cross-border movements of 
refugees and which have also involved the PARECO and other illegal armed groups, 
and condemning also the attacks by the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) in the 
Orientale Province, as well as the resumption of hostilities by illegal armed groups 
in Ituri, 

 Underlining that a major obstacle to lasting peace in the Kivus is the presence 
and activities of illegal armed groups on Congolese territory, including the Forces 
Démocratiques de Libération du Rwanda (FDLR) as acknowledged by its resolution 
1804 (2008), which represent one of the primary causes for the conflict in the 
region, 

 Taking note of the final declaration of the Nairobi summit organized on 
7 November 2008 by President Mwai Kibaki, acting Chairman of the International 
Conference on the Great Lakes region, and President Jakaya Kikwete, President-in-
office of the African Union, and the communiqué of the extraordinary summit of the 
SADC Heads of State and Government held in Sandton on 9 November 2008, 
welcoming the appointment of facilitators including the Special Envoy of the 
Secretary-General for the Great Lakes region, former Nigerian President Olusegun 
Obasanjo, and the former President of the United Republic of Tanzania, Benjamin

Congo, and act to assist efforts to resolve the conflict, 

 Recalling the joint communiqué of the Government of the Democratic 
Republic of Congo and the Government of the Republic of Rwanda signed in 
Nairobi on 9 November 2007 and the Acte d’engagement which emerged from the 
Conference for Peace, Security and Development in North and South Kivu, held in 
Goma from 6 to 23 January 2008, and reaffirming that the Goma and Nairobi 
processes are the appropriate framework for stabilising the situation in the eastern 
part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 

 Emphasizing the responsibility of the Government of the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo and the Governments of the region to prevent the use of their 
respective territories in support of violations of the arms embargo imposed by 
resolution 1807 (2008) or in support of activities of armed groups present in the 
region in accordance with the Pact on Security, Stability and Development for the 
Great Lakes Region and urging them to take effective measures to prevent cross-
border support to any illegal armed group in the eastern region of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, and welcoming the progress made in high-level bilateral 
talks between the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 
Rwanda, 

 Recalling also the importance of urgently carrying out comprehensive and 
lasting security sector reform and of permanently disarming, demobilizing, 
resettling or repatriating, as appropriate, and reintegrating Congolese and foreign 
armed groups for the long-term stabilization of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, and the contribution made by international partners in this field, 

 Recognizing the link between the illegal exploitation of natural resources, the 
illicit trade in such resources and the proliferation and trafficking of arms as one of 
the major factors fuelling and exacerbating conflicts in the Great Lakes region of 
Africa, and in particular in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 

 Expressing its extreme concern at the deteriorating humanitarian and human 
rights situation, condemning in particular the targeted attacks against the civilian 
population, sexual violence, recruitment of child soldiers and summary executions, 
and stressing the urgent need for the Government of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, in cooperation with the United Nations Organization Mission in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and other relevant actors, to end 
those violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, in particular 
those carried out by the militias and armed groups and by elements of the Armed 
Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC), the Congolese National 
Police (PNC) and other security and intelligence services, and to bring the 
perpetrators, as well as the senior commanders under whom they serve, to justice, 
and calling on Member States to assist in this regard and to continue to provide 
medical, humanitarian and other assistance to victims, 

 Recalling its resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) on women, peace and

 Underscoring the long-term, sustainable efforts needed from the Government

consolidate democracy and promote the rule of law, good governance, recovery and 
development, 

 Expressing its full support for MONUC, condemning all attacks against United 
Nations peacekeepers and humanitarian personnel, regardless of their perpetrators, 
and emphasizing that those responsible for such attacks must be brought to justice, 

 Recalling that the temporary increase of MONUC’s capacities authorized by 
its resolution 1843 (2008) aims at enabling MONUC to reorganize, and in particular 
reconfigure its structure and forces and optimize their deployment, allowing the 
constitution of a quick-reaction capability to provide greater flexibility to deploy as 
needed to strengthen efforts to protect civilians and provide additional security in 
the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 

 Recognizing that effective coordination between the Government of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo and MONUC on security matters in the areas of
