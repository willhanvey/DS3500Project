 Recalling the three Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial

Programmes of Action for those Decades were not fully implemented and that their 

objectives have yet to be attained,  

 Reiterating that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights 

and have the potential to contribute constructively to the development and well -

being of their societies, and that any doctrine of racial superiority is scientifically 

false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and must be rejected,

races,

slave trade, including the transatlantic slave trade, and the associated historical 

injustices, as well as the untold suffering caused by colonialism and apartheid, and

indigenous peoples continue to be victims, and acknowledging that the ongoing 

effects must be remedied,

racial discrimination and racial segregation and to engender the full enjoyment of 

economic, social and cultural rights, as well as civil and political rights,

continue to be victims of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 

intolerance, including their contemporary forms and manifestations, some of which 

manifest in violent forms, 

 Welcoming the efforts made by civil society in support of the follow-up 

mechanisms in the implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of 

Action, 

 Recalling the appointment of the five independent eminent experts by the

56/266 of 27 March 2002, with the mandate to follow up on the implementation of 

the provisions of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and to make 

appropriate recommendations thereon, and in this regard taking note with 

appreciation of the role played, and noting the role still to be played, by those 

independent eminent experts in mobilizing global political will for concrete action 

for the total elimination of all the scourges of racism, racial discrimination, 

xenophobia and related intolerance,  

 Underlining the primacy of the political will, international cooperation and 

adequate funding at the national, regional and international levels needed to address 

all forms and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 

related intolerance for the successful implementation of the Durban Declaration and 

Programme of Action, 

 Recalling its resolution 2142 (XXI) of 26 October 1966, in which it 

proclaimed 21 March as the International Day for the Elimination of Racial 

Discrimination,

designated 25 March as the annual International Day of Remembrance of t he 

Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade,  

 Welcoming, in the above context, the unveiling of the permanent memorial for 

the victims of slavery and the slave trade, including the transatlantic slave trade,

 Welcoming also the call upon all the former colonial Powers for reparations, 

consistent with paragraphs 157 and 158 of the Durban Programme of Action, to 

redress the historical injustices of slavery and the slave trade, including the 

transatlantic slave trade,  

 Recalling the suffering of the victims of racism, racial discrimination, 

xenophobia and related intolerance, and the need to honour their memory,  

 Recognizing and affirming that the global fight against racism, racial 

discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and all their abhorrent and 

contemporary forms and manifestations is a matter of priority for the international 

community, 

 

I 

International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 

Racial Discrimination 

 1. Reaffirms the paramount importance of universal adherence to and the 

full and effective implementation of the International Convention on the 

Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,

Assembly in its resolution 2106 A (XX) of 21 December 1965, in addressing the 

scourges of racism and racial discrimination;  

 2. Calls upon States that have not done so to consider acceding to and/or 

ratifying the Convention, and States parties to consider making the declaration 

under article 14 of the Convention, as well as to consider withdrawing reservations 

to article 4 of the Convention, as a matter of urgency, in view of the fact that the 

continued maintenance of reservations negates the essence of the instrument and 

defeats its objects and purposes; 

 3. Underlines, in the above context, that the provisions of the Convention 

do not respond effectively to contemporary manifestations of racial discrimination, 

in particular in relation to xenophobia and related intolerance, which is recognized 

as the rationale behind the convening of the World Conference against Racism, 

Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in 2001;  

 4. Takes note of the acknowledgement by the Human Rights Council and its 

subsidiary structures of the existence of both procedural and substantive gaps in the 

Convention, which must be filled as a matter of urgency, necessity and priority;  

 5. Expresses its concern at the lack of progress in the elaboration of 

complementary standards to the Convention to fill existing gaps through the 

development of new normative standards aimed at combating all forms of 

contemporary and resurgent scourges of racism, and in this regard calls upon the
