 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its resolutions 1267 (1999) of 15 October 1999, 1333 (2000) of  
19 December 2000, 1363 (2001) of 30 July 2001, 1373 (2001) of 28 September 
2001, 1390 (2002) of 16 January 2002, 1452 (2002) of 20 December 2002, 1455 
(2003) of 17 January 2003, 1526 (2004) of 30 January 2004, 1566 (2004) of  
8 October 2004, 1617 (2005) of 29 July 2005, 1624 (2005) of 14 September 2005, 
and 1699 (2006) of 8 August 2006, and the relevant statements of its President,  

 Reaffirming that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of 
the most serious threats to peace and security and that any acts of terrorism are 
criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivations, whenever and by 
whomsoever committed; and reiterating its unequivocal condemnation of Al-Qaida, 
Usama bin Laden, the Taliban, and other individuals, groups, undertakings, and 
entities associated with them, for ongoing and multiple criminal terrorist acts aimed 
at causing the death of innocent civilians and other victims, destruction of property 
and greatly undermining stability,  

 Expressing its deep concern about the increased violent and terrorist activities 
in Afghanistan of the Taliban and Al-Qaida, and other individuals, groups, 
undertakings, and entities associated with them, 

 Reaffirming the need to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter 
of the United Nations and international law, threats to international peace and 
security caused by terrorist acts, stressing in this regard the important role the 
United Nations plays in leading and coordinating this effort,  

 Stressing that terrorism can only be defeated by a sustained and comprehensive 
approach involving the active participation and collaboration of all States, and 
international and regional organizations to impede, impair, isolate, and incapacitate 
the terrorist threat, 

 Emphasizing that dialogue between the Committee established pursuant to 
resolution 1267 (1999) (“the Committee”) and Member States is vital to the full 
implementation of the measures,  



S/2006/1013  
 

06-68008 2 
 

 Recognizing that one of the most effective means of dialogue between the 
Committee and Member States is through direct contact, including country visits, 

 Welcoming the expanded cooperation with Interpol, including the 
establishment of “Interpol — UN Security Council Special Notices” and the passage 
of resolution 1699 (2006), and encouraging Member States to work in the 
framework of Interpol and other international and regional organizations in order to 
reinforce the implementation of the measures against Al-Qaida, Usama bin Laden, 
and the Taliban, and other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated 
with them, 

 Noting the need for robust implementation of the measures in paragraph 1 of 
this resolution as a significant tool in combating terrorist activity,  

 Reiterating that the measures referred to in paragraph 1 below, are 
preventative in nature and are not reliant upon criminal standards set out under 
national law, 

 Underscoring that, in giving effect to the measures in paragraph 1 of 
resolution 1617 (2005) and other relevant resolutions, full account is to be taken of 
the provisions regarding exemptions in paragraphs 1 and 2 of resolution 1452 
(2002), 

 Taking note of the Committee’s document on the arms embargo 
(SCA/2/06(20)), which is intended to be a useful tool to assist States in the 
implementation of the measures in paragraph 1 (c) of this resolution, 

 Expressing its deep concern about criminal misuse of the internet by Al-Qaida, 
Usama bin Laden, and the Taliban, and other individuals, groups, undertakings, and 
entities associated with them, in furtherance of terrorist acts, 

 Noting with concern the changing nature of the threat presented by Al-Qaida, 
Usama bin Laden and the Taliban, and other individuals, groups, undertakings and 
entities associated with them, in particular the ways in which terrorist ideologies are 
promoted, 

 Stressing the importance of meeting all aspects of the threat that Al-Qaida, 
Usama bin Laden and the Taliban, and other individuals, groups, undertakings and 
entities associated with them represent to international peace and security,  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,
