Equitable geographical distribution of the membership of the

The General Assembly,

Taking note of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2001/76 of 25 April
20011 and Economic and Social Council decision 2001/275 of 24 July 2001,

Reaffirming the importance of the goal of universal ratification of the United
Nations human rights instruments,

Welcoming the significant increase in the number of ratifications of United
Nations human rights instruments, which has especially contributed to their
universality,

Reiterating the importance of the effective functioning of treaty bodies
established pursuant to United Nations human rights instruments for the full and
effective implementation of such instruments,

Recalling that, with regard to the election of the members of the human rights
treaty bodies, the Commission on Human Rights has already recognized the
importance of giving consideration to equitable geographical distribution and gender
balance of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems, and
of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal

capacity and shall be of high moral character, acknowledged impartiality and
recognized competence in the field of human rights,

Recalling also that the Commission on Human Rights has already encouraged
States parties to United Nations human rights treaties, individually and through
meetings of States parties, to consider how to give better effect, inter alia, to the
principle of equitable geographical distribution of the membership of treaty bodies,

Expressing concern at the clear regional imbalance in the current composition
of the membership of the human rights treaty bodies, with the exception of the
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which is already applying a
quota system in the distribution of its seats by regional groups,

Noting in particular that the current status quo tends to be particularly
detrimental for the election of experts from some regional groups,

Convinced that the goal of equitable geographical distribution of the
membership of human rights treaty bodies is perfectly compatible and can be fully
realized and achieved in harmony with the need to ensure gender balance and the
representation of the principal legal systems in those bodies and the high moral
character, acknowledged impartiality and recognized competence in the field of
human rights of their members,

1. Decides to encourage States parties to the United Nations human rights
instruments to establish quota distribution systems by geographical region for the
election of the members of the treaty bodies;

2. Calls upon the States parties to the United Nations human rights
instruments to include, as an agenda item in their forthcoming meetings, the issue of
the establishment of an equitable geographical distribution of the membership of the
respective human rights treaty bodies, based on the recommendations of the
Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and Social Council and on the
present resolution;

3. Recommends the introduction of flexible procedures when establishing
the quotas for each geographical region in each treaty body, encompassing the
following criteria:

(a) Each of the five regional groups established by the General Assembly
must be assigned a quota of the membership of each treaty body equivalent to the
proportion of the total number of States parties to the instrument that it represents;

(b) There must be provision for periodic revisions that reflect the relative
changes in the geographical distribution of States parties;

(c) Automatic periodic revisions should be envisaged in order to avoid
amending the text of the instrument when the quotas are revised;

4. Stresses that the process needed to achieve the goal of equitable
geographical distribution of the membership of human rights treaty bodies can
contribute to raising awareness of the importance of gender balance, to the
representation of the principal legal systems, and to the principle that the members
of the treaty bodies shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be
of high moral character, acknowledged impartiality and recognized competence in
the field of human rights.
