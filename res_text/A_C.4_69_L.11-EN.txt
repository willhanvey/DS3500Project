 Aware of the continuing needs of the Palestine refugees in all fields of

Palestinian Territory, 

 Gravely concerned about the extremely difficult socioeconomic conditions being 

faced by the Palestine refugees in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 

Jerusalem, particularly in the refugee camps in the Gaza Strip, as a result of the 

recurrent military operations, continuing prolonged Israeli closures, the construction 

of settlements and the wall, and the severe economic and movement restrictions that 

in effect amount to a blockade, which have deepened unemployment and poverty rates 

among the refugees, with potentially lasting, long-term negative effects, while taking 

note of developments with regard to the situation of access there, particularly the 

recent tripartite agreement facilitated by the United Nations,  

 Deploring the conflict in and around the Gaza Strip in July and August 2014, 

and the civilian casualties caused, including the killing and injury of thousands of 

Palestinian civilians, including children, women and the elderly, as well as the 

widespread destruction of or damage to thousands of homes and civilian 

infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, water, sanitation and electricity networks,

Agency schools sheltering displaced civilians, and all other breaches of the 

inviolability of United Nations premises during the conflict in the Gaza Strip in July 

and August 2014, 

 Gravely concerned about the lasting negative repercussions of the military 

operations in the Gaza Strip between December 2008 and January 2009, as well as 

in November 2012, on the humanitarian and socioeconomic situation of the 

Palestine refugees in the Gaza Strip,  

 Commending the extraordinary efforts by the Agency to provide shelter  to more 

than 290,000 Palestinian civilians, the majority of them Palestine refugees, as well as

of access there, including the recent tripartite agreement facilitated by the United 

Nations in this regard, 

 Expressing concern about the severe classroom shortage in the Gaza Strip, 

which has been compounded by the destruction caused to schools in the Israeli 

military operations of July and August 2014, as well as the continuing use of 

Agency schools to shelter displaced persons, and the consequent negative impact on 

the right to education of refugee children, 

 Stressing the urgent need for the advancement of reconstruction in the Gaza 

Strip, including by ensuring the timely facilitation of construction projects and by 

sustaining the swift entry of construction materials needed for projects managed by

on both sides,

deliver its services, and regretting profoundly the loss of life among refugees and 

the killing of 14 staff members of the Agency during the crisis since 2012,

need to maintain the neutrality of and safeguard the inviolability of United Nations 

premises, installations and equipment at all times,

the failure to accord the property and assets of the Organization immunity from any 

form of interference and the failure to protect United Nations personnel, premises 

and property,

operations of July and August 2014, 

 Deeply concerned about the continuing imposition of restrictions on the 

freedom of movement and access of the Agency’s staff, vehicles and goods, and the 

injury, harassment and intimidation of the Agency’s staff, which undermine and 

obstruct the work of the Agency, including its ability to provide essential basic and 

emergency services, 

 Aware of the agreement between the Agency and the Government of Israel,  

 Taking note of the agreement reached on 24 June 1994, embodied in an
