implementing sustainable development and that those Territories will be constrained 

in meeting those challenges without the continuing cooperation and assis tance of the 

specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system,

of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations syst em in 

the implementation of the various resolutions and decisions of the United Nations 

relating to decolonization, 

 Bearing in mind the extremely fragile economies of the small island Non-Self-

Governing Territories and their vulnerability to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, 

cyclones and sea level rise, and recalling the relevant resolutions of the General 

Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 71/104 of 6 December 2016 on the implementation of

 4. Also reaffirms that the recognition by the General Assembly, the Security
