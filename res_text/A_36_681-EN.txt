pre-inplemenLation talks, held at Geneva from 7 to 14 January 198I, it has sharply
intensified as a conseguence of the defiant attitude and stepped-up aggression of
the illegal coloniatist 169ine of Pretoria against the Namibian people and the
increased all-round support rendered to that r6gime by the United states of America
and other western States, and that it is therefore incumbent, upon the entire
international community decisivety to intensify concerted action in support of thepeople of Namibia an<i their sole and authentic representative, the South West
Africa Peoplers Organization, for the attainment of their goal,
