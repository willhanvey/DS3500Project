the agreement on the peace process in Côte d’Ivoire (the Pretoria Agreement), under
the auspices of President Thabo Mbeki, and expressing its satisfaction with the first

Reaffirming its resolutions 1325 (2000) of 31 October 2000 on women, peace

continue to collaborate closely in the implementation of the Pretoria Agreement;
