A/C.3/57/L.44

Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration4 and the outcome
documents of the twenty-third5 and twenty-fourth6 special sessions of the General
Assembly, held, respectively, in New York from 5 to 10 June 2000 and Geneva from
26 June to 1 July 2000,

Recalling also its resolutions 56/165 and 56/156 of 19 December 2001,

Recalling further the Commission on Human Rights resolution 2002/28 of 22
April 2002 on globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of human rights,7

Recognizing that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and
interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in
a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis,

Realizing that globalization affects all countries differently and makes them
more exposed to external developments, positive as well as negative, including in
the field of human rights,

Realizing also that globalization is not merely an economic process but that it
also has social, political, environmental, cultural and legal dimensions which have
an impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights,

Realizing the need for undertaking a thorough, independent and comprehensive
assessment of the social, environmental and cultural impact of globalization on
societies,

Recognizing in each culture a dignity and value that deserve recognition,
respect and preservation, and convinced that, in their rich variety and diversity, and
in the reciprocal influences that they exert on one another, all cultures form part of
the common heritage belonging to all humankind, and aware that the risk of a global
monoculture poses more of a threat if the developing world remains poor and
marginalized,

Recognizing that multilateral mechanisms have a unique role to play in
meeting the challenges and opportunities presented by globalization,

Expressing concern at the negative impact of international financial turbulence
on social and economic development and on the full enjoyment of all human rights,

Deeply concerned that the widening gap between the developed and the
developing countries, and within countries, has contributed, inter alia, to deepening
poverty and has adversely affected the full enjoyment of all human rights, in
particular in developing countries,

Noting that human beings strive for a world that is respectful of human rights
and cultural diversity and that, in this regard, they work to ensure that all activities,
including those affected by globalization, are consistent with those aims,

1. Recognizes that, while globalization, by its impact on, inter alia, the role
of the State, may affect human rights, the promotion and protection of all human
rights is first and foremost the responsibility of the State;

2. Reaffirms that narrowing the gap between rich and poor, both within and
between countries, is an explicit goal at the national and international levels, as part
of the effort to create an enabling environment for the full enjoyment of all human
rights;

3. Reaffirms also the commitment to creating an environment at both the
national and the global level that is conducive to development and to the elimination
of poverty through, inter alia, good governance within each country and at the
international level, transparency in the financial, monetary and trading systems and
commitment to an open, equitable, rule-based, predictable and non-discriminatory
multilateral trading and financial system;

4. Recognizes that, while globalization offers great opportunities, its
benefits are very unevenly shared and its costs are unevenly distributed, an aspect of
the process that affects the full enjoyment of all human rights, in particular in
developing countries;

5. Welcomes the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights on globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of human
rights,8 which focuses on the liberalization of agricultural trade and its impact on the
realization of the right to development, including the right to food, and  takes note
of the conclusions and recommendations contained therein;

6. Calls upon Member States, relevant United Nations agencies,
intergovernmental organizations and civil society to promote equitable and
environmentally sustainable economic growth for managing globalization so that
poverty is systematically reduced and the international development targets
achieved;

7. Recognizes that only through broad and sustained efforts, including
policies and measures at the global level to create a shared future based upon our
common humanity in all its diversity, can globalization be made fully inclusive and
equitable and have a human face, thus contributing to the full enjoyment of all
human rights;

8. Underlines the urgent need to establish an equitable, transparent and
democratic international system in which poor people and countries have a more
effective voice;

9. Affirms that globalization is a complex process of structural
transformation, with numerous interdisciplinary aspects, which has an impact on the
enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right
to development;

10. Affirms also that the international community should strive to respond to
the challenges and opportunities posed by globalization in a manner that ensures
respect for the cultural diversity of all;

11. Underlines, therefore, the need to continue to analyse the consequences
of globalization for the full enjoyment of all human rights;

12. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General,9 and requests the

Nations agencies and to submit a substantive report on this subject to the General
Assembly at its fifty-eighth session.
