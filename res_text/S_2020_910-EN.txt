  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 

draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council,  

 Reaffirming its resolutions 1265 (1999), 1325 (2000), 1368 (2001), 1373 (2001), 

1624 (2005), 1894 (2009), 2106 (2013), 2150 (2014), 2170 (2014), 2178 (2014), 2199 

(2015), 2242 (2015), 2249 (2015), 2253 (2015), 2322 (2016), 2331 (2016), 2341 

(2017), 2347 (2017), 2354 (2017), 2367 (2017), 2368 (2017), 2370 (2017), 2490 

(2019) and its relevant presidential statements,  

 Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence 

and unity of Iraq, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the 

United Nations,  

 Recalling that the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as 

Da’esh) constitutes a global threat to international peace and security through its 

terrorist acts, its violent extremist ideology, its continued gross, systematic and 

widespread attacks directed against civilians, its violations of international 

humanitarian law and abuses of human rights, particularly those committed against 

women and children, and including those motivated by religious or ethnic grounds, 

and its recruitment and training of foreign terrorist fighters whose threat affects all 

regions and Member States,  

 Condemning the commission of acts by ISIL (Da’esh) involving murder, 

kidnapping, hostage-taking, suicide bombings, enslavement, sale into or otherwise 

forced marriage, trafficking in persons, rape, sexual slavery and other forms of sexual 

violence, recruitment and use of children, attacks on critical infrastructure, as well as 

its destruction of cultural heritage, including archaeological sites, and trafficking of 

cultural property,  

 Recognizing that the commission of such acts which may amount to war crimes, 

crimes against humanity or genocide, is part of the ideology and strategic objectives 

of ISIL (Da’esh), and used by ISIL (Da’esh) as a tactic of terrorism, and that holding 

ISIL (Da’esh) members accountable, particularly those who bear the greatest 

responsibility, including in terms of leadership, which can include regional or 

mid-level commanders, and the ordering and commission of crimes, will further 

expose this, and could assist in countering terrorism and violent extremism which can 

be conducive to terrorism, including by stemming financing and the continued flow 

of international recruits to the terrorist group ISIL (Da’esh),  

 Welcoming the considerable efforts of the Government of Iraq to defeat ISIL 

(Da’esh), and recalling its letter to the Secretary-General and Security Council dated
