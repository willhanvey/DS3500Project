Believing that the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South
Asia, as in other regions, will assist in the strengthening of the security of
the States of the region against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons,

Taking note with appreciation of the declarations issued at the highest
level by the Governments of South Asian States that are developing their
peaceful nuclear programmes, reaffirming their undertaking not to acquire or
manufacture nuclear weapons and to devote their nuclear programmes exclusively
to the economic and social advancement of their peoples,

Welcoming the proposal for the conclusion of a bilateral or regional
nuclear-test-ban agreement in South Asia,

Noting the proposal to convene, under the auspices of the United Nations, a
conference on nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia as soon as possible, with
the participation of the regional and other concerned States,

Noting the proposal to hold consultations among five nations with a view to
ensuring nuclear non-proliferation in the region,

Considering that the eventual participation of other States, as
appropriate, in this process could be useful,

Bearing in mind the provisions of paragraphs 60 to 63 of the Final Document
of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly1 regarding the
establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, including in the region of South
Asia,

Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General,2

1. Reaffirms its endorsement, in principle, of the concept of a nuclear-
weapon-free zone in South Asia;

2. Urges once again the States of South Asia to continue to make all
possible efforts to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia and to
refrain, in the meantime, from any action contrary to that objective;

3. Welcomes the support of all the five nuclear-weapon States for this
proposal, and calls upon them to extend the necessary cooperation in the efforts
to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia;

4. Requests the Secretary-General to communicate with the States of the
region and other concerned States in order to ascertain their views on the issue
and to promote consultations among them with a view to exploring the best
possibilities of furthering the efforts for the establishment of a nuclear-
weapon-free zone in South Asia;
