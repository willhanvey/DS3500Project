accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, and reaffirming the principles 

contained therein, 

 Recalling its resolution 3314 (XXIX) of 14 December 1974, entitled “Definition 

of aggression”, 

 Recalling also its resolution 68/262 of 27 March 2014 on the territorial integrity

Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol and to refrain from any action or 

dealing that might be interpreted as recognizing any such altered status,

Human Rights of the Council of Europe and of the human rights assessment mission 

of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights and the High

Monitoring Mission to Ukraine have continuously been denied access by the 

occupying Power to Crimea, despite their existing mandates, which cover the entire 

territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, and emphasizing

provide in monitoring the human rights situation in Crimea as a priority activity 

according to its mandate, 

 Concerned about additional challenges for the enjoyment of human rights and 

fundamental freedoms by residents of Crimea resulting from unnecessary and 

disproportionate restrictive measures taken by the occupying Power under the pretext 

of combating the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as about the 

lack of ensuring and maintaining public health and hygiene, including measures on 

preventing the spread of COVID-19, in Crimea by the occupying Power in accordance 

with the international humanitarian law,

which exposes the detainees to the risk of the spread of diseases, including COVID-19, 

 Recalling the prohibition under international humanitarian law for the 

occupying Power to compel the inhabitants of an occupied territory to swear 

allegiance to the occupying Power,  

 Condemning the imposition and retroactive application of the legal system of 

the Russian Federation, and its negative impact on the human rights situation in 

Crimea, the imposition of automatic Russian citizenship on protected persons in 

Crimea, which is contrary to international humanitarian law, including the Geneva 

Conventions and customary international law, and the deportation, regressive effects 

on the enjoyment of human rights and effective restriction of land ownership of those 

who have rejected that citizenship,  

 Gravely concerned by consistent reports that the Russian law enforcement 

system uses involuntary placement in a psychiatric institution as a form of harassment 

against and punishment of political opponents and activists,

 Deeply concerned about continued reports that the law enforcement system of 

the Russian Federation conducts searches and raids of private homes, businesses and

recalling that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibits 

arbitrary or unlawful interference with a person’s privacy, family, home or 

correspondence, 

 Gravely concerned that, since 2014, torture has reportedly been used by the

and expressing deep concern about the ongoing arbitrary detentions and arrests by the 

Russian Federation of Ukrainian citizens, including Emir-Usein Kuku, Server 

Mustafayev and many others,

torture and ill-treatment, in particular to extract confessions, and psychiatric

work, as well as the ability to maintain their identity and culture and to education in 

the Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar languages, 

 Expressing concern about the militarization and assimilation of young people in 

Crimea by the Russian Federation and its blocking of the access of Crimeans to 

Ukrainian education, 

 Gravely concerned by the above-mentioned policies and practices of the 

Russian Federation, which cause a continuing threat and have caused a large number 

of Crimean residents to flee from Crimea,  

 Recalling that individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of 

protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying Power, or to 

that of any other country, occupied or not, and the deportation or transfer by an 

occupying Power of parts of its own civilian population into the territory that it occupies, 

are prohibited under international humanitarian law, regardless of their motive,

policies and conducts practices aimed at changing the demographic structure in 

Crimea, and recalling in this respect that the occupying Power shall not deport or 

transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory that it occupies,  

 Reaffirming the right of return of all internally displaced persons and refugees

5/10 20-14430 

 

expropriation of land, demolition of houses and depletion of natural and agricultural 

resources, which have a negative impact on the physical character of Crimea and thus 

contribute to changing the economic and demographic structure of Crimea,  

 Reaffirming its serious concern that, according to the decision of the so-called 

“Supreme Court of Crimea” of 26 April 2016 and the decision of the Supreme Court 

of the Russian Federation of 29 September 2016, the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar 

People, the self-governing body of the Crimean Tatars, continues to be declared an 

extremist organization and the ban on its activities has still not been repealed,

communities, including through frequent police raids, demolition of and eviction 

from buildings dedicated to religion, undue registration requirements that have 

affected legal status and property rights and threats against and persecution of those

Muslim religious schools, Greek Catholics, Roman Catholics and Jehovah’s 

Witnesses, and condemning also the baseless prosecution of dozens of peaceful 

Muslims for allegedly belonging to Islamic organizations,

of Crimea and the failure of the occupying Power to respect fair trial standards,  

 Condemning the continuous widespread misuse of counter-terrorism and 

anti-extremism laws to suppress dissent,  

 Strongly condemning in this regard the ongoing pressure and mass detentions on 

terrorism, extremism and espionage grounds and other forms of repression against 

human rights defenders, civil rights activists, including against activists of the Crimean 

Solidarity civic initiative, which documents abuses on the peninsula and provides 

humanitarian assistance to the families of victims of politically motivated prosecutions,

Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Ukraine 

v. Russian Federation),10 

 Recalling also the prohibition under the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 

for the occupying Power to compel protected persons to serve in its armed or auxiliary 

forces, including through pressure or propaganda that is aimed at securing voluntary 

enlistment, and condemning the ongoing recruitment campaign in Crimea and 

criminal prosecutions of Crimean men for draft evasion,  

 Recalling further that a free press, or other media, is essential to promote the 

right to hold opinions and to freedom of expression and the enjoyment of other human 

rights and fundamental freedoms, concerned about reports that journalists, media 

workers and citizen journalists continue to face unjustified interference with their 

reporting activities in Crimea, and expressing deep concern that journalists, media 

workers and citizen journalists have been arbitrarily arrested, detained, prosecuted, 

harassed and intimidated in Crimea as a direct result for their reporting activities,  

 Underlining the importance of the measures to develop transparent, accessible, 

non-discriminatory and expeditious procedures and regulations governing access to 

Crimea for human rights defenders, journalists, media workers and lawyers, as well 

as the possibility to appeal, in accordance with national legislation and in conformity 

with all applicable international law,
