Assistance to Palestine refugees 

The General Assembly,

resolutions referred to therein, including resolution 194 (III) of 
11 December 1948,

Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, 
covering the period from 1 July 1974 to 30 June 1975, l/ 

1. Notes with deep regret that repatriation or compensation of the 
refugees as provided for in paragraph 11 of General Assembly 
resolution 194 (III) has not been effected, that no substantial progress has 
been made in the programme endorsed by the Assembly in paragraph 2 of 
resolution 513 (VI) of 26 January 1952 for the reintegration of refugees 
either by repatriation or resettlement and that, therefore, the situation of 
the refugees continues to be a matter of serious concern; 

2. Expresses its thanks to the Commissioner-General and to the staff of 
the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near 
East for their continued dedicated and effective efforts under difficult 
circumstances to provide essential services for the Palestine refugees, and to 
the specialized agencies and private organizations for their valuable work in 
assisting the refugees;

3. Notes with regret that the United Nations Conciliation Ccmmission for 
Palestine has been unable to find a means of achieving progress in the 
implementation of paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III) and 
reQuests the Commission to exert continued efforts towards the implementation 
of that paragraph and to report as appropriate, but no later than 
1 October 1976; 

4. Directs attention to the continuing seriousness of the financial 
position of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees 
in the Near East, as outlined in the Commissioner-General's report; 

5. Notes with profound concern that, despite the commendable and 
successful efforts of the Commissioner-General to collect additional 
contributions, this increased level of income to the United Nations Relief and 
Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East is still insufficient 
to cover essential budget reQuirements in the present year, and that, at 
presently foreseen levels of giving, deficits will recur each year; 

6. Calls upon all Governments as a matter of urgency to make the most 
generous efforts possible to meet the anticipated needs of the United Nations 
Relief and \forks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, particularly 
in the lieht of the budgetary deficits projected in the Commissioner-General's 
report, and therefore urges non-contributing Governments to contribute 
regularly and contributing Governments to consider increasing their regular 
contributions.
