Welcoming also the acceptance by the Government of Morocco and the
POLISARIO Front of the detailed modalities for the implementation of the
Secretary-General’s package of measures relating to the identification of

not be turned into a second round of identification;

Commission from 25 to 30 members, and the proposed increase also in the

expeditiously;

3. Requests the Secretary-General to report every 45 days on significant
developments in the implementation of the Settlement Plan, in particular on the

of the parties during the resumption of voter identification and during the
start of the appeals process; agreement by the Government of Morocco on the
modalities of implementing paragraph 42 of the Status of Forces Agreement;
