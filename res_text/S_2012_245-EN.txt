 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its Resolution 2042 (2012), as well as its Presidential Statements of 
3 August 2011, 21 March 2012 and 5 April 2012, and also recalling all relevant 
resolutions of the General Assembly,  

 Reaffirming its support to the Joint Special Envoy for the United Nations and 
the League of Arab States, Kofi Annan, and his work, following General Assembly 
resolution A/RES/66/253 of 16 February 2012 and relevant resolutions of the 
League of Arab States, 

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 
territorial integrity of Syria, and to the purposes and principles of the Charter, 

 Condemning the widespread violations of human rights by the Syrian 
authorities, as well as any human rights abuses by armed groups, recalling that those 
responsible shall be held accountable, and expressing its profound regret at the 
death of many thousands of people in Syria, 

 Expressing its appreciation of the significant efforts that have been made by 
the States bordering Syria to assist Syrians who have fled across Syria’s borders as a 
consequence of the violence, and requesting UNHCR to provide assistance as 
requested by member states receiving these displaced persons, 

 Expressing also its appreciation of the humanitarian assistance that has been 
provided to Syria by other States, 

 Noting the Syrian government’s commitment on 25 March 2012 to implement 
the six-point proposal of the Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and the 
League of Arab States, and to implement urgently and visibly its commitments, as it 
agreed to do in its communication to the Envoy of 1 April 2012, to (a) cease troop 
movements towards population centres, (b) cease all use of heavy weapons in such 
centres, and (c) begin pullback of military concentrations in and around population 
centres, and to implement these in their entirety by no later than 10 April 2012, and 
noting also the Syrian opposition’s expressed commitment to respect the cessation 
of violence, provided the government does so, 

 Expressing concern over ongoing violence and reports of casualties which 
have escalated again in recent days, following the Envoy’s assessment of 12 April 
2012 that the parties appeared to be observing a cessation of fire and that the Syrian 



S/2012/245  
 

12-30608 2 
 

government had started to implement its commitments, and noting that the cessation 
of armed violence in all its forms is therefore clearly incomplete, 

 Supporting the Envoy’s call for an immediate and visible implementation by 
the Syrian government of all elements of the Envoy’s six-point proposal in their 
entirety to achieve a sustained cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all 
parties,  

 Taking note of the assessment by the Secretary-General that a United Nations 
monitoring mission deployed quickly when the conditions are conducive with a 
clear mandate, the requisite capacities, and the appropriate conditions of operation 
would greatly contribute to observing and upholding the commitment of the parties 
to a cessation of armed violence in all its forms and to supporting the 
implementation of the six-point plan,  

 Noting the 19 April 2012 Preliminary Understanding (S/2012/250) agreed 
between the Syrian Arab Republic and the United Nations which provides a basis 
for a protocol governing the Advance Team and, upon its deployment, the 
UN supervision mechanism, 

 Having considered the Secretary-General’s letter addressed to the President of 
Security Council(S/2012/238), 

 1. Reaffirms its full support for and calls for the urgent, comprehensive, and 
immediate implementation of all elements of the Envoy’s six-point proposal as 
annexed to resolution 2042 (2012) aimed at bringing an immediate end to all 
violence and human rights violations, securing humanitarian access and facilitating 
a Syrian-led political transition leading to a democratic, plural political system, in 
which citizens are equal regardless of their affiliations, ethnicities or beliefs, 
including through commencing a comprehensive political dialogue between the 
Syrian government and the whole spectrum of the Syrian opposition; 

 2. Calls upon the Syrian government to implement visibly its commitments 
in their entirety, as it agreed to do in the Preliminary Understanding and as 
stipulated in resolution 2042 (2012), to (a) cease troop movements towards 
population centres, (b) cease all use of heavy weapons in such centres, (c) complete 
pullback of military concentrations in and around population centres, as well as to 
withdraw its troops and heavy weapons from population centres to their barracks or 
temporary deployment places to facilitate a sustained cessation of violence; 

 3. Calls upon all parties in Syria, including the opposition, immediately to 
cease all armed violence in all its forms;  

 4. Calls upon the Syrian armed opposition groups and relevant elements to 
respect relevant provisions of the Preliminary Understanding; 

 5. Decides to establish for an initial period of 90 days a United Nations 
Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS) under the command of a Chief Military 
Observer, comprising an initial deployment of up to 300 unarmed military observers 
as well as an appropriate civilian component as required by the Mission to fulfil its 
mandate, and decides further that the Mission shall be deployed expeditiously 
subject to assessment by the Secretary-General of relevant developments on the 
ground, including the consolidation of the cessation of violence; 



 S/2012/245
 

3 12-30608 
 

 6. Decides also that the mandate of the Mission shall be to monitor a 
cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties and to monitor and support 
the full implementation of the Envoy’s six-point proposal; 

 7. Requests that the Secretary-General and the Syrian government without 
delay conclude a Status of Mission Agreement (SOMA), taking into consideration 
General Assembly resolution 58/82 on the scope of legal protection under the 
Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, and notes the 
agreement between the Syrian government and the United Nations that, pending the 
conclusion of such an agreement, the model SOFA agreement of 9 October 1990 
(A/45/594) shall apply provisionally; 

 8. Calls upon the Syrian government to ensure the effective operation of 
UNSMIS by: facilitating the expeditious and unhindered deployment of its 
personnel and capabilities as required to fulfil its mandate; ensuring its full, 
unimpeded, and immediate freedom of movement and access as necessary to fulfil 
its mandate, underlining in this regard the need for the Syrian government and the 
United Nations to agree rapidly on appropriate air transportation assets for 
UNSMIS; allowing its unobstructed communications; and allowing it to freely and 
privately communicate with individuals throughout Syria without retaliation against 
any person as a result of interaction with UNSMIS; 

 9. Calls upon the parties to guarantee the safety of UNSMIS personnel 
without prejudice to its freedom of movement and access, and stresses that the 
primary responsibility in this regard lies with the Syrian authorities; 

 10. Requests the Secretary-General to report immediately to the Security 
Council any obstructions to the effective operation of UNSMIS by any party;  

 11. Reiterates its call for the Syrian authorities to allow immediate, full and 
unimpeded access of humanitarian personnel to all populations in need of 
assistance, in accordance with international law and guiding principles of 
humanitarian assistance and calls upon all parties in Syria, in particular the Syrian 
authorities, to cooperate fully with the United Nations and relevant humanitarian 
organizations to facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance; 

 12. Invites all Member States to consider making appropriate contributions to 
UNSMIS as requested by the Secretary-General; 

 13. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Council on the 
implementation of this resolution within 15 days of its adoption and every 15 days 
thereafter, and also to submit, as necessary, to the Council proposals for possible 
adjustments to the UNSMIS mandate; 

 14. Expresses its intention to assess the implementation of this resolution and 
to consider further steps as appropriate; 

 15. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
