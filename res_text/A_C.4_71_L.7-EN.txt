resolution 302 (IV),
2
 which was conveyed by the Secretary-General on

concern regarding the severe financial crisis of the Agency and the negative 

implications for the continued delivery of core programmes to the Palestine refugees 

in all fields of operation, 

 Aware of the growing needs of the Palestine refugees throughout all the fields 

of operation, namely, Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic and the Occupied 

Palestinian Territory, 

 Expressing grave concern at the especially difficult situation of the Palestine 

refugees under occupation, including with regard to their safety, well-being and 

socioeconomic living conditions,  

 Expressing grave concern in particular at the grave humanitarian situation and 

socioeconomic conditions of the Palestine refugees in the Gaza Strip, and 

underlining the importance of emergency and humanitarian assistance and urgent 

reconstruction efforts, 

 Noting the signing of the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self -

Government Arrangements on 13 September 1993 by the Government of Israel and 

the Palestine Liberation Organization

 and the subsequent implementation 

agreements,  

 1. Notes with regret that repatriation or compensation of the refugees, as 

provided for in paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), has not yet 

been effected, and that, therefore, the situation of the Palestine refugees continues to 

be a matter of grave concern and the Palestine refugees continue to require 

assistance to meet basic health, education and living needs;  

 2. Also notes with regret that the United Nations Conciliation Commission 

for Palestine has been unable to find a means of achieving progress in the 

implementation of paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), and 

reiterates its request to the Conciliation Commission to continue exerting efforts  

towards the implementation of that paragraph and to report to the Assembly on the 

efforts being exerted in this regard as appropriate, but no later than 1 September 

2017; 

 3. Affirms the necessity for the continuation of the work of the United 

Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and the 

importance of its unimpeded operation and its provision of services, including 

emergency assistance, for the well-being, protection and human development of the 

Palestine refugees and for the stability of the region, pending the just resolution of 

the question of the Palestine refugees;
