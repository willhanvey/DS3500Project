Declaration on Sustainable Development4 and the Plan of Implementation of the World 
Summit on Sustainable Development (“Johannesburg Plan of Implementation”),5  

 Recalling further the 2005 World Summit Outcome,6 

 Recalling its resolution 63/235 of 22 December 2008 on agriculture 
development and food security,  

 Recognizing the work done by the Commission on Sustainable Development, 
in particular at its sixteenth and seventeenth sessions, highlighting the thematic 
focus on agriculture-related issues, and applauding its call to increase investment in 
training research and development, in particular on sustainable practices and 
technologies, including agricultural technologies, and to accelerate the transfer and 
diffusion of such technologies, information, methods and practices to reach all 
users, including farmers, women, youth and indigenous people as well as those in 
remote rural areas,  

 Acknowledging the work performed by the High-level Task Force on the 
Global Food Security Crisis, established by the Secretary-General in 2008, and the 
Comprehensive Framework for Action that it produced, specifically its call for 
increased investments in the development of agricultural technology as well as the 
transfer and use of existing technologies, as appropriate, especially for smallholder 
farmers as a means to achieve global food security and poverty reduction,  

 Recalling the World Summit on Food Security convened by the Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Rome from 16 to 18 November 
2009, and stressing the vital role of international cooperation in advancing and 
implementing agricultural technologies,  

 Welcoming the commitment by the Group of Eight and more than twenty-five 
countries and organizations in the Joint Statement on Global Food Security, adopted 
in L’Aquila, Italy, on 10 July 2009, towards the goal of mobilizing 20 billion United 
States dollars over three years focused on sustainable agriculture development,  

 Reaffirming its commitment to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, 
and recognizing the beneficial impact that the adoption of agricultural technologies 
can have in achieving those goals, including in eradicating extreme poverty and 
hunger, empowering women and ensuring environmental sustainability,  

 Concerned by the slow progress so far in achieving the above-mentioned 
goals, in particular by the fact that Africa remains the only continent currently not 
on track to achieve any of the goals of the Millennium Declaration by 2015, and 
recognizing the need to intensify the efforts of the international community in its 
attempt to reach the internationally agreed development goals, including the 
Millennium Development Goals,  

 Acknowledging the importance and the potential of smallholder farmers in 
increasing agricultural production, achieving economic growth and reducing 
poverty,

 Stressing the critical role of women in the agricultural sector and their 
contribution in enhancing agricultural and rural development, improving food 
security and eradicating rural poverty, and underlining further that meaningful 
progress in agricultural development necessitates a focus on supporting and 
empowering women,  

 Acknowledging the role and work of civil society in furthering progress in 
developing countries, in promoting the use of sustainable agricultural technology 
and the training of smallholder farmers, in raising awareness and in the provision 
and dissemination of information,  

 Aware that the world financial and economic crisis, in addition to other global 
challenges, have a negative impact on food security and development, specifically 
in the agricultural sector, thereby negatively impacting the most vulnerable groups 
and potentially setting back progress made in achieving the Millennium 
Development Goals,  

 Considering the increasing need to innovate in agriculture and food production 
in order to respond to the challenges posed by, inter alia, climate change, depletion 
and scarcity of natural resources, urbanization and globalization, and recognizing 
that sustainable agricultural technologies can greatly contribute to the adaptation of 
agriculture to, and help mitigate the negative impact of, climate change, land 
degradation and desertification,  

 Underscoring the importance of collaboration, sharing of information and 
dissemination of agricultural technology research results as well as wide 
consultation when defining the global, regional and national research agendas, and 
in this regard notes the valuable role of, inter alia, the Global Forum on Agricultural 
Research and its affiliated or associated organizations,  

 1. Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on agricultural technology 
for development;7 

 2. Calls upon Member States and relevant United Nations organizations to 
make greater efforts to develop and disseminate appropriate sustainable agricultural 
technologies, particularly in and with developing countries, under fair, transparent 
and mutually agreed terms, and to support national efforts to foster utilization of 
local know-how and agricultural technologies, promote agricultural technology 
research and enable poor rural women, men and youth to increase sustainable 
agricultural productivity and enhance food security;  

 3. Calls attention to the crucial role of women in the agricultural sector, and 
therefore calls upon Member States to promote and support better access of women 
to agricultural technology information and know-how, equipment and decision-
making forums;  

 4. Underlines the importance of supporting and advancing research in 
improving and diversifying crop varieties, as well as supporting the establishment of 
agricultural systems and sustainable management practices, in order to make 
agriculture more resilient and, in particular, to make crops more tolerant to 
environmental stress, including drought and climate change, in a manner consistent 
with national regulations and relevant international agreements;

 5. Also underlines the importance of the sustainable use and management of 
water resources to increase and ensure agricultural productivity, and calls for further 
efforts to strengthen the provision and proper maintenance of irrigation facilities as 
well as to introduce water saving technology, considering the possible impact of 
climate change on water resources;  

 6. Encourages Member States, civil society and public and private 
institutions to develop partnerships to support financial and market services, 
including training, capacity-building, infrastructure and extension services to 
farmers, in particular smallholder farmers, and calls for further efforts by all 
stakeholders to make appropriate sustainable agricultural technologies available and 
affordable to smallholder farmers;  

 7. Calls upon Member States to include sustainable agricultural 
development as an integral part of their national policies and strategies, notes the 
positive impact that North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation can have 
in this regard, and urges the relevant bodies of the United Nations system to include 
elements of agricultural technology, research and development in efforts to achieve 
the Millennium Development Goals;  

 8. Requests relevant United Nations organizations, including the Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the International Fund for 
Agricultural Development, to promote, support and facilitate the exchange of 
experience among Member States on ways to sustainably expand areas for 
agriculture and increase opportunities for agricultural development through 
technologies that allow soil recovery, improve soil fertility and increase agricultural 
production in pressing environmental circumstances;  

 9. Underscores the instrumental role of agricultural technology in 
furthering sustainable development and in achieving the Millennium Development 
Goals, calls therefore upon Member States and encourages relevant international 
bodies to support sustainable agricultural research and development, and in this 
regard calls for the continued support to the international agricultural research 
system, including the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research as 
well as other relevant international organizations;  

 10. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its 
sixty-sixth session a report on the implementation of the present resolution.
