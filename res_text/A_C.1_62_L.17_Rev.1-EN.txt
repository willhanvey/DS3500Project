fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, which 
would offer an opportunity to review, from a perspective more in tune with the 
current international situation, the most critical aspects of the process of 
disarmament and to mobilize the international community and public opinion in 
favour of the elimination of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and of 
the control and reduction of conventional weapons, 

 Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration, adopted by the Heads of 
State and Government during the Millennium Summit of the United Nations, held in 
New York from 6 to 8 September 2000,3 in which the Heads of State and 
Government resolved “to strive for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, 
particularly nuclear weapons, and to keep all options open for achieving this aim, 
including the possibility of convening an international conference to identify ways 
of eliminating nuclear dangers”,

devoted to disarmament can set the future course of action in the fields of 
disarmament, arms control, non-proliferation and related international security 
matters,

arms control, non-proliferation and related international security matters,

special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament,6

committee, for the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to 
disarmament,7
