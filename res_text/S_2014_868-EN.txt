sustain well-functioning and accountable government institutions, particularly of the 

rule of law and security sectors, 

 Stressing the need for continued progress on security sector reform in Liberia 

to ensure that Liberia’s military, police, and border security forces are self -

 Underlining that the transparent and effective management of natural 

resources is critical for Liberia’s sustainable peace and security,  

 Underlining its determination to support the Government of Liberia in its 

efforts to meet the conditions of resolution 1521 (2003), welcoming the engagement
