of States,

of the policy of division of the l"rarId into blocs or by individual states,

and prosperity for all pecples , through the establishment of the ne',T international
economic order,

at the e;lobal, regional or subregioanl levels, pursued in the context of the policy
of division of the vrorld into blocs or by individual States;

2. Decla~es that no State or r;roup of States shall, under any circumst2.Dce
or for any reason whatsoever, pursue hegemony in international relations or seek
a position of dominance~ either globally or in any region of the world;

30 Re,lects all forms of domination, subjugation, interference or intervention
and all forms of pres sure, whether political, ideological ~ economic ~ military or
cultural, in international relations;

force, direct or indirect aggression, occupation and the grmving practice of
