Annex I 
 

  Letter dated 11 November 2006 from the Prime Minister of Iraq 
addressed to the President of the Security Council 
 

[Original: Arabic and English] 

 Iraq has taken in the specified time the steps required for the completion of the 
political process, in particular the drafting of a permanent constitution and the 
laying of foundations for building its political and legal institutions. In May 2006, 
the constitutionally elected Council of Representatives formed a Government of 
national unity. The steps for building a democratic, federal and united Iraq were 
consolidated by the commitment of the Government to adopt a dialogue and national 
reconciliation scheme, secure broad political participation, monitor human rights, 
establish the rule of law and economic development and provide services to citizens. 

 Establishing security and securing permanent stability are among the highest 
priorities of the Iraqi Government’s programme to realize the desired peace and 
prosperity for the Iraqi people. However, terrorists and forces hostile to democracy 
continue to target innocent citizens and the various State institutions. 

 Security and stability in Iraq are the responsibility of the Iraqi Government. 
The Security Council affirmed in its resolution 1546 (2004) that Iraqi security forces 
would play a progressively greater role in enabling the Iraqi Government to assume 
that responsibility, diminishing and thereby ending the role of the multinational 
force, when the responsibility for security of the Iraqi security forces increases and 
expands. From the experience of the past two and a half years, it was established 
that the Iraqi security forces, which operated under the command of the Iraqi 
Government, had acquired new experiences and responsibilities and had grown in 
size, experience and capacity, demonstrated by their increased ability to assume full 
responsibility in the fields of security and defence. 

 We started to reap the fruits of success when our forces assumed responsibility 
for security in the governorates of Al Muthanna and Dhi Qar. In September 2006, 
the Ministry of Defence assumed the operational command and control of the 
ground, naval and air force commands. It also assumed operational command and 
control over two military divisions, indicating an increase in the ability of the Iraqi 
Army to assume the leadership in providing security to the Iraqi people. The Iraqi 
Government is also relentlessly working on building the necessary administrative 
and logistics system to make our Iraqi forces self-sufficient. 

 It is the intention of the Iraqi Government to continue increasing the number 
of governorates that fall fully under the control of the Iraqi authorities during 2006, 
until all 18 are under their control. When the responsibilities for security are 
transferred to the Iraqi authorities in a certain governorate, the multinational force 
will be present in its bases and can provide support to Iraqi security forces at the 
request of the Iraqi authorities, in accordance with an agreement that allocates the 
authorities and responsibilities between the two sides.  

 We have agreed on three common goals: first, assumption by Iraq of 
recruiting, training, equipping and arming of Iraqi security forces; second, 
assumption by Iraq of command and control over Iraqi forces; and third, transferring 
responsibility for security to the Government of Iraq. We have formed a high-level 
working group that will provide recommendations on how best to achieve these 



 S/2006/919

goals. It has also been agreed to work towards the Iraqi authorities’ assuming the 
apprehension, detention and imprisonment tasks on the basis of an agreement to be 
reached between the Government of Iraq and the multinational force. 

 Hence, the Iraqi Government requests the extension of the mandate of the 
multinational force in accordance with Security Council resolutions 1546 (2004) 
and 1637 (2005) and the letters attached thereto for another 12 months starting on 
31 December 2006, provided that the extension is subject to a commitment by the 
Council to end the mandate at an earlier date if the Iraqi Government so requests 
and that the mandate is subject to periodic review before 15 June 2007. The Iraqi 
Government requests the termination of the UNMOVIC mission due to the 
completion of its tasks. The Iraqi Government believes that the time has come to 
terminate the war compensations that were imposed on Iraq. 

 The Iraqi Government realizes that the provisions of resolution 1546 (2004) 
relating to the depositing of revenues in the Development Fund for Iraq and the role 
of the International Advisory and Monitoring Board help to ensure the use of the 
natural resources of Iraq for the benefit of the people of Iraq. We recognize that the 
fund plays an important role in convincing donors and creditors that Iraq is 
managing its resources and debts in a responsible way for the Iraqi people. This role 
is vital, especially since Iraq is seeking to form a new partnership with the 
international community to build a vital network for economic transformation and 
integration in the economies of the region and the world through the International 
Compact with Iraq. We ask the Security Council to extend the mandate of the 
Development Fund for Iraq and the International Advisory and Monitoring Board 
for another 12 months and to review this mandate based on the request of the Iraqi 
Government before 15 June 2007. 

 The people of Iraq are determined to establish a stable and peaceful democracy 
for themselves and a proper basis for building a vital economy. This vision for the 
future of Iraq cannot become a reality without the help of the international 
community.  

 We realize that the Security Council intends to append the present letter to the 
special resolution concerning Iraq that is being prepared. Meanwhile, I ask that the 
present letter be distributed to the members of the Security Council as soon as 
possible.

Annex II 
 

  Letter dated 17 November 2006 from the Secretary of State of the 
United States of America to the President of the Security Council 
 
 

 Having reviewed the request of the Government of Iraq to extend the mandate 
of the Multinational Force (MNF) in Iraq and following consultations with the 
Government of Iraq, I am writing to confirm, consistent with this request, that MNF 
under unified command stands ready to continue to fulfil its mandate as set out in 
Security Council resolution 1546 (2004) and extended by Security Council 
resolution 1637 (2005). 

 The Government of Iraq and MNF in Iraq continue to improve their 
cooperation through a security partnership to combat the challenges that threaten 
Iraq’s security and stability. This partnership has evolved over time to incorporate 
the increasing leadership by Iraqi security forces in fighting and deterring terrorism 
and other violent acts throughout Iraq’s 18 provinces. In the context of this 
partnership, MNF is prepared to continue to undertake a broad range of tasks to 
contribute to the maintenance of security and stability and to ensure force 
protection, acting under the authorities set forth in resolution 1546 (2004), including 
the tasks and arrangements set out in the letters annexed thereto, and in close 
cooperation with the Government of Iraq. The forces that make up MNF will remain 
committed to acting consistently with their obligations and rights under 
international law, including the law of armed conflict. 

 Iraqi security forces have already made substantial progress this year in 
developing their capabilities and, as a result, they are shouldering a greater portion 
of the responsibility for Iraq’s security. This progress is most notable in their 
assumption of security responsibility in Dhi Qar and Muthana and the assumption of 
operational command and control over the Ground, Naval, and Air Force Commands 
and two Iraqi military divisions by the Ministry of Defense. 

 The Government of Iraq and MNF have agreed on three common goals: Iraqi 
assumption of recruiting, training, equipping and arming of the Iraqi security forces; 
Iraqi assumption of command and control over Iraqi forces; and transferring 
responsibility for security to the Government of Iraq. We look forward to 
recommendations from the newly formed high-level working group on how these 
goals can best be achieved. The strong partnership between the Government of Iraq 
and MNF is a vital factor in fulfilling these goals. Together we will build towards 
the day when the Iraqi forces assume full responsibility for the maintenance of 
security and stability in Iraq. 

 The co-sponsors intend to annex this letter to the resolution on Iraq that is 
under consideration. In the meantime, I request that you provide copies of the 
present letter to members of the Council as quickly as possible.
