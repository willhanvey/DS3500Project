 Reaffirming that regional cooperation plays a fundamental role in promoting and 

protecting human rights and should reinforce universal human rights, as contained in 

international human rights instruments, and their protection,  

 Recognizing that the Centre has made noticeable progress in the promotion of 

human rights and advocacy in the region and will continue to strengthen its 

effectiveness and efficiency in responding to ongoing and emerging needs and will 

enhance its capacity-building and technical assistance, in particular in countries in 

conflict and post-conflict countries, 

 Mindful of the vastness and the diversity of the needs in the field of human 

rights within South-West Asia and the Arab region, and taking into account the need 

for appropriate and sustainable funding of the Centre to fully realize its significant 

function and crucial role in the region,

Region has provided through human rights capacity-building activities, technical 

assistance programmes and training programmes on combating trafficking in persons, 

human rights and media, human rights and diplomacy and human rights education, as 

well as support to national human rights institutions and regional consultations on the 

topics of United Nations human rights mechanisms, and notes that the Centre also 

provided capacity-building for civil society and organized various workshops 

focusing on the specific needs of the region;

greater effectiveness and efficiency in the implementation of its mandate;

to meet an increasing number of requests for training and documentation, including in 

the Arabic language; 

 5. Notes that the increasing demand that has been placed on the Centre by 

Member States and other stakeholders reveals a growing recognition of its role and 

impact on strengthening human rights capacities in the region;  

 6. Encourages the continued engagement of the Centre to work with other 

United Nations regional offices to strengthen its work and to avoid duplication;  

 7. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its
