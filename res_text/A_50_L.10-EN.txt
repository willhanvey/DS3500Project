NECESSITY OF ENDING THE ECONOMIC, COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL EMBARGO
IMPOSED BY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AGAINST CUBA

Cuba: draft resolution

The General Assembly,

Determined to encourage strict compliance with the purposes and principles
enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations,

Reaffirming, among other principles, the sovereign equality of States,
non-intervention and non-interference in their internal affairs and freedom of
international trade and navigation, which are also enshrined in many
international legal instruments,

Recalling the statements of the heads of State and Government at the
Ibero-American Summits concerning the need to eliminate the unilateral
application of economic and trade measures by one State against another which
affect the free flow of international trade,

Taking note of Decision 360 adopted on 13 July 1995 by the Twenty-first
Council of the Latin American Economic System, held at the ministerial level at
San Salvador, which called for the lifting of the economic, commercial and
financial embargo against Cuba,

Concerned about the continued promulgation and application by Member States
of laws and regulations whose extraterritorial effects affect the sovereignty of
other States and the legitimate interests of entities or persons under their
jurisdiction, as well as the freedom of trade and navigation,

Recalling its resolutions 47/19 of 24 November 1992, 48/16 of
3 November 1993 and 49/9 of 26 October 1994,

95-32698 (E) 271095 271095 /...

Concerned that, since the adoption of its resolutions 47/19, 48/16 and
49/9, further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the
economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be
promulgated and applied, and concerned also about the adverse effects of such
measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries,

1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General of 20 September 1995
on the implementation of resolution 49/9; 1/

2. Reiterates its call to all States to refrain from promulgating and
applying laws and measures of the kind referred to in the preamble to the
present resolution in conformity with their obligations under the Charter of the
United Nations and international law which, inter alia, reaffirm the freedom of
trade and navigation;

3. Once again urges States that have and continue to apply such laws and
measures to take the necessary steps to repeal or invalidate them as soon as
possible in accordance with their legal regime;

4. Requests the Secretary-General, in consultation with the appropriate
organs and agencies of the United Nations system, to prepare a report on the
implementation of the present resolution in the light of the purposes and
principles of the Charter and international law, and to submit it to the General
Assembly at its fifty-first session;

5. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-first
session the item entitled "Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and
financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba".
