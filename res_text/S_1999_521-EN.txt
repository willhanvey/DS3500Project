The Security Council,

Reaffirming its resolution 696 (1991) of 30 May 1991 and all subsequent
relevant resolutions, in particular resolutions 864 (1993) of 15 September 1993,

resolution 1229 (1999) of 26 February 1999,

Reaffirming its commitment to preserve the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Angola,

Reiterating that the primary cause of the present crisis in Angola is the
refusal of the União Nacional Para a Independência Total de Angola (UNITA),
under the leadership of Mr. Jonas Savimbi, to comply with its obligations under
the "Acordos de Paz" (S/22609, annex), the Lusaka Protocol (S/1994/1441, annex)
and relevant Security Council resolutions,

Expressing its alarm at the humanitarian effects of the present crisis on
the civilian population of Angola,

Emphasizing its strong concern at reports of the provision of military
assistance, including mercenaries, to UNITA,

Having considered the recommendations contained in section IV of the report
of the Secretary-General of 17 January 1999 (S/1999/49) concerning improving the
implementation of the measures imposed against UNITA, and having endorsed the
recommendations contained in the report of 12 February 1999 (S/1999/147) of the
Committee established pursuant to resolution 864 (1993),

Welcoming the recommendations contained in the letter and its enclosure of
