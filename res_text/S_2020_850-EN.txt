  France: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council,  

 Recalling all its previous resolutions, statements of its President and press 

statements on the situation in Mali,  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, unity and territorial 

integrity of Mali, emphasizing that the Malian authorities have primary responsibility 

for the provision of stability and security throughout the territory of Mali, and 

underscoring the importance of achieving national ownership of peace- and security-

related initiatives,  

 Recalling the provisions of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali 

(“the Agreement”) calling upon the Security Council to give its full support to the 

Agreement, to closely monitor its implementation and, if necessary, to take measures 

against anyone hindering the implementation of the commitments  contained therein 

or the realization of its objectives,  

 Expressing its deep concern regarding the recent developments in Mali, strongly 

condemning the mutiny which happened in Kati, on 18 August 2020, underlining the 

urgent need to restore rule of law and to move towards the return to constitutional 

order, reiterating its strong support to the Economic Community of West African 

States’ (ECOWAS) initiatives and mediation efforts in Mali, and expressing its 

readiness to discuss this matter, in the course of the year, in light of the potential 

implications of these recent developments on the implementation of the Agreement,  

 Recognizing that some progress was made during the past eight months in the 

implementation of the Agreement, and that a combination of some level of political 

will and international pressure, including through the prospect of sanctions, 

constituted important factors in securing this progress, expressing a significant sense 

of impatience with parties over the persistent delays in the full implementation of key 

provisions of the Agreement, further noting that continued delays in implementation 

contribute to a political and security vacuum jeopardizing the stability and 

development of Mali as well as the viability of the Agreement, stressing the need for 

increased ownership and prioritization in the implementation of the Agreement, and 

further stressing the importance of the full, effective and meaningful participation of 

women in the mechanisms established by the Agreement to support and moni tor its 

implementation,  

 Strongly condemning all abuses and violations of human rights and violations 

of international humanitarian law in Mali, calling upon all parties to bring an end to 



S/2020/850 
 

 

20-11321 2/3 

 

such violations and abuses and to comply with their obligations under applicable 

international law, 

 Recalling the provisions of resolution 2531 (2020) urging the Malian parties to 

take immediate and concrete action, in a spirit of genuine cooperation, to fulfil the 

priority measures listed in its paragraph 3 before the end of MINUSMA’s current 

mandate, encouraging the Panel of Experts established pursuant to resolution 2374 

(2017) (“the Panel of Experts”) to identify parties responsible for potential lack of 

implementation of these priority measures through its regular reporting and interim 

updates, and expressing its intent, should these priority measures not be implemented 

by the end of MINUSMA’s current mandate, to respond with measures pursuant to 

resolution 2374 (2017) on individuals and entities who are thus obstructing or 

threatening the implementation of the Agreement,  

 Stressing that all parties to the Agreement share the primary responsibility to 

make steadfast progress in its implementation,  

 Taking note of the decisions of the Security Council Committee established 

pursuant to resolution 2374 (2017) concerning Mali (“the Committee”) of 

20 December 2018 and 10 July 2019 that several individuals be placed on the list of 

individuals and entities subject to measures pursuant to resolution 2374 (2017) (“the 

2374 Sanctions List”) and further taking note of the intention of the Committee to 

consider the removal of these individuals from the 2374 Sanctions List if the priority 

measures listed in paragraph 3 of resolution 2531 (2020) are fully implemented and 

the individuals designated cease all illicit activities, including those listed in the 

statement of case, while stressing that the Security Council has not yet seen sufficient 

progress to merit such consideration,  

 Reiterating that individuals or entities placed on the 2374 Sanctions List shall 

not benefit from any financial, operational or logistical support from United Nations 

entities deployed in Mali, until their removal from the 2374 Sanctions List and 

without prejudice to the exemptions set by paragraphs 2, 5, 6 and 7 of resolution 2374 

(2017), welcoming the measures already taken by United Nations entities deployed in 

Mali to ensure these individuals or entities do not benefit from such support, and 

reiterating its request made in resolution 2531 (2020) for the Secretary-General to 

include in his next quarterly report on MINUSMA an update on these measures,  

 Taking note of the final report (S/2020/785) of the Panel of Experts,  

 Noting the importance of continued cooperation and information exchange 

between the Panel of Experts and all other United Nations entities operating in Mali, 

within their mandates and capabilities,  

 Determining that the situation in Mali continues to constitute a threat to 

international peace and security in the region,  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,
