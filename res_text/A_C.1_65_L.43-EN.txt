which is, inter alia, essential to international peace and security, 

 Reaffirming further the crucial importance of the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons1 as the cornerstone of the international 
nuclear non-proliferation regime and an essential foundation for the pursuit of the 
Treaty’s three pillars, namely nuclear disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and 
the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, 

 Welcoming the successful outcome of the 2010 Review Conference of the 
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, held from 3 to

up meeting of five nuclear-weapon States, to be convened in Paris in 2011,  

 Expressing deep concern regarding the growing dangers posed by the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, inter alia, nuclear weapons, including 
that caused by proliferation networks, 

 Recognizing the importance of the objective of nuclear security, along with the 
shared goals of Member States of nuclear disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation 
and peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and welcoming the Nuclear Security Summit, 
held on 12 and 13 April 2010, which represented a remarkable contribution to 
strengthening nuclear security and reducing the threat of nuclear terrorism, 

 Recognizing also the importance of implementing Security Council resolutions
