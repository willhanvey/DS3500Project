Draft resolution

The Security Council,

Recalling its previous resolutions and statements by its President on the
situation in Liberia and West Africa,

Taking note of the reports of the United Nations Panel of Experts on Liberia
dated 7 August 2003 (S/2003/779) and 28 October 2003 (S/2003/937 and
S/2003/937/Add.1) submitted pursuant to resolution 1478 (2003),

Expressing serious concern at the findings of the Panel of Experts that the
measures imposed by resolution 1343 (2001) continue to be breached, particularly
through the acquisition of arms,

Welcoming the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed by the former
Government of Liberia, Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy
(LURD) and the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL) on 18 August 2003
in Accra, and that the National Transitional Government of Liberia under Chairman
Gyude Bryant took office on 14 October 2003,

Calling upon all States in the region, particularly the National Transitional
Government of Liberia, to work together to build lasting regional peace, including
through the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the
International Contact Group on Liberia, the Mano River Union and the Rabat
Process,

Noting with concern, however, that the ceasefire and the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement are not yet being universally implemented throughout Liberia, and that
much of the country remains outside the authority of the National Transitional
Government of Liberia, particularly those areas to which the United Nations
Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) has not yet deployed,

Recognizing the linkage between the illegal exploitation of natural resources
such as diamonds and timber, illicit trade in such resources, and the proliferation
and trafficking of illegal arms as a major source of fuelling and exacerbating
conflicts in West Africa, particularly in Liberia,

Determining that the situation in Liberia and the proliferation of arms and
armed non-State actors, including mercenaries, in the subregion continue to
constitute a threat to international peace and security in West Africa, in particular to
the peace process in Liberia,

S/2003/1180

Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,

A

Recalling its resolutions 1343 (2001) of 7 March 2001, 1408 (2002) of 6 May

of 19 September 2003,

Noting that the changed circumstances in Liberia, in particular the departure of
former President Charles Taylor and the formation of the National Transitional
Government of Liberia, and progress with the peace process in Sierra Leone, require
the Council’s determination for action under Chapter VII to be revised to reflect
these altered circumstances,

retain links to former President Charles Taylor, those individuals determined by the
Committee to be in violation of paragraph 2 above, and any other individuals, or
individuals associated with entities, providing financial or military support to armed
