 The Security Council 

 Bearing in mind its primary responsibility under the Charter of the United 

Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security, and underlining the 

importance of taking measures aimed at conflict prevention and resolution,  

 Reaffirming its resolutions 1265 (1999), 1296 (2000), 1674 (2006) and 1894 

(2009) on the protection of civilians in armed conflict and its resolution 1738 (2006) 

on the protection of journalists, media professionals and associated personnel in 

armed conflicts as well as other relevant resolutions and presidential statements,  

 Reaffirming its commitment to the Purposes of the Charter of the United 

Nations as set out in Article 1 (1-4) of the Charter, and to the Principles of the 

Charter as set out in Article 2 (1-7) of the Charter, including its commitment to the 

principles of the political independence, sovereign equality and territorial integrity 

of all States, and respect for the sovereignty of all States,  

 Recalling the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, in particular the Third 

Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 on the treatment of prisoners of war, and the 

Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977, in particular article 79 of the Additional 

Protocol I regarding the protection of journalists engaged in dangerous professional 

missions in areas of armed conflict,  

 Recognizing that the work of journalists, media professionals, and associated 

personnel often puts them at specific risk of intimidation, harassment and violence 

in situations of armed conflict, 

 Reaffirming that parties to an armed conflict bear the primary responsibility to 

take all feasible steps to ensure the protection of affected civilians, including t hose 

who exercise their right to freedom of expression by seeking, receiving and 



S/2015/375

disseminating information by different means, online as well as offline, in 

accordance with Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 

Rights, 

 Recognizing the important role of international humanitarian law, and 

international human rights law as applicable, in protecting journalists, media 

professionals and associated personnel in armed conflicts,  

 Further recognizing that States bear the primary responsibility to respect and 

ensure the human rights of their citizens, as well as individuals within their territory 

as provided for by relevant international law,  

 Recalling the right to freedom of expression reflected in Article 19 of the 

Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the General Assembly in 1948 

(“the Universal Declaration”), and recalling also the right to freedom of expression 

in Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights adopted by 

the General Assembly in 1966 (“ICCPR”) and that any restrictions thereon shall 

only be such as are provided by law and are necessary on the grounds set out in 

paragraph 3 of Article 19 of the ICCPR,  

 Deeply concerned at the frequency of acts of violence in many parts of the 

world against journalists, media professionals, and associated personnel in armed 

conflict, in particular deliberate attacks in violation of international humanitarian 

law, 

 Emphasizing that there are existing prohibitions under international 

humanitarian law against attacks intentionally directed against civilians, as such, 

which in situations of armed conflict constitute war crimes, and recalling the need 

for States to end impunity for such criminal acts,  

 Bearing in mind that impunity for crimes committed against journalists, media 

professionals and associated personnel in armed conflict remains a significant 

challenge to their protection and that ensuring accountability for crimes committed 

against them is a key element in preventing future attacks,  

 Recognizing that journalists, media professionals and associated personnel can 

play an important role in protection of civilians and conflict prevention by acting as 

an early warning mechanism in identifying and reporting potential situations that 

could result in genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity,  

 Reaffirming its condemnation of all incitements to violence against civilians in 

situations of armed conflict, and condemning the use of the media to incite violence, 

genocide, crimes against humanity and other serious violations of international 

humanitarian law,  

 Recalling that States Parties to the Geneva Conventions have an obligation to 

search for persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed a 

grave breach of these Conventions, and an obligation to try them before their own 

courts, regardless of their nationality, or may hand them over for trial to another 

concerned State provided this State has made out prima facie case against the said 

persons, 

 Further recalling the responsibility of all Member States to comply with their 

respective obligations to end impunity and to investigate and prosecute those 

responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes or other serious 



 
S/2015/375 

 

3/5 15-08307 

 

violations of international humanitarian law and noting that the fight against 

impunity for the most serious crimes of international concern committed against 

civilians has been strengthened through the work on and prosecution of these crimes 

by the International Criminal Court, in accordance with the principle of 

complementarity to national criminal jurisdictions as set out in the Rome Statute, ad 

hoc and mixed tribunals and specialized chambers in national tribunals,  

 Expressing deep concern at the growing threat to the safety of journalists, 

media professionals, and associated personnel posed by terrorist groups and strongly 

condemning incidents of killings, kidnapping and hostage taking committed by 

terrorist groups for any purpose, including raising funds or gaining political 

concessions, and expressing its determination to prevent kidnapping and hostage 

taking committed by terrorist groups and to secure the safe release of hostages 

without ransom payments or political concessions, in accordance with applicable 

international law,  

 Stressing the contribution that peacekeeping operations and special political 

missions, where mandated, can make to international efforts to promote and protect 

human rights, and the protection of civilians, including journalists, media 

professionals, and associated personnel including through monitoring and reporting 

on violations and abuses as well as providing support for national governments ’ 

efforts to promote and protect human rights, and in order to strengthen the fight 

against impunity for crimes committed against civilians, including journalists, 

media professionals, and associated personnel,  

 Recognizing the importance of a comprehensive, coherent and action-oriented 

approach, including in early planning, of protection of civilians in situations of 

armed conflict. Stressing, in this regard, the need to adopt a broad strategy of 

conflict prevention, which addresses the root causes of armed conflict in a 

comprehensive manner in order to enhance the protection of civilians on a long-

term basis, including by promoting sustainable development, poverty eradication, 

national reconciliation, good governance, democracy, the rule of law and respect for 

and protection of human rights, 

 Acknowledging the important role that regional and sub-regional organisations 

can play in ensuring the protection of journalists, media professionals, and 

associated personnel in armed conflicts and the importance of effective co -operation 

between the United Nations and those organizations,  

 Further acknowledging the specific risks faced by women journalists, media 

professionals and associated personnel in conduct of their work, and underlining in 

this context the importance of considering the gender dimension of measures to 

address their safety in situations of armed conflict,

applicable international humanitarian law and relevant Security Council resolutions 

including those on protection of journalist, media professionals and associated
