deep concern about the devastating impacts of COVID-19 on human health and well-

being, while taking into consideration that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated 

the challenges faced by people in vulnerable situations, noting with concern that sand 

and dust storms may exacerbate the symptoms of respiratory diseases such as 

COVID-19 and may complicate and prolong the recovery from the disease, in addition 

to the other negative impacts that can be associated with respiratory disorders such as 

asthma, tracheitis, pneumonia and silicosis, which may lead to chronic obstructive 

pulmonary disease and cardiovascular and heart disorders, in addition to eye and skin 

irritation, and can also spread other diseases, such as meningitis, and taking into 

account that a reduction in cardiovascular and respiratory disease, as comorbidities 

linked to COVID-19-related deaths, can produce significant health benefits, when 

mitigating measures are taken,

development of affected countries and regions, also recognizes that, in the past few 

years, sand and dust storms have inflicted substantial economic, social and 

environmental damage on the inhabitants of the world’s arid, semi-arid and dry 

subhumid areas, especially in Africa and Asia, and underscores the need to treat them 

and to promptly take measures to address those challenges;  

 3. Recalls the convening of a high-level interactive dialogue on sand and dust 

storms, held at Headquarters in New York on 16 July 2018, bringing together Member 

States, observer States and observers of the General Assembly, United Nations system
