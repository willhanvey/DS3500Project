 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General (S/2014/740), as requested by 

resolution 2125 (2013), on the implementation of that resolution and on the 

situation with respect to piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia,

independence, and unity of Somalia, including Somalia’s sovereign rights in 

accordance with international law, with respect to offshore natural resources, 

including fisheries,  

 While noting that the joint counter-piracy efforts of States, regions, 

organizations, the maritime industry, the private sector, think tanks, and civil society 

have resulted in a sharp decline in pirate attacks as well as hijackings since 2011 , 

continuing to be gravely concerned by the on-going threat that piracy and armed 

robbery at sea pose to the prompt, safe, and effective delivery of humanitarian aid to

facilitate, or illicitly finance or profit from such attacks, and reiterating its concern 

over persons suspected of piracy having been released without facing justice, 

reaffirming that the failure to prosecute persons responsible for acts of piracy and 

armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia undermines anti -piracy efforts, 

 Further reaffirming that international law, as reflected in the United Nations 

Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (“The Convention”), sets 

out the legal framework applicable to activities in the ocean, including countering 

piracy and armed robbery at sea, 

 Underlining the primary responsibility of the Somali authorities in the fight 

against piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, noting the several

Pirate Networks Ashore of the CGPCS to disrupt illicit financial flows linked to 

piracy, 

 Welcoming the financing provided by the Trust Fund to Support Initiatives of 

States Combating Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (the Trust Fund) to strengthen 

regional ability to prosecute suspected pirates and imprison those convicted in 

accordance with applicable international human rights law, noting with appreciation 

the assistance provided by the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) 

Maritime Crime Programme, and being determined to continue efforts to ensure that

Somalia and the naval activities of the Southern Africa Development Community, 

and other States acting in a national capacity in cooperation with Somali authorities 

and each other to suppress piracy and to protect ships transiting through the waters 

off the coast of Somalia, and welcoming the Shared Awareness and Deconfliction 

Initiative (SHADE) and the efforts of individual countries, including China, India, 

the Islamic Republic of Iran, Japan, Republic of Korea, and the Russian Federation, 



 
S/2014/803 

 

3/9 14-64604 

 

which have deployed naval counter-piracy missions in the region, as stated in the 

Secretary-General’s report (S/2014/740), 

 Noting the efforts of flag States for taking measures to permit vessels sailing 

under their flag transiting the High Risk Area (HRA) to embark vessel protection 

detachments and privately contracted armed security personnel (PCASP), and 

encouraging States to regulate such activities in accordance with applicable 

international law and permit charters to favour arrangements that make use of such 

measures, 

 Noting the request of some Member States on the need to review the 

boundaries of the HRA on an objective and transparent basis, taking into account 

actual incidents of piracy, and noting that the HRA is set and defined by the 

insurance and maritime industry,

Nestor, which is working to develop the sea-going maritime security capacities of 

Somalia, Djibouti, Seychelles, and Tanzania,  

 Noting with concern that the continuing limited capacity and domestic 

legislation to facilitate the custody and prosecution of suspected pirates after their 

capture has hindered more robust international action against the pirates off the 

coast of Somalia, too often has led to pirates being released without facing justice, 

regardless of whether there is sufficient evidence to support prosecution, and 

reiterating that, consistent with the provisions of The Convention concerning the 

repression of piracy, the 1988 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts 

Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (“SUA Convention”) provides for parties 

to create criminal offences, establish jurisdiction, and accept delivery of persons 

responsible for or suspected of seizing or exercising control over a ship by force or 

threat thereof or any other form of intimidation,

 Further recognizing that pirate networks continue to rely on kidnapping and 

hostage-taking to help generate funding to purchase weapons, gain recruits, and 

continue their operational activities, thereby jeopardizing the safety and security of 

civilians and restricting the flow of commerce, and welcoming international efforts 

to coordinate the work of investigators and prosecutors, inter alia, through the Law 

Enforcement Task Force and collect and share information to disrupt the pirate 

enterprise, as exemplified by INTERPOL’s Global Database on Maritime Piracy, 

and taking note of the on-going efforts of the Regional Fusion and Law Enforcement 

Centre for Safety and Security at Sea, hosted by Seychelles to combat piracy and 

transnational organized crime, 

 Reaffirming international condemnation of acts of kidnapping and hostage-

taking, including offences contained within the International Convention against the 

Taking of Hostages, strongly condemning the continuing practice of hostage-taking 

by pirates operating off the coast of Somalia, expressing serious concern at the 

inhumane conditions hostages face in captivity, recognizing the adverse impact on 

their families, calling for the immediate release of all hostages, and noting the

elsewhere, pirates, including facilitators and financiers ashore, consistent with 

applicable international human rights law, and emphasizing the need for States and 

international organizations to further enhance international efforts in this regard, 

 Welcoming the readiness of the national and regional administrations of 

Somalia to cooperate with each other and with States who have prosecuted 

suspected pirates with a view to enabling convicted pirates to be repatriated back t o 

Somalia under suitable prisoner transfer arrangements, consistent with applicable 

international law, including international human rights law, and acknowledging the 

return from Seychelles to Somalia of convicted prisoners willing and eligible to 

serve their sentences in Somalia, 

 Recalling the reports of the Secretary General (S/2011/360 and S/2012/50) 

which illustrate the seriousness of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of 

Somalia and provide useful guidance for the investigation and prosecution of 

pirates, including on specialized anti-piracy courts, 

 Stressing the need for States to consider possible methods to assist the 

seafarers who are victims of pirates, and welcoming in this regard the efforts of the 

“Hostage Support Programme” and the new Piracy Survivor Family Fund launched 

at the recent CGPCS to provide support to hostages during their release and return 

home, as well as to their families throughout the hostage situation,

 Further noting with appreciation the on-going efforts by UNODC to support 

efforts to enhance Somalia’s maritime security and law enforcement capacities, also 

noting efforts by UNODC and UNDP and the funding provided by the Trust Fund, 

the European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other donors to 

develop regional judicial and law enforcement capacity to investigate, arrest, and 

prosecute suspected pirates and to incarcerate convicted pirates consistent with 

applicable international human rights law,  

 Bearing in mind the Djibouti Code of Conduct concerning the Repression of 

Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in the Western Indian Ocean and the Gulf 

of Aden, noting the operations of information-sharing centres in Yemen, Kenya, and 

Tanzania and the regional maritime training centre in Djibouti, and recognizing the 

efforts of signatory States to develop the appropriate regulatory and legislative 

frameworks to combat piracy, enhance their capacity to patrol the waters of the 

region, interdict suspect vessels, and prosecute suspected pirates, 

 Emphasizing that peace and stability within Somalia, the strengthening of 

State institutions, economic and social development, and respect for human rights 

and the rule of law are necessary to create the conditions for a durable eradication of

armed robbery at sea off its coast are inextricably linked, and stressing the need to 

continue the comprehensive response by the international community to repress 

piracy and armed robbery at sea and tackle its underlying causes, recognizing the 

need to undertake long-term and sustainable efforts to repress piracy and the need to 

create adequate economic opportunities for the citizens of Somalia,  

 Determining that the incidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast 

of Somalia, as well as the activity of pirate groups in Somalia, are an important 

factor exacerbating the situation in Somalia, which continues to constitute a threat 

to international peace and security in the region,

 1. Reiterates that it condemns and deplores all acts of piracy and armed 

robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia; 

 2. Recognizes that the on-going instability in Somalia is one of the 

underlying causes of the problem of piracy and contributes to the problem of piracy 

and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, while piracy, in turn, exacerbates
