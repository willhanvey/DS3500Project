 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 

territorial integrity of all States in the region and emphasizing the need to respect 

fully the principles of non-interference, good-neighbourliness and regional 

cooperation,  

 Recalling that the Governments of the region bear the primary responsibility to 

protect civilians within their territories and subject to their jurisdiction, including 

protection from crimes against humanity and war crimes,  

 Expressing concern over the significant increase in the numbers of refugees 

and internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Great Lakes region over the pa st year, 

totalling now more than 7 million internally displaced persons and 3.5 million 

refugees, and stressing the link between forced displacement and instability and 

insecurity in the region,  

 Reiterating its deep concern regarding the security and humanitarian crisis in 

the DRC exacerbated by destabilizing activities of foreign and domestic armed 

groups, stressing the importance of neutralizing armed groups in the DRC, and 

recognizing the importance of efforts of the Forces Armées de la République 

démocratique du Congo (FARDC) and the United Nations Organization

operations, in accordance with its mandate as stipulated in resolution 2348 (2017),  

 Welcoming the credible and peaceful conduct of elections in some States of the 

Great Lakes region, and noting, however, that recent and ongoing electoral 

processes in some countries of the Great Lakes region raise deep concerns about the 

risk of instability, insecurity, the potential for violence, human rights violations and 

abuses and violations of international humanitarian law and further displacement of 

people which impact all countries of the Great Lakes region,  

 Expressing concern at the illicit flow of weapons within and into the DRC, 

including their recirculation to and between armed groups, in violation of resolution 

2360 (2017), and declaring its determination to continue to monitor closely the 

implementation of the arms embargo and other measures set out by its resolutions

on protected natural areas, which undermines lasting peace and development for the 

DRC, and encouraging the Government of the DRC to strengthen efforts to 

safeguard those areas,  

 Recalling the linkage between the illegal exploitation and trade of natural 

resources, including poaching and illegal trafficking of wildlife, and the 

proliferation and trafficking of arms as one of the major factors fuelling and 

exacerbating conflicts in the Great Lakes region, and encouraging the continuation 

of the regional efforts of the International Conference of the Great Lakes Region 

(ICGLR) and the governments involved against the illegal exploitation of natural 

resources, and stressing, in this regard, the importance of regional cooperation and 

deepening economic integration with special consideration for the exploitation of

Great Lakes Region and the PSC Framework for the Democratic Republic of the 

Congo and the region are mutually reinforcing, and are crucial tools to achieve long 

term peace and prosperity, emphasizing that the PSC Framework demonstrates that 

peace, security and development are interlinked and underscores the importance of 

strengthening regional cooperation, including the deepening of economic 

integration,
