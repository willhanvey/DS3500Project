Expressing its full support for the efforts of the High Commissioner for Human

(S/2003/211),

Commending the Government of Angola for its efforts in ensuring the

which establishes the basis for a settlement in the Ituri area, and expressing its
gratitude to the Government of Angola for their readiness to continue these efforts,

Commending also the Government of South Africa for its role in cooperation

Determining that the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
continues to pose a threat to international peace and security in the region,

1. Welcomes the agreement reached by the Congolese parties in Pretoria on
6 March 2003 on the transitional arrangements, commends the Congolese parties,
whose responsibility it is to implement fully the commitments they have taken, for
their efforts in settling the outstanding issues, and calls on them to establish as soon
as possible the transitional government in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
and stresses that any effort to undermine or delay its establishment would be
unacceptable;

S/2003/334

Congo (MLC) and the Rassemblement Congolais pour la Démocratie/National
(RCD/N) troops, as well as the acts of violence recently perpetrated by the Union
des Patriotes Congolais (UPC) forces, and reiterates that there will be no impunity
for such acts and that the perpetrators will be held accountable;

3. Stresses that the military officers whose names are mentioned in the
report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in connection
with serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights should
be brought to justice, through further investigation, and if warranted by that
investigation, held accountable through a credible judicial process;

4. Calls upon the Congolese parties, when selecting individuals for key
posts in the transitional government, to take into account the commitment and record
of those individuals with regard to respect for International Humanitarian Law and
human rights and the promotion of the well-being of all the Congolese;

5. Strongly encourages the Congolese parties forming the transitional
government to establish as soon as possible a Truth and Reconciliation Commission
charged with determining responsibility for serious violations of international
humanitarian and human rights law, as set forth in the resolutions adopted in the
framework of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue in Sun City in April 2002;

6. Reiterates that all parties claiming a role in the future of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo must demonstrate their respect for human rights,
International Humanitarian Law, as well as the security and well-being of civilian
populations and emphasizes that the transitional government in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo will have to restore law and order and respect for human
rights, and end impunity, across the entire country;

7. Requests the Secretary-General to increase the number of personnel in
MONUC’s human rights component to assist and enhance, in accordance with its
current mandate, the capacity of the Congolese parties to investigate all the serious
violations of international humanitarian law and human rights perpetrated on the
territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo since the beginning of the
conflict in August 1998, and requests also the Secretary-General, in consultation
with the High Commissioner for Human Rights, to make recommendations to the
Council on other ways to help the transitional government in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo address the issue of impunity;

8. Expresses its deep concern over the heavy fighting in Bunia, demands
that all parties to the conflict in Ituri immediately cease the hostilities and that all
parties sign an unconditional ceasefire agreement, stresses that they must cooperate
with MONUC to set up without further delay the Ituri Pacification Commission, and
also stresses that the necessary steps must be taken to restore public order in Bunia,
in accordance with the agreements reached among Congolese parties and within the
framework of the Ituri Pacification Commission;

9. Requests the Secretary-General to increase MONUC’s presence in the
Ituri area, as security conditions permit, in particular military observers and human
rights personnel, to monitor developments on the ground, including the use of
airfields in the Ituri area, and also requests MONUC to provide further support and
assistance to humanitarian efforts as well as to facilitate the formation of the Ituri
Pacification Commission and assist the work of this commission as consistent with

S/2003/334

MONUC’s current mandate, in consultation with all the Congolese parties to the
conflict;

possible options for addressing the immediate security situation in the Ituri area and
requests that MONUC keep the Council informed of its efforts in this regard;

11. Demands that all governments in the Great Lakes region immediately
cease military and financial support to all the parties engaged in armed conflict in
the Ituri region, stresses the need for all Congolese parties, including the
Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to respect their commitments
under the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement, as well as the Kampala plan and the Harare
sub-plans for disengagement and redeployment, and reiterates that all foreign troops
must be withdrawn from the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo;

12. Calls on the Government of Uganda to complete the withdrawal of all its
troops without further delay and, in this regard, expresses its concern that that
Government’s commitment to withdraw by 20 March 2003 has not been met, and,
concerned also at the statement of 14 March 2003 issued by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and Regional Cooperation of Rwanda, calls on the Government of Rwanda
not to return any forces to the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
and stresses that any renewal of strengthening of foreign military presence on the
territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo would be unacceptable and would
undermine the progress achieved thus far in the peace process;

13. Expresses its deep concern at the rising tensions between Rwanda and
Uganda and their proxies on the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
and stresses that the governments of these two countries must take steps to build
mutual confidence, must settle their concerns through peaceful means, and without
any interference in Congolese affairs, and must refrain from any action that could
undermine the peace process;

14. Demands also that all the parties to the conflict in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, and in particular in Ituri, ensure the security of civilian
populations and grant to MONUC and to humanitarian organizations full and
unimpeded access to the populations in need;

15. Reiterates its demand expressed in its resolution 1460 that all parties to
the conflict provide information without delay on steps they have taken to halt their
recruitment or use of children in armed conflict in violation of the international
obligations applicable to them, as well as its demands with regard to the protection
of children contained in its resolutions 1261, 1314, 1379 and 1460;

16. Recalls its demand that full and unimpeded access be granted to MONUC
and the Third Party Verification Mechanism so that it could verify the
implementation of the Pretoria Agreement of 30 July 2002 and investigate the
allegations on the presence of Rwandan troops in the territory of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, as well as allegations of support by the Government of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo to the armed groups in the east of the country,
reiterates that both would be unacceptable and would undermine the continuation of
the peace process, and stresses that any ongoing military activity in the east of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo has a detrimental effect on MONUC’s operations
of disarmament, demobilization, repatriation, reintegration or resettlement
(DDRRR) of armed groups;
