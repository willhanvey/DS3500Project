Declaration on International Co-operation for Disarmament

The General Assembly,

Recalling once again the affirmation in the Charter of the United nations of
the determination of the peoples of the United Nations to save succeeding
generations from the scourge of war and to this end to unite their strength to
maintain international peace and security~

Stressing again the importance of the recommendations and decisions adopted by
the General Assembly at its tenth special session, devoted to disarmament, and
recalling the principles proclaimed in the Final Document of that session, ~

Convinced that there is an urgent need for active and combined efforts further
to intensify the comprehensive implementation of the recommendations and decisions
unanimously adopted at its tenth special session and that, to this end, a continuing
and sustained effort by all States, in a more co-ordinated manner and on the basis
of ".Jorld-1vide co-operation in the interests of security and peace~ is essential,

Recallinp; the Declaration on Principles of International La",! concerning
Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance "ith the Charter
of the United Nations, ~ in which the General Assembly proclaimed the duty of all
States to pursue in good faith negotiations for the early conclusion of a universal
treaty on general and complete disarmament and to strive to adopt appronriate
measures to reduce international tensions and strengthen confidence among States j

Stressinr; the inalienable right of every nation and every human beine to live
in peace j free from the threat of war j in freedom and independence, as was

Societies for Life in Peace, l/ the strict observance of 1lhich is in the highest
interests of mankind and is an essential prerequisite for its full development,

Conscious that a dynamic development of detente in all spheres of international
relations throughout the world 1lould contribute to the achievement of the aims of
disarmament,

Deeply disturbed by the fact that internacional peace and security of peoples
continue to be threatened by the arms race, particularly in the nuclear field,
and the accumulation of stockpiles of hip,hly destructive weapons and that at the
saroe tiue the continuation of the arms race conflicts ,dth the interest of the
econonic development and tile social and spiritual progress of mankind,

Noting in particular that the arms race is incompatible with and contrary to
the efforts directed to the establishment of the new international economic order,

Stressin~ that the Governments of all countries, particularly of nuclear-weapon
Sta.tes ~ bear a historic responsibility for eliminating Tdar from human life, primarily
through the adoption of effective and decisive dj.sarmament measures aimed at the
achievement of roeneral and complete disarmament under strict and effective
international control,

Noting that specia~ responsibility for achieving general and complete
disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, and for averting nuclear \·lar rests
~!ith all States possessing nuclear weapons and other militarily significant states j

Proceeding from the principle that the effective j constructive and continuing
co~o~eration among all States based on mutual confidence and political ~illj
irrespective of their social system and level of economic develo~ment is essential
for the achievement of disarmament and the attainment of its goals j

Convinced that such co-operation must be demonstrated, developed and
intensified in mutual contacts and in any forum where States conduct negotiations
on disarmament j particularly in the Committee on Disarmament, in order that the
aims of the negotiations may be achieved as speedily as possible j

Convinced also that such co-operation must express a common determination by
States to bring about a decisive shift in disarmament nee;otiations and, at the same
time, must be sustained by the creation of a favourable atmosphere of trust in
relations amonG States j

Bcarinf; in mind the central role and prim2.ry responsibility of the United
Nations in promoting the unitinr, of efforts and tbe establish~ent of co-operation

session, and to that end, in particular:

(a) To take initiatives aimed at eliminating the threat of nuclear war and
adopting effective new measures to halt and reverse the arms race and pave the way
for the ultimate objective of the efforts in the disarmament process, that is
general and complete disarmament under effective international control;

(b) To exercise actively their inalienable right to take part in disarmament
negotiations, as confirmed by the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the
General Assembly;

(c) To participate actively, as appropriate, in measures taken in the field
of disarmament, bearing in mind the interests of maintaining both international and
national security in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, and actively
to promote such measures;

(d) To conduct disarmament negotiations in good faith on all priority items
concurrently, including appropriate confidence-building measures, with a view to
ensuring that such negotiations will complement one another and will be conducive
to the early achievement of a decisive breakthrough in the sphere of disarmament;

(e) To make every effort to secure continuous and accelerated progress in the
negotiations on halting the arms race and achieving disarmament and~ to these ends,
to refrain from impeding such negotiations, in particular with issues unrelated to
disarmament;

(f) To strive in the course of disarmament negotiations to ensure that they
outstrip the Qualitative development and stockpiling of weapons to which the
negotiations relate and, wherever possible, to prevent the emergence of new types
of weapons and weapon systems, particularly weapons of mass destruction;

(g) To ensure that mUltilateral, regional and bilateral negotiations on
disarmament questions are consistently conducted in accordance with the respective
provisions of the Final Document, bearing in mind that the United Nations has a
central role and primary responsibility in the sphere of disarmament;

(h) To develop joint efforts in achieving concrete disarmament measures the
implementation of which would progressively enable a significant portion of the
resources made available through such measures to be used for social and economic
needs, thus contributing to the bridging of the economic gap between developed and
developing countries, taking into account the close relationship between disarmament
and development;

Urges all States, with a view to further improving the international climate
required for the full implementation of the Final Document of the Tenth Special
Session of the General Assembly and accelerating the progress of the appropriate
disarmament negotiations, in particular:

(a) To cxert determined efforts to expedite measures and pursue policies to
strengthen international peace and security and to build confidence among States

of a favourable international atmosphere which would be conducive to the
strengthening of international peace and security;

(b) To take effective measures for setting in motion the security system
provided for in the Charter of the United Nations and to strengthen it by
eliminating tensions and settling disputes by peaceful means, and to these ends, in
particular, to refrain from seeking military superiority and from any other steps
which might adversely affect efforts in the field of disarmament, and accordingly
to refrain from using their military potential for aggressive purposes, notably the
threat or use of force against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political
independence of any State or against peoples under colonial or foreign domination
which are striving to exercise their right to self-determination and the achievement
of independence, or for interference in the internal affairs of other States;

(c) To strive consistently for the repudiation of all concepts which are
based on military intimidation and policies of acting from a position of strength
and which lead to the intensification or perpetuation of the arms race and the
further accumulation of armaments;

(d) To affirm, wherever possible, in their constitutional norms or by any
other appropriate means, their political will and determination to promote with all
their strength the cause of peace and international security and the achievement of
progress in the field of disarmament;

(e) To intensify steps, both through the United Nations system and
individually, to promote a better understanding by world opinion of the danger of
the arms race and the need for disarmament, and to ensure that world opinion
exerts a positive influence on the efforts of Governments to resolve disarmament
issues, utilizing to this end the educational systems, the mass media and all other
appropriate institutions;

(f) On the basis of the principles of the Charter, to take all appropriate
measures, including legislative ones, to prevent and prohibit propaganda for war
and the arms race and the dissemination of views asserting their necessity or
usefulness on political, economic or other grounds;

(g) To take vigorous measures, individually or collectively, to disseminate
the ideals of peace, disarmament, co-operation and friendly relations between
peoples;

principles of international law, as well as by their adherence to the principles

security of the entire international community will be strengthened and that the
principle of undiminished security of each party will not be impaired;
