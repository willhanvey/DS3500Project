achieving and maintaining a nuclear-weapon-free world, and noting further with 

satisfaction the prominence accorded to the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons 

in multilateral disarmament forums,  

 Recalling the discussions held at the Conferences on the Humanitarian Impact 

of Nuclear Weapons, hosted by Norway on 4 and 5 March 2013, by Mexico on  

13 and 14 February 2014 and by Austria on 8 and 9 December 2014, aimed at 

understanding and developing a greater awareness of the catastrophic consequences 

of nuclear weapons detonations which further reinforce the urgency of nuclear 

disarmament, 

 Emphasizing the compelling evidence presented at the Conferences on the 

Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons which detailed the catastrophic 

consequences that would result from a nuclear weapon detonation, reaching well 

beyond national borders; the lack of capacity of States and international 

organizations to deal with the aftermath, and the risk of an occurrence, due to an 

accident, systems failure or human error,  

 Noting in particular the research findings presented to the Vienna Conference 

regarding the strongly disproportionate and gendered impact of exposure to ionizing 

radiation for women and girls,  

 Recalling the convening, on 26 September 2013, of the high -level meeting of 

the General Assembly on nuclear disarmament and resolution 69/58 of 2 December 

2014, entitled “Follow-up to the 2013 high-level meeting of the General Assembly 

on nuclear disarmament”, and the decisions contained therein, and welcoming the 

commemoration and promotion of 26 September as the International Day for the 

Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons,

 Review Conferences of the Parties 

to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and in particular the 

unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon States to accomplish the total 

elimination of their nuclear arsenals, leading to nuclear disar mament, in accordance 

with commitments made under article VI of the Treaty on the Non -Proliferation of 

Nuclear Weapons,
7
 

 Reaffirming the commitment of all States parties to the Treaty on the 

Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to apply the principles of irreversibility, 

verifiability and transparency in relation to the implementation of their treaty 

obligations, 

 Recognizing the continued vital importance of the entry into force of the 

Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty
8
 to the advancement of nuclear 

disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation objectives, and welcoming the recent 

ratification of the Treaty by Angola,  

 Recalling that the total elimination of nuclear weapons is the only absolute 

guarantee against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons and the legitimate 

interest of non-nuclear-weapon States in receiving unequivocal and legally binding 

negative security assurances from nuclear-weapon States pending the total 

elimination of nuclear weapons,  

 Reaffirming the conviction that, pending the total elimination of nuclear 

weapons, the establishment and maintenance of nuclear-weapon-free zones 

enhances global and regional peace and security, strengthens the nuclear 

non-proliferation regime and contributes towards realizing the objectives of nuclear  

disarmament, and welcoming the Conferences of States Parties and Signatories to 

Treaties that Establish Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones and Mongolia,  

 Welcoming the ratification by China, France, the Russian Federation and the 

United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of the Protocol to the Treaty 

on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia, and urging those States to continue 

to make real progress towards strengthening all existing nuclear -weapon-free zones 

through, inter alia, the withdrawal or revision of any reservations or interpretative 

declarations contrary to the object and purpose of the treaties establishing such 

zones, 

 Recalling the encouragement expressed at the 2010 Review Conference for the 

establishment of further nuclear-weapon-free zones, on the basis of arrangements 

freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned, reaffirming the 

expectation that this will be followed by concerted international efforts to create 

such zones in areas where they do not currently exist, especially in the Middle East, 

and, in this context, noting with deep disappointment the non -fulfilment of the 

agreement at the 2010 Review Conference on practical steps to fully implement the 

1995 resolution on the Middle East, and disappointed that no agreement could be 

reached at the 2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the

Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, held in New York from 27 April to 22 May 

2015, on this issue, 

 Deeply disappointed at the continued absence of progress towards multilateral 

negotiations on nuclear disarmament, in particular in the Conference on 

Disarmament, 

 Deeply regretting the lack of any substantive outcome of the 2015 Review 

Conference,  

 Disappointed that the 2015 Review Conference missed an opportunity to 

further strengthen the Treaty, enhance progress towards its full implementation and 

universality, and monitor the implementation of commitments made and actions 

agreed at the 1995, 2000 and 2010 Review Conferences, and concerned about the 

impact of this failure on the Treaty and the balance among its three pillars,  

 Acknowledging the ongoing efforts towards the full implementation of the 

Treaty between the Russian Federation and the United States of  America on 

Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, 

while re-emphasizing the encouragement of the 2010 Review Conference to both 

States to continue discussions on follow-on measures in order to achieve deeper 

reductions in their nuclear arsenals,

Review, pursuant to actions 5, 20 and 21 of the Final Document of the 2010 Review 

Conference,
9
 and taking note also of the first edition of a glossary of key nuclear  

terms,  

 1. Reiterates that each article of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 

Nuclear Weapons is binding on the States parties at all times and in all 

circumstances and that all States parties should be held fully accountable with 

respect to strict compliance with their obligations under the Treaty, and calls upon 

all States parties to comply fully with all decisions, resolutions and commitments 

made at the 1995, 2000 and 2010 Review Conferences;  

 2. Also reiterates the deep concern expressed by the 2010 Review 

Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 

Weapons at the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear 

weapons, and the need for all States at all times to comply with applicable 

international law, including international humanitarian law;
