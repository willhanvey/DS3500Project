2030 (2011), 2048 (2012) and 2092 (2013), 

 Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on Guinea-Bissau, dated 
6 May 2013 (S/2013/262) and the recommendations contained therein, and 
welcoming the activities undertaken by the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding 
Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS), despite the political and security challenges 
in the field, 

 Remaining seriously concerned about the situation in Guinea-Bissau since the 
military coup of 12 April 2012 and by the fact that despite the progress made due to 
the continuing efforts of UNIOGBIS and subregional, regional and international 
partners to help resolve the crisis, constitutional order has still not been restored in 
Guinea-Bissau, 

 Stressing that the consolidation of peace and stability in Guinea-Bissau can 
only result from a consensual, inclusive and nationally owned transition process, the 
restoration of and respect for constitutional order, the reforms in the defence, 
security and justice sectors, the promotion of the rule of law, the protection of 
human rights, the promotion of socioeconomic development and the fight against 
impunity and drug trafficking, 

 Taking note of the recent important political developments in Guinea-Bissau 
and of the intention of key stakeholders to revise the transitional political pact 
including setting technically feasible deadlines for the holding of free, fair and 
transparent presidential and legislative elections in line with national legislation and 
relevant international standards; taking note also of the signing of the “Agreement 
of Principles for the return to constitutional normalcy” on 30 April 2013, by all 
political parties, military, civil society groups and religious leaders by which they 
decided to extend the transition period until 31 December 2013, with elections to be 
held in November 2013; to form an all-inclusive transitional Government; and to 
elect the President of the National Electoral Commission upon receipt of a proposal 
from the Supreme Court’s Council of Judges, 

 Stressing that all stakeholders in Guinea-Bissau should work to ensure short, 
medium and long-term stability through clear commitment and genuine inclusive

political dialogue aimed at creating conditions conducive to the restoration of and 
respect for constitutional order following credible elections that will be acceptable 
to all and conducive to finding viable and sustainable solutions to the country’s 
social, economic, political and military problems, which would facilitate the 
implementation of key reforms and the strengthening of State Institutions, 

 Deploring the continued lack of effective civilian control and oversight over 
the defence and security forces, which hampers the political process and effective 
functioning of State institutions, as a result of collusion between some political 
actors and the military leadership, 

 Welcoming the efforts of Economic Community of West African States 
(ECOWAS) to support the security sector reform (SSR) process in Guinea-Bissau 
namely through the activities of its Mission in Guinea-Bissau (ECOMIB),

abuses of human rights, as well as the atmosphere of political tension in Guinea-
Bissau, and condemning restrictions on freedom of expression and freedom of 
assembly and of the press, 

 Reiterating its deep concern at the reported increase in drug trafficking in 
Guinea-Bissau since the military coup of 12 April 2012, and at the threat it poses to 
stability, re-emphasizing the need to tackle the problem of drug trafficking in the 
countries of origin, transit and final destination through an approach of common and 
shared responsibility, 

 Underlining that any lasting solution to instability in Guinea-Bissau should 
include concrete actions to fight impunity and ensure that those responsible for 
politically-motivated assassinations and other serious crimes such as drug 
trafficking-related activities and breaches of constitutional order are brought to 
justice, including through transitional justice mechanisms, 

 Reiterating the importance of the continued support of the United Nations and, 
international, regional, subregional, and bilateral partners for the long-term security 
and development of Guinea-Bissau, particularly towards the restoration of 
constitutional order, the implementation of security and justice sectors reforms, the 
fight against drug trafficking, organized crime and human trafficking, as well as the 
creation of an enabling environment for good governance and inclusive social and 
economic development, 

 Commending the important work of the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
Crime (UNODC) in collaboration with the United Nations relevant entities in the 
fight against drug trafficking and transnational organized crime in Guinea-Bissau 
and the subregion, regretting the closure of the UNODC in Guinea-Bissau for lack 
of funding, and looking forward to the reinstatement of UNODC at the appropriate 
time and encouraging enhanced cooperation between UNODC and UNIOGBIS, 

 Stressing the urgent need to maintain in Guinea-Bissau continuous evaluation 
capacity and to continue to support national, subregional, regional and international 
institutions in charge of the fight against drug trafficking,

closely coordinate their actions to help bring solutions to the country’s political, 
security and development challenges; in this regard, welcoming the efforts made by 
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Guinea-Bissau to help ensure 
that all international actors involved in addressing the situation in Guinea-Bissau 
speak with one voice; looking forward to receiving the conclusions and

inclusive transitional government and to adopt a consensual road map with the
