Recalling its resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, containing the

Recognizing that the eradication of colonialism is one of the priorities of
the Organization for the decade that began in 1990,

Deeply conscious of the need to take, speedily, measures to eliminate the
last vestiges of colonialism by the year 2000, as called for in its resolution
43/47 of 22 November 1988,

Noting with satisfaction the achievements of the Special Committee in
contributing to the effective and complete implementation of the Declaration and
other relevant resolutions of the United Nations on decolonization,

Stressing the importance of the participation of the administering Powers
in the work of the Special Committee,

Also noting with satisfaction the cooperation and active participation of
some administering Powers in the work of the Special Committee, as well as their
continued readiness to receive United Nations visiting missions in the
Territories under their administration,

Noting with concern the negative impact which the non-participation of
certain administering Powers has had on the work of the Special Committee,
depriving it of an important source of information on the Territories under
their administration,

Aware of the pressing need of newly independent and emerging States for
assistance from the United Nations and its system of organizations in the
economic, social and other fields,

Aware also of the pressing need of the remaining Non-Self-Governing
Territories, including particularly the small island Territories, for economic,
social and other assistance from the United Nations and the organizations within
its system,

Taking special note of the fact that, during its 1995 session, the Special
Committee carried out a mid-term review of the Plan of Action for the
International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism in the context of the
commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations in which further
options for self-determination were explored,

1. Reaffirms its resolution 1514 (XV) and all other resolutions on
decolonization, including its resolution 43/47, in which it declared the decade
that began in 1990 as the International Decade for the Eradication of
Colonialism, and calls upon the administering Powers, in accordance with those
resolutions, to take all necessary steps to enable the peoples of the
Territories concerned to exercise fully as soon as possible their right to self-
determination, including independence;

2. Affirms once again that the continuation of colonialism in any form or
manifestation - including economic exploitation - is incompatible with the
Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 2/
and the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples;

3. Reaffirms its determination to continue to take all steps necessary to
bring about the complete and speedy eradication of colonialism and the faithful
observance by all States of the relevant provisions of the Charter, the

2/ Resolution 217 A (III).

recommendations of the Special Committee for the implementation of the

foreign economic and other interests in the Non-Self-Governing Territories under

their right to self-determination, including independence;

8. Takes note of the decision of some of the administering Powers to
close or downsize some of the military bases in the Non-Self-Governing
Territories;

9. Calls upon the administering Powers to eliminate the remaining
military bases in the Non-Self-Governing Territories in compliance with the
relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, and urges them not to involve
those Territories in any offensive acts or interference against other States;

10. Urges all States, directly and through their action in the specialized
agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, to provide moral
and material assistance to the peoples of colonial Territories, and requests
that the administering Powers, in consultation with the Governments of the
Territories under their administration, take steps to enlist and make effective
use of all possible assistance, on both a bilateral and a multilateral basis, in
the strengthening of the economies of those Territories;

11. Requests the Special Committee to continue to seek suitable means for
the immediate and full implementation of the Declaration and to carry out those
actions approved by the General Assembly regarding the International Decade for
the Eradication of Colonialism in all Territories that have not yet exercised
their right to self-determination, including independence, and in particular:
