 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming its resolutions 1261 (1999) of 25 August 1999, 1314 (2000) of  

11 August 2000, 1379 (2001) or 20 November 2001, 1460 (2003) of 30 January 

2003, 1539 (2004) of 22 April 2004, 1612 (2005) of 26 July 2005, 1882 (2009) of  

4 August 2009, 1998 (2011) of 12 July 2011, 2068 (2012) of 19 September 2012, 

2143 (2014) of 7 March 2014, and all relevant Statements of its President, which 

contribute to a comprehensive framework for addressing the protection of children 

affected by armed conflict, 

 Reiterating its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international 

peace and security and, in this connection, its commitment to address the 

widespread impact of armed conflict on children,  

 Acknowledging that its resolutions, their implementation and the Statements of 

its President on children and armed conflict as well as the conclusions of the 

Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict have generated 

progress in preventing and responding to violations and abuses committed against 

children, in particular in the demobilization, rehabilitation and reintegration of  

thousands of children, the signing of action plans between parties to armed conflict 

and the delisting of parties to conflict from the Annexes to the Secretary -General’s 

annual report, 

 Remaining however deeply concerned over the lack of progress on the ground 

in some situations of concern, where parties to conflict continue to violate with 

impunity the relevant provisions of applicable international law relating to the rights 

and protection of children in armed conflict,  



S/2015/445 
 

 

15-10057 2/6 

 

 Recalling that all parties to armed conflict must comply strictly with the 

obligations applicable to them under international law for the protection of children 

in armed conflict, including those contained in the Convention on the Rights of the 

Child and its Optional Protocol on the involvement of Children in armed conflict, as 

well as the Geneva Conventions of 12th August 1949 and the Additional Protocols 

of 1977, 

 Convinced that the protection of children in armed conflict should be an 

important aspect of any comprehensive strategy to resolve conflict and build peace 

and stressing also the importance of adopting a broad strategy of conflict 

prevention, which addresses the root causes of armed conflict in a comprehensive 

manner in order to enhance the protection of children on a long -term basis, 

 Stressing the primary role of Governments in providing protection and relief to 

all children affected by armed conflict and recognizing the importance of 

strengthening national capacities in this regard,  

 Reiterating that all action undertaken by United Nations entities within the 

framework of the monitoring and reporting mechanism must be designed to support 

and supplement, as appropriate, the protection and rehabilitation roles of national 

Governments, 

 Recognizing also the important roles that local leaders and civil society 

networks can play in enhancing community-level protection and rehabilitation, 

including non-stigmatization, for children affected by armed conflict,  

 Recalling the responsibility of all Member States to comply with their 

respective obligations to end impunity and to investigate and prosecute those 

responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other egregious 

crimes perpetrated against children and noting that the fight against impunity for the 

most serious crimes of international concern committed against children has been 

strengthened through the work on and prosecution of these crimes by the 

International Criminal Court, ad hoc and mixed tribunals and specialized chambers 

in national tribunals, 

 Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 8 June 2015 

(S/2015/409) and stressing that the present resolution does not seek to make any 

legal determination as to whether situations which are referred to in the Secretary-

General’s report are or are not armed conflicts within the context of the Geneva 

Conventions and the Additional Protocols thereto, nor does it prejudge the legal 

status of the non-State parties involved in these situations,  

 Expressing grave concern over the abduction of children in situations of armed 

conflict, the majority of which are perpetrated by non -State armed groups, 

recognizing that abductions occur in a variety of settings, including schools, further 

recognizing that abduction often precedes or follows other abuses and violations of 

applicable international law against children, including those involving recruitment 

and use, killing and maiming, as well as rape and other forms of sexual violence, 

which may amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity, and calling on all 

Member States to hold perpetrators of abductions accountable,  

 Gravely concerned by the human rights abuses and violations of international 

humanitarian law committed by non-state armed groups, in particular violent 

extremist groups, including mass abductions, rape and other forms of sexual

violence such as sexual slavery, particularly targeting girls, which can cause 

displacement and affect access to education and healthcare services, and 

emphasizing the importance of accountability for such abuses and violations,  

 Noting that Article 35 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child ca lls for 

States Parties to take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to 

prevent the abduction of, the sale of or traffic in children for any purpose or in any 

form, 

 Gravely concerned by the detrimental effects of the illicit transfer, 

destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons on children 

in armed conflict, in particular due to recruitment and use of children by parties to 

armed conflict, as well as their re-recruitment, killing and maiming, rape and other 

sexual violence, abductions, attacks on schools and hospitals in violation of 

international law, 

 Stressing that the best interests of the child as well as the specific needs and 

vulnerabilities of children should be considered when planning and carrying out 

actions concerning children in situations of armed conflict,  

 Recalling the obligations of all parties to armed conflict applicable to them 

under international humanitarian law and human rights law, emphasizing that no 

child should be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily and calling on 

all Parties to conflict to cease unlawful or arbitrary detention as well as torture or 

other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment imposed on children 

during their detention, 

 Recognizing the importance of providing timely and appropriate reintegration 

and rehabilitation assistance to children affected by armed conflict, while ensuring 

that the specific needs of girls as well as children with disabilities are addressed, 

including access to health care, psychosocial support, and education programmes 

that contribute to the well-being of children and to sustainable peace and security,  

 Calling on all parties to conflict to respect the civilian character of schools as 

such in accordance with international humanitarian law, 

 1. Strongly condemns all violations of applicable international law 

involving the recruitment and use of children by parties to armed conflict as well as 

their rerecruitment, killing and maiming, rape and other forms of sexual violence, 

abductions, attacks against schools and hospitals as well as denial of humanitarian 

access by parties to armed conflict and all other violations of international law, 

including international humanitarian law, human rights law and refugee law, 

committed against children in situations of armed conflict and demands that all 

relevant parties immediately put an end to such practices and take specia l measures 

to protect children; 

 2. Reaffirms that the monitoring and reporting mechanism will continue to 

be implemented in situations listed in annex I and annex II (“the annexes”) to the 

reports of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict, in line with the 

principles set out in paragraph 2 of its resolution 1612 (2005), and that its 

establishment and implementation shall not prejudge or imply a decision by the 

Security Council as to whether or not to include a situation on its agenda; 

 3. Recalls paragraph 16 of its resolution 1379 (2001) and requests the 

Secretary-General also to include in the annexes to his reports on children and 



S/2015/445 
 

 

15-10057 4/6 

 

armed conflict those parties to armed conflict that engage, in contravention of 

applicable international law, in patterns of abduction of children in situations of 

armed conflict, bearing in mind all other violations and abuses against children, and 

notes that the present paragraph will apply to situations in accordance with the 

conditions set out in paragraph 16 of its resolution 1379 (2001);  

 4. Calls upon those parties listed in the annexes of the Secretary-General’s 

report on children and armed conflict that commit violations and abuses against 

children in contravention of applicable international law, including abductions of 

children in situations of armed conflict, to prepare and adopt without delay, concrete 

time-bound action plans to halt those violations and abuses in collaboration with the 

United Nations; 

 5. Urges for the immediate, safe and unconditional release of abducted 

children by all Parties to conflict and encourages Member States, United Nations 

entities, and regional and sub-regional organizations to undertake relevant efforts to 

obtain the safe release of abducted children, including through establishing standard 

operating procedures on the handover of children to relevant civilian child 

protection actors, as well as to seek to ensure their family reunification, 

rehabilitation and reintegration;  

 6. Encourages Member States to consider non-judicial measures as 

alternatives to prosecution and detention that focus on the rehabilitation and 

reintegration for children formerly associated with armed forces and armed groups 

taking into account that deprivation of liberty of children should be used only as a 

measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time, as well as to 

avoid wherever possible the use of pretrial detention for children;  

 7. Expresses deep concern that the military use of schools in contravention 

of applicable international law may render schools legitimate targets of attack, thus 

endangering the safety of children and in this regard encourages Member States to 

take concrete measures to deter such use of schools by armed forces and armed 

groups; 

 8. Stresses the importance of regular and timely consideration of violations 

and abuses committed against children in armed conflict, in this regard welcomes 

the sustained activity of its Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict and 

invites the Working Group to make full use of tools within its mandate to promote 

the protection of children affected by armed conflict, including through increasing 

engagement with concerned Member States, in light of ongoing discussions on 

enhancing compliance; 

 9. Continues to urge Member States, United Nations entities, regional and 

sub-regional organizations and other parties concerned to ensure that child 

protection provisions, including those relating to the release and reintegration of 

children formerly associated with armed forces or armed groups, are integrated into 

all peace negotiations, ceasefire and peace agreements, and in provisions for 

ceasefire monitoring; 

 10. Welcomes the progress made under the “Children, Not Soldiers” 

campaign towards ending and preventing the recruitment and use of children by 

Government armed forces in conflict by 2016, further urges concerned Governments 

to continue to undertake all efforts in order to ensure that no children are in their 



 
S/2015/445 

 

5/6 15-10057 

 

ranks in conflict, and calls on Member States, all relevant United Nations entities, 

NGOs and the donor community to support the campaign in their various capacities;  

 11. Invites the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children 

and Armed Conflict to update the Security Council on the campaign “Children, Not 

Soldiers” as well as on the progress made in the signing and implementation of 

action plans or commitments by non-State armed groups, including about the 

process and progress in delisting concerned parties;  

 12. Urges all parties concerned, including Member States, United Nations 

entities, as well as financial institutions to support, as appropriate, bearing in mind 

national ownership, the development and strengthening of the capacities of national 

institutions and local civil society networks for advocacy, protection and 

rehabilitation of children affected by armed conflict as well as national 

accountability mechanisms with timely, sustained and adequate resources and 

funding; 

 13. Urges concerned Member States, when undertaking security sector 

reforms, to mainstream child protection, such as the inclusion of child protection in 

military training and standard operating procedures, including on the handover of 

children to relevant civilian child protection actors, the establishment of child 

protection units in national security forces, and the strengthening of effective age 

assessment mechanisms to prevent underage recruitment, while stressing in the 

latter regard the importance of ensuring universal birth registration, including late 

birth registration which should remain an exception;  

 14. Emphasizes the responsibility of all States to put an end to impunity and 

to investigate and prosecute those responsible for genocide, crimes against 

humanity, war crimes and other egregious crimes perpetrated against children and 

highlights in this regard the contribution of the International Criminal Court, in 

accordance with the principle of complementarity to national criminal jurisdictions 

as set out in the Rome Statute; 

 15. Recognizes the role of United Nations peacekeeping operations and 

political missions in the protection of children, particularly the crucial role of child 

protection advisers in mainstreaming child protection and leading monitoring, 

prevention and reporting efforts in missions, and in this regard reiterates its decision 

to continue the inclusion of specific provisions for the protection of children in the 

mandates of all relevant United Nations peacekeeping operations and political 

missions, encourages deployment of child protection advisers to such missions, and

roles of such advisers are systematically assessed during the preparation and 

renewal of each United Nations peacekeeping operation and political mission;  

 16. Calls for the continued implementation by United Nations peacekeeping 

operations of the Secretary-General’s zero-tolerance policy on sexual exploitation 

and abuse and to ensure full compliance of their personnel with the United Nations 

code of conduct, reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to continue to take 

all necessary action in this regard and to keep the Security Council informed, and 

urges troop-contributing countries to continue taking appropriate preventive action, 

such as mandatory pre-deployment child protection training including on sexual 

exploitation and abuse, and to ensure full accountability in cases of such conduct 

involving their personnel; 



S/2015/445 
 

 

15-10057 6/6 

 

 17. Further urges all United Nations entities, including peacekeeping 

missions, political missions, peacebuilding offices, United Nations offices, 

agencies, funds and programmes to give full attention to violations against children 

in the application of the Human Rights Due Diligence Policy on United Na tions 

Support to non-United Nations Security Forces; 

 18. Reiterates its requests to the Secretary-General to continue to submit 

comprehensive annual reports to the Council on the implementation of its
