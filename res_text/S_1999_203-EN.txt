Reaffirming its commitment to preserve the sovereignty and territorial

the "Acordos de Paz", the Lusaka Protocol and relevant Security Council
resolutions,

Underscoring the contribution of the United Nations to the past four years

Taking note of the letter of the President of the Republic of Angola to the
Secretary-General of 11 February 1999 (S/1999/166),
