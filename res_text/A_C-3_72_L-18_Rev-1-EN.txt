 Welcoming the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,
9
 

which is inclusive of persons with disabilities and in which Member S tates pledged 

to leave no one behind, and acknowledging that Member States, while implementing 

the 2030 Agenda, should, inter alia, respect, protect and promote human rights and 

fundamental freedoms for all, without discrimination of any kind,  

 Welcoming also the inclusion of gender equality and the empowerment of all 

women and girls as a stand-alone goal and in the implementation of all goals and 

targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the recognition that 

realizing gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls is crucial to 

making progress across all the Sustainable Development Goals and targets which 

contribute to the empowerment of women and girls with disabilities,  

 Welcoming the fact that, since the opening for signature of the Convention and 

the Optional Protocol thereto on 30 March 2007, 160 States have signed and 

174 States and 1 regional integration organization have ratified or acceded to the 

Convention and 92 States have signed and 92 States have ratified the Optional 

Protocol, 

 Noting with appreciation the work and activities that have been and continue 

to be undertaken in support of the Convention and towards the fulfilment and 

mainstreaming of the rights of all persons with disabilities, particularly through,

unequal power relations that view women and girls, in particular women and girls 

with disabilities, as subordinate to men and boys, and underscoring that States

 Expressing concern further that stereotypes, stigmatization and discrimination 

heighten the risk of violence, exploitation and abuse, including sexual violence and 

abuse, against women and girls with disabilities compared to women and girls 

without disabilities, as well as men and boys with disabilities,  

 Expressing concern about the low labour force participation rate of women

 Recognizing the contribution of family members towards ensuring the full 

enjoyment by women and girls with disabilities of all human rights and fundamental

levels contributes to their exclusion in official statistics, policies and programmes, 

and in this regard recognizing the need to intensify efforts to build the capacity of

legislation, policies and programmes that are inclusive of all women and girls with 

disabilities, and affirming that realizing their human rights requires their full, 

effective and meaningful participation and inclusion in all aspects of public, 

political, economic, cultural, social and family life, on an equal basis with all 

others, 

 Recognizing also that information and communications technologies have 

shown their potential to strengthen the exercise of human rights, and that they can 

create conditions enabling women and girls with disabilities to fully enjoy their 

human rights and can also contribute to their empowerment,  

 Stressing the importance of closely consulting and actively involving persons 

with disabilities, in particular women and girls, through their representative 

organizations in the development and implementation of legislation and policies that 

impact their lives and in other decision-making processes concerning issues relating 

to persons with disabilities,

rights of women and girls with disabilities in order to eliminate stereotypes, 

prejudices and violence, including harmful practices which seriously violate and

that women and girls with disabilities are closely consulted and actively involved, 

through their representative organizations, in the design, implementation and 

monitoring of all legislation, policies and programmes which have an impact on 

their lives;  

 9. Encourages States to review and repeal any law or policy that restricts 

persons with disabilities, including women with disabilities, from their effective and 

full participation in political and public life on an equal basis with others, including

with disabilities;
