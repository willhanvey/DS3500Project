 The General Assembly, 

 Reaffirming that achieving a world without nuclear weapons is a common goal 

for the international community,  

 Reaffirming also that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons1 

is the cornerstone of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime and an 

essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation 

and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, which are mutually reinforcing, and 

reaffirming its determination to further enhance the universality of the Treaty, 

 Noting the postponement of the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the 

Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, scheduled from 27 April to 

22 May 2020, underscoring the importance of its successful outcome, recalling that 

the year 2020 marks the fiftieth anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty and 

75 years since the use of nuclear weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, stressing that 

since that time no nuclear weapons have been used, and emphasizing the necessity  

for all States parties to comply with all of their obligations regarding nuclear 

disarmament and non-proliferation under the Treaty, 

 Reaffirming the importance of the agreed steps contained in the Final 

Documents of the 19952 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty

on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and of the 2000 3  and 20104  Review 

Conferences of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, 

 Bearing in mind that various approaches exist towards the realization of a world 

without nuclear weapons and that confidence-building among all States is essential 

to this end, 

 Emphasizing the importance for all States of taking further practical steps and 

effective measures towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons, in a way that 

promotes international stability, peace and security, and based on the principle of 

undiminished and increased security for all,  

 Encouraging the establishment of further nuclear-weapon-free zones, where 

appropriate, on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among States of the region 

concerned, and in accordance with the 1999 guidelines of the Disarmament Commission, 5  

 Stressing the importance of the immediate commencement and early conclusion 

of negotiations on a treaty banning the production of fissile material for use in nuclear 

weapons or other nuclear explosive devices in the Conference on Disarmament, and 

supporting the commencement of such negotiations in accordance with document 

CD/1299 and the mandate contained therein, and voluntarily ceasing such production 

pending the entry into force of such a treaty,  

 Stressing also the importance of preventing further nuclear testing, such as 

through the signing and ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty6 

without delay by all States, in particular the eight remaining States in annex 2 thereto,  

 Recognizing the importance of reducing the risk of nuclear weapons being used 

either by miscalculation or by misunderstanding, 

 Recalling the indispensable role of effective and credible nuclear disarmament 

verification in assuring compliance, in the course of achieving and then maintaining 

the elimination of nuclear weapons, welcoming the substantive work of the Group of 

Governmental Experts to consider the role of verification in advancing nuclear 

disarmament, as contained in its report,7 and welcoming also the establishment of a 

new group of governmental experts pursuant to resolution 74/50 of 12 December 2019, 

 Recognizing the importance of the Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction 

and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (New START Treaty) , recognizing the 

ongoing dialogue among parties on the potential extension of that Treaty in a way that 

contributes to strategic stability, stressing specifically the importance of more 

transparency among nuclear-weapon States, and reaffirming their special 

responsibility to initiate arms control dialogues in good faith on effective measures 

to prevent nuclear arms racing and help to prepare the way for the eventual 

elimination of nuclear weapons,  

 Recognizing the value of cooperative work across the existing multilateral 

disarmament machinery to support work towards disarmament objectives,
