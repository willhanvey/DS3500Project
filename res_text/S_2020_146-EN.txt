draft resolution 
 

 

  The Security Council,

concerning Yemen, 

  Reaffirming its strong commitment to the unity, sovereignty, independence and 

territorial integrity of Yemen, 

  Expressing concern at the ongoing political, security, economic and 

humanitarian challenges in Yemen, including the ongoing violence and enforced 

disappearances, and threats arising from the illicit transfer, destabilising accumulation 

and misuse of weapons, 

  Emphasising the environmental risks and the need, without delay, for access of 

UN officials to inspect and maintain the Safer oil tanker, which is located in the 

Houthi-controlled North of Yemen,  

  Reiterating its call for all parties in Yemen to adhere to resolving their 

differences through dialogue and consultation, reject acts of violence to achieve 

political goals, and refrain from provocation, 

  Reaffirming the need for all parties to comply with their obligations under 

international law, including international humanitarian law and international human 

rights law as applicable, 

  Expressing its support for and commitment to the work of the Special Envoy for 

Yemen to the Secretary-General in support of the Yemeni transition process,  

  Expressing its alarm that areas of Yemen remain under the control of Al-Qaida 

in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and about the negative impact of their presence, 

violent extremist ideology and actions on stability in Yemen and the region, including 

the devastating humanitarian impact on the civilian populations, expressing concern 

at the increasing presence and future potential growth of the Islamic State in Iraq and 

Levant (ISIL, also known as Da’esh) affiliates in Yemen, and reaffirming its resolve 

to address all aspects of the threat posed by AQAP, ISIL (Da’esh), and all other 

associated individuals, groups, undertakings and entities,  

  Recalling the listing of AQAP and associated individuals on the ISIL (Da’esh)

  Noting the critical importance of effective implementation of the sanctions 

regime imposed pursuant to resolution 2140 (2014) and resolution 2216 (2015), 

including the key role that Member States from the region can play in this regard, and 

encouraging efforts to further enhance cooperation, 

  Welcoming the work of the Panel of Experts on Yemen, established pursuant to 

resolution 2140 (2014), 

  Recalling the provisions of paragraph 14 of resolution 2216 (2015) imposing a 

targeted arms embargo, and calling on all Member States and other actors to comply 

with the targeted arms embargo,  

  Condemning in the strongest terms violations of International Humanitarian 

Law and violations and abuses of International Human Rights Law, including those 

involving conflict-related sexual violence in Houthi-controlled areas and recruitment 

and use of children in armed conflict across Yemen, as recorded in the Panel of 

Experts’ final report (S/2020/70), 

  Expressing alarm over the obstacles that have been imposed on the work and 

access of the Panel of Experts during the course of its last mandate,  

  Expressing serious concern at the devastating humanitarian situation in Yemen 

and all instances of undue hindrances to the effective delivery of humanitarian 

assistance, including the recent interference in aid operations in Houthi-controlled 

areas as well as obstacles and the undue limitations on the delivery of vital goods to 

the civilian population occurring throughout Yemen, which is preventing vulnerable 

people from receiving the assistance they need to survive,  

  Emphasising the necessity of discussion by the Committee established pursuant 

to paragraph 19 of resolution 2140 (2014) (“the Committee”) of the recommendations 

contained in the Panel of Experts reports, 

  Determining that the situation in Yemen continues to constitute a threat to

the sanctions measures imposed by the Security Council in resolutions 2140 (2014) 

and 2216 (2015) if the Committee determines that such an exemption is necessary to 

facilitate the work of the United Nations and other humanitarian organisations in 

Yemen or for any other purpose consistent with the objectives of these resolutions;  

 

  Designation Criteria
