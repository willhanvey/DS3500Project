Reaffirming its commitment to the sovereignty, unity, independence and
territorial integrity of Sudan, and recalling the importance of the principles of good
neighbourliness, non-interference and regional cooperation,

Recalling the commitments made by the parties in the 8 April N’djamena
Ceasefire Agreement and the 9 November 2004 Abuja Humanitarian and Security
Protocols between the Government of Sudan, the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army
(SLM/A) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), and recalling the
commitments made in the Joint Communique of 3 July 2004 between the
Government of Sudan and the Secretary-General,

Welcoming the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the
Government of Sudan (GOS) and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army

Recognizing that the parties to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement must
build on the Agreement to bring peace and stability to the entire country, and calling
on all Sudanese parties, in particular those party to the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement, to take immediate steps to achieve a peaceful settlement to the conflict
in Darfur and to take all necessary action to prevent further violations of human
rights and international humanitarian law and to put an end to impunity, including in
the Darfur region,

Expressing its utmost concern over the dire consequences of the prolonged
conflict for the civilian population in the Darfur region as well as throughout Sudan,

Condemning the continued violations of the N’djamena Ceasefire Agreement
of 8 April 2004 and the Abuja Protocols of 9 November 2004 by all sides in Darfur
and the deterioration of the security situation and negative impact this has had on
humanitarian assistance efforts,

Strongly condemning all violations of human rights and international
humanitarian law in the Darfur region, in particular the continuation of violence
against civilians and sexual violence against women and girls since the adoption of
resolution 1574 (2004), urging all parties to take necessary steps to prevent further
violations, and expressing its determination to ensure that those responsible for all
such violations are identified and brought to justice without delay,

Recognizing that international support for implementation of the
Comprehensive Peace Agreement is critically important to its success, emphasizing
that progress towards resolution of the conflict in Darfur would create conditions
conducive for delivery of such assistance, and alarmed that the violence in Darfur
nonetheless continues,

Recalling the demands, in resolutions 1556 (2004), 1564 (2004), and
1574 (2004), that all parties to the conflict in Darfur refrain from any violence
against civilians and cooperate fully with the African Union Mission in Darfur,

Welcoming the 16 February 2005 N’djamena Summit on Darfur and the
continued commitment of the African Union to play a key role in facilitating a
resolution to the conflict in Darfur in all respects, and the announcement by the
Government of Sudan on 16 February 2005 that it would take immediate steps,
including withdrawal of its forces from Labado, Qarifa, and Marla in Darfur, and the
withdrawal of its Antonov aircraft from Darfur,

Commending the efforts of the African Union, in particular its Chairman,
acknowledging the progress made by the African Union in the deployment of an
international protection force, police, and military observers, and calling on all
member states to contribute generously and urgently to the African Union Mission
in Darfur,

Reaffirming its resolutions 1325 (2000) on women, peace, and security,
1379 (2001) and 1460 (2003) on children in armed conflicts, as well as resolutions
1265 (1999) and 1296 (2000) on the protection of civilians in armed conflicts and
resolution 1502 (2003) on the protection of humanitarian and UN personnel,

Taking note of the Secretary-General’s reports of 31 January 2005 (S/2005/57
and Add.1), 3 December 2004 (S/2004/947), 4 February 2005 (S/2005/68), and
4 March 2005 (S/2005/140), as well as the report of 25 January 2005 of the

international peace and security,

Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,

1. Deplores strongly that the Government of Sudan and rebel forces and all
other armed groups in Darfur have failed to comply fully with their commitments

and 1574 (2004), condemns the continued violations of the 8 April 2004 N’djamena

strikes by the Government of Sudan in December 2004 and January 2005 and rebel

Janajaweed leaders and their associates who have carried out human rights and
international humanitarian law violations and other atrocities, and demands that all

Ceasefire Agreement and the Abuja Protocols, including notification of force
positions, to facilitate humanitarian assistance, and to cooperate fully with the
African Union Mission;

2. Emphasizes that there can be no military solution to the conflict in
Darfur, and calls upon the Government of Sudan and the rebel groups, particularly
the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudanese Liberation Movement/Army to

speedily reach agreement, and urges the parties to the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement to play an active and constructive role in support of the Abuja talks and
