Fifty-seventh session
First Committee
Agenda item 66 (n)
General and complete disarmament: conventional
arms control at the regional and subregional levels

Bangladesh, Belarus, Germany, Italy, Nepal, Pakistan, Peru and Ukraine:
draft resolution

Conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolutions 48/75 J of 16 December 1993, 49/75 O of 15
December 1994, 50/70 L of 12 December 1995, 51/45 Q of 10 December 1996,
52/38 Q of 9 December 1997, 53/77 P of 4 December 1998, 54/54 M of 1 December
1999, 55/33 P of 20 November 2000 and 56/24 I of 29 November 2001,

Recognizing the crucial role of conventional arms control in promoting
regional and international peace and security,

Convinced that conventional arms control needs to be pursued primarily in the
regional and subregional contexts since most threats to peace and security in the
post-cold-war era arise mainly among States located in the same region or
subregion,

Aware that the preservation of a balance in the defence capabilities of States at
the lowest level of armaments would contribute to peace and stability and should be
a prime objective of conventional arms control,

Desirous of promoting agreements to strengthen regional peace and security at
the lowest possible level of armaments and military forces,

Noting with particular interest the initiatives taken in this regard in different
regions of the world, in particular the commencement of consultations among a
number of Latin American countries and the proposals for conventional arms control
made in the context of South Asia, and recognizing, in the context of this subject,
the relevance and value of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe,1
which is a cornerstone of European security,

Believing that militarily significant States and States with larger military
capabilities have a special responsibility in promoting such agreements for regional
security,

Believing also that an important objective of conventional arms control in
regions of tension should be to prevent the possibility of military attack launched by
surprise and to avoid aggression,

1. Decides to give urgent consideration to the issues involved in
conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels;

2. Requests the Conference on Disarmament to consider the formulation of
principles that can serve as a framework for regional agreements on conventional
arms control, and looks forward to a report of the Conference on this subject;

3. Also requests the Secretary-General to seek, in the meanwhile, views of
Member States on the subject and submit a report to the General Assembly at its
fifty-eighth session;

4. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-eighth session the
item entitled “Conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels”.
