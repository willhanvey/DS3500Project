 Recalling further its resolutions 71/205 of 19 December 2016, 72/190 of

75/192 of 16 December 2020 on the situation of human rights in the Autonomous 

Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine,  

 Gravely concerned that the provisions of those resolutions and relevant 

decisions of international organizations, specialized agencies and bodies within the 

United Nations system have not been implemented by the Russian Federation,  

 Recalling its resolution 3314 (XXIX) of 14 December 1974, in the annex to 

which it was stated, inter alia, that no territorial acquisition or special advantage 

resulting from aggression is or shall be recognized as lawful,

Ukraine, namely, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol 

(hereinafter referred to as “Crimea”), by the Russian Federation, and reaffirming the 

non-recognition of its annexation, 

 Recalling that the temporary occupation of Crimea and the threat or use of force 

against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine by the Russian 

Federation is in contravention of commitments made in the Memorandum on Security 

Assurances in Connection with Ukraine’s Accession to the Treaty on the 

Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (Budapest Memorandum) of 5 December 

1994,1 in which, inter alia, the obligations to refrain from the threat or use of force 

against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine and the 

commitment to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of 

Ukraine were reaffirmed, 

 Deeply concerned by the illegal seizure and establishment of control by the 

Russian Federation over the former nuclear weapons storage sites in Crimea, which 

may pose a threat to regional and global security,  

 Expressing concern over the efforts of the Russian Federation to extend its 

jurisdiction over the nuclear facilities and material in Crimea, in respect of which the 

Agreement between Ukraine and the International Atomic Energy Agency for the 

Application of Safeguards in connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 

Nuclear Weapons and the Additional Protocol thereto continue to apply, 

 Expressing concern also about the ongoing deterioration of the international 

security and arms control architecture, including as a result of the temporary 

occupation by the Russian Federation of the territories of the Autonomous Republic 

of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, which has had a destabilizing impact on the 

international arms control regimes and confidence- and security-building measures, 

including those established by the Treaty on Open Skies, the Treaty on Conventional 

Armed Forces in Europe 2  and the Vienna Document 2011 on Confidence- and 

Security-Building Measures, and rejecting the attempts by the Russian Federation to 

advance its narrative about its actions in the temporarily occupied Crimea through the 

implementation of international arms control regimes,  

 Affirming that the seizure of Crimea by force is illegal and a violation of 

international law, and affirming also that those territories must be immediately 

returned, 

 Recalling the prohibition, under international humanitarian law, for the 

occupying Power to compel protected persons to serve in its armed or auxiliary forces, 

including through pressure or propaganda that is aimed at securing voluntary

enlistment, and condemning the ongoing recruitment and conscription campaigns in 

Crimea and criminal prosecutions, which include fines, correctional labour and 

imprisonment of Crimean residents for draft evasion,  

 Concerned by efforts to use the education of children in Crimea in order to 

indoctrinate them to join the Russian military forces, 

 Recalling the order of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea of 

25  May 2019 on provisional measures in the Case concerning the detention of three 

Ukrainian naval vessels (Ukraine v. Russian Federation)  and Procedural Order No. 1 

of the Arbitral Tribunal Constituted under Annex VII to the 1982 United Nations 

Convention on the Law of the Sea between Ukraine and the Russian Federation in 

respect of a Dispute concerning the Detention of Ukrainian Naval Vessels and 

Servicemen of 22 November 2019, 

 Noting the fact that security concerns, the unprovoked build-up of forces in and 

around Ukraine and the holding of Russian military exercises in the Black Sea and 

the Sea of Azov regions, accompanied by closures and restrictions of the lawful 

exercise of navigational rights and freedoms, further destabilize the economy and 

social services, particularly in the coastal regions of Ukraine,  

 Supporting the commitment by Ukraine to adhere to international law in its 

efforts to put an end to the temporary Russian occupation of Crimea, 

 Noting the establishment of the International Crimea Platform and the adoption 

of the Joint Declaration of the International Crimea Platform Participants, 3  

 1. Urges the Russian Federation, as the occupying Power, immediately, 

completely and unconditionally to withdraw its military forces from Crimea and end 

its temporary occupation of the territory of Ukraine without delay;  

 2. Calls upon all Member States and relevant international organizations to 

cooperate with the United Nations to encourage and support efforts to put an end to 

the Russian occupation of Crimea as rapidly as possible and to refrain from any action 

or dealing with the Russian Federation regarding Crimea that is inconsistent with this 

aim; 

 3. Supports commitments and concerted efforts by the international 

community, including within international frameworks and the International Crimea 

Platform, to address existing and emerging challenges resulting from the progressive 

militarization of Crimea and parts of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, which 

undermines security and stability in the region and beyond, and supports the peaceful 

de-occupation of Crimea; 

 4. Stresses that the presence of Russian troops in Crimea is contrary to the 

national sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine and 

undermines the security and stability of neighbouring countries and the European 

region; 

 5. Reiterates its grave concern over the progressive militarization of Crimea 

by the Russian Federation, as the occupying Power, namely the continuing 

destabilization of Crimea owing to transfers by the Russian Federation of 

conventional weapons, including advanced weapon systems, battle tanks, armoured 

combat vehicles, nuclear-capable aircraft, helicopters and missiles, as well as small 

arms and light weapons, ammunition and military personnel, to the territory of 

Ukraine, and urges the Russian Federation to stop such activity without delay;

 6. Calls upon the Russian Federation to engage constructively with 

confidence- and security-building and risk reduction mechanisms to build 

transparency over its regular military activity in Crimea, which undermines stability, 

military predictability and trust in the broader region;  

 7. Condemns the use of seized Ukrainian military industry enterprises in the 

occupied Crimea by the Russian Federation, including for further development and 

build-up of forces; 

 8. Calls upon the Russian Federation to refrain from efforts to extend its 

jurisdiction over the nuclear facilities and material in Crimea; 

 9. Expresses its deep concern over the continued conscription by the Russian 

Federation of the residents of Crimea, including those holding Ukrainian citizenship, 

into its armed forces, including assignment to military bases in the  Russian 

Federation, and urges the Russian Federation to stop such activity, which contradicts 

international humanitarian law, without delay;  

 10. Calls upon the Russian Federation to refrain from establishing educational 

institutions that provide combat training to Crimean children with the stated aim of 

training for military service in the Russian armed forces, to refrain from establishing 

combat training courses at Crimean schools and to cease efforts to formally 

incorporate Crimean educational institutions into the “military-patriotic” education 

system of the Russian Federation; 

 11. Reiterates its concern regarding multiple military exercises of Russian 

armed forces held in Crimea and parts of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, which 

undermine regional security and entail considerable long-term negative environmental 

consequences in the region; 

 12. Calls upon the Russian Federation to refrain from unlawful activities in 

Crimea and parts of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, including but not limited to 

interfering and blocking navigation both for commercial vessels going to and from 

ports of Ukraine and for government ships sailing under various flags, which further 

exacerbate tensions in the region and beyond;  

 13. Condemns the construction by the Russian Federation of navy vessels at 

the seized shipyards in the temporarily occupied Crimea, which further contributes to 

the build-up of forces and poses a threat to regional security and stability;  

 14. Expresses its concern over the extension of naval bases for the Black Sea 

fleet of the Russian Federation in Crimea;  

 15. Also expresses its concern about the adoption by the Russian Federation 

of legislation that grants its National Guard the right to block areas adjacent to certain 

infrastructure facilities in Crimea and parts of the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov and the 

Kerch Strait, and which therefore may be used to interfere with navigational rights in 

violation of international law; 

 16. Further expresses its concern over the deployment by the Russian 

Federation of military and security forces for the protection of the offshore oil 

platforms located in the Black Sea, which are the property of Ukraine and which  have 

been seized by the Russian Federation, thus excluding Ukraine from its maritime 

areas, the exploitation by the Russian Federation of the underlying natural resources 

in those areas and its usurpation of the jurisdiction of Ukraine there;  

 17. Expresses its utmost concern about the dangerous increase in tensions and 

the unjustified use of force by the Russian Federation against Ukraine, in the Black 

Sea, the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait, including the intentional obstruction of 

traffic; 



 
A/76/L.22 

 

5/5 21-17815 

 

 18. Calls upon the Russian Federation to return to Ukraine unconditionally 

and without delay all equipment and weapons seized from the vessels Berdyansk, 

Nikopol and the tugboat Yani Kapu during the unjustified use of force by the Russian 

Federation on 25 November 2018; 

 19. Encourages further negotiations to ensure the release by the Russian 

Federation of all illegally detained Ukrainian citizens and their safe return to Ukraine;  

 20. Calls upon the Russian Federation to refrain from impeding the lawful 

exercise of navigational rights and freedoms, exercised in accordance with applicable 

international law, including provisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the 

Law of the Sea,4 including but not limited to closure of sea areas under the pretext of 

military exercises, in the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait;  

 21. Condemns the construction and opening by the Russian Federation of the 

Kerch Strait bridge and the railway bridge, which form a part of the Tavrida highway 

project, between the Russian Federation and the temporarily occupied Crimea, which 

facilitates the further militarization of Crimea and restricts the size of vessels that can 

reach the Ukrainian ports on the Azov coast;  

 22. Also condemns the increasing military presence of the Russian Federation 

in parts of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, including the Kerch Strait, and the 

harassment by the Russian Federation of commercial vessels and its restriction of 

international shipping there, which further aggravates the economic and social 

situation in the broader Donetsk region already affected by the temporary occupation 

of Crimea and subsequent ongoing destabilizing acts by the Russian Federation;  

 23. Further condemns visits of Russian officials to the temporarily occupied 

Crimea, including those in connection with conducting military exercises, military 

parades and other activities; 

 24. Calls upon all Member States, as well as international organizations and 

specialized agencies, to refrain from any visits to Crimea that are not agreed with 

Ukraine; 

 25. Decides to continue its consideration of the matter at its seventy-seventh 

session.
