 Noting that, since the beginning of the vaccine roll-out, the majority of all 

vaccines administered have been concentrated in high-income countries, while low-

income countries still lag behind in gaining access to COVID-19 vaccines,  

 Expressing its serious concern over the disparity between developing countries 

and developed countries in terms of the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, which 

prevents the entire international community from achieving the complete elimination 

of COVID-19 as soon as possible and also further hampers progress in the realization 

of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,  

 Recognizing the need to tackle health inequities and inequalities within and 

among countries through political commitment, international cooperation and 

policies, including those that address the social, economic and environmental 

determinants of health,  

 Welcoming the global initiatives promoting global solidarity in response to the 

pandemic, including the efforts of countries that have supplied COVID-19 vaccines, 

and recalling the thirty-first special session of the General Assembly, in response to 

the COVID-19 pandemic, held on 3 and 4 December 2020, and the high-level meeting 

of the Assembly on universal health coverage, held on 23 September 2019,  

 Recognizing that the encouragement and development of international 

partnerships and cooperation in the scientific and cultural fields contribute to the 

realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard 

of physical and mental health, bearing in mind that everyone has the right to enjoy 

the benefits of scientific progress and its applications,  

 Recognizing also the importance of international cooperation and effective 

multilateralism in ensuring that all States, in particular developing States, including 

the least developed countries, have affordable, timely, equitable and universal access 

to COVID-19 vaccines in order to minimize negative effects in all affected States and 

to avoid the resurgence of the pandemic,  

 Recognizing further the important role that civil society, including 

non-governmental organizations and women’s and community-based organizations, 

youth-led organizations and all other stakeholders such as volunteers and national 

human rights institutions where they exist, as well as the academic and scientific

 Taking note of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 

Rights on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the enjoyment of human rights 

around the world, including good practices and areas of concern, 15  

 Reaffirming the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 

standard of physical and mental health, which requires that States take the steps 

necessary to prevent, treat and control epidemic, endemic, occupational and other 

diseases and to create the conditions that would assure medical services and medical 

attention for all in the event of sickness,  

 Deeply concerned about the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 

enjoyment of human rights around the world, and emphasizing the importance of 

human rights in shaping the response to the pandemic, in terms of both the public 

health emergency and the broader impact on people’s lives and livelihoods,  

 Underscoring that equitable access to health products is a matter of global 

priority and that the availability, accessibility, acceptability and affordability of health 

products of assured quality are fundamental to tackling the pandemic, and expressing 

its concern about the fact that the unequal distribution of vaccines delays the end of 

the pandemic,  

 Reaffirming the fundamental role of the United Nations system in coordinating 

the global response to control and contain the spread of COVID-19 and in providing 

support to States, and in this regard acknowledging the crucial leading role played by 

the World Health Organization, in line with its constitutional mandate,  

 Emphasizing the central role of the State in responding to pandemics and other 

health emergencies, and the socioeconomic consequences thereof, and in advancing 

sustainable development and the realization of human rights,  

 Recognizing the primary responsibility of States to adopt and implement 

responses to the COVID-19 pandemic that are specific to their national context, and 

that emergency measures taken by Governments in response to the COVID-19 

pandemic must be necessary, proportionate to the evaluated risk, applied in a 

non-discriminatory way, have a specific focus and duration and be in accordance with 

States’ obligations under applicable international human rights law,  

 Recognizing also that the COVID-19 pandemic has a disproportionately heavy 

impact on women, older persons, youth and children, as well as the poor, people in 

vulnerable situations and migrants,  

 Deeply concerned about the disproportionate and negative impact of the 

COVID-19 pandemic on the enjoyment of human rights by women and girls and on 

gender equality worldwide, including due to the increased incidence of domestic 

violence and interrupted access to sexual and reproductive health, and underscoring 

the need to ensure a gender-sensitive and people-centred recovery with full respect 

for human rights, mindful in particular of the need to ensure the full enjoyment by 

women and girls of their human rights,  

 Recognizing that persons with disabilities face a greater risk of COVID-19 

infection and have higher mortality rates, and face aggravated barriers to accessing 

COVID-19 information, as well as to timely and quality health-care services,  

 Deeply concerned that the COVID-19 pandemic perpetuates and exacerbates 

existing inequalities and that those most at risk are people in vulnerable situations, 

including older persons, migrants, refugees, internally displaced persons, persons 

with disabilities, people living with HIV/AIDS, persons belonging to national or 

ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, local communities, indigenous peoples,

 Noting the oral update provided by the United Nations High Commissioner for 

Human Rights to the Human Rights Council, at its forty-eighth session, on the human 

rights implications of the lack of affordable, timely, equitable and universal access to 

and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and the deepening inequalities between 

States, including the related vulnerabilities and challenges and the impact on the right 

of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 

health,  

 Noting also the Strategy to Achieve Global COVID-19 Vaccination by mid-2022 

of the World Health Organization, which outlines the urgent actions required by the 

global community to vaccinate 40 per cent of the population of all countries against 

COVID-19 by the end of 2021 and 70 per cent by mid-2022, anchored in the principles 

of equity, quality, integration and inclusivity,
