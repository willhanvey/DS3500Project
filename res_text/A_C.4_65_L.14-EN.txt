Convention1 and relevant provisions of customary law, including those codified in 
Additional Protocol I2 to the four Geneva Conventions,3 

 Recalling the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International 
Court of Justice on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory,4 and recalling also General Assembly resolutions 
ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004 and ES-10/17 of 15 December 2006,  

 Noting that the International Court of Justice concluded that “the Israeli 
settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have 
been established in breach of international law”,5  

 Taking note of the recent report of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights 
Council on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by 
Israel since 1967,6  

 Recalling the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government 
Arrangements of 13 September 19937 and the subsequent implementation 
agreements between the Palestinian and Israeli sides,  

 Recalling also the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State solution to the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict,8 and emphasizing specifically its call for a freeze on all

its obligations and commitments in this regard, 

 Aware that Israeli settlement activities involve, inter alia, the transfer of

land, the exploitation of natural resources and other actions against the Palestinian 
civilian population and the civilian population in the occupied Syrian Golan that are 
contrary to international law,

policies, decisions and activities on the efforts to resume and advance the peace 
process, on the credibility of the peace process, and on the prospects for the 
achievement of peace in the Middle East,  

 Expressing grave concern about the continuation by Israel, the occupying 
Power, of settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 
Jerusalem, in violation of international humanitarian law, relevant United Nations 
resolutions, the agreements reached between the parties and obligations under the 
Quartet road map, and in defiance of the calls by the international community to 
cease all settlement activities,

 Expressing grave concern in particular about Israel’s construction and 
expansion of settlements in and around occupied East Jerusalem, including its 
so-called E-1 plan that aims to connect its illegal settlements around and further 
isolate occupied East Jerusalem, the continuing demolition of Palestinian homes and 
eviction of Palestinian families from the city, the revocation of Palestinian residency 
rights in the city, and ongoing settlement activities in the Jordan Valley,  

 Expressing grave concern also about the continuing unlawful construction by 
Israel of the wall inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around 
East Jerusalem, and expressing its concern in particular about the route of the wall 
in departure from the Armistice Line of 1949, which is causing humanitarian 
hardship and a serious decline of socio-economic conditions for the Palestinian 
people, is fragmenting the territorial contiguity of the Territory and undermining its 
viability, and could prejudge future negotiations and make the two-State solution 
physically impossible to implement,  

 Deeply concerned that the wall’s route has been traced in such a way as to 
include the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem,  

 Deploring settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan and any activities involving the 
confiscation of land, the disruption of the livelihood of protected persons and the de 
facto annexation of land,  

 Recalling the need to end all acts of violence, including acts of terror, 
provocation, incitement and destruction,  

 Gravely concerned about the rising incidents of violence, harassment, 
provocation and incitement by illegal armed Israeli settlers in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, against Palestinian civilians, 
including children, and their properties, including historic and religious sites, and 
agricultural lands,  

 Noting the Israeli withdrawal from within the Gaza Strip and parts of the 
northern West Bank and the importance of the dismantlement of the settlements 
therein as a step towards the implementation of the road map, and stressing in this 
regard the road map obligation upon Israel to freeze settlement activity, including 
so-called “natural growth”, and to dismantle all settlement outposts erected since 
March 2001, 

 Taking note of the relevant reports of the Secretary-General,9 

 Taking note also of the special meeting of the Security Council convened on 
26 September 2008,  

 1. Reaffirms that the Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territory, 
including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan are illegal and an 
obstacle to peace and economic and social development;  

 2. Calls upon Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the Geneva 
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 
12 August 1949,1 to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem,

and to the occupied Syrian Golan and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the 
Convention, in particular article 49;  

 3. Also calls upon Israel, the occupying Power, to comply strictly with its 
obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law, with 
respect to the alteration of the character, status and demographic composition of the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem;  

 4. Reiterates its demand for the immediate and complete cessation of all 
Israeli settlement activities in all of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan, and calls in this regard for the 
full implementation of all the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, 
including, inter alia, resolutions 446 (1979), 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979, 465 
(1980), 476 (1980), and 1515 (2003) of 19 November 2003; 

 5. Demands that Israel, the occupying Power, comply with its legal 
obligations, as mentioned in the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the 
International Court of Justice;4  

 6. Reiterates its call for the prevention of all acts of violence and 
harassment by Israeli settlers, especially against Palestinian civilians and their 
properties, including historic and religious sites, and agricultural lands, and stresses 
the need for the implementation of Security Council resolution 904 (1994), in which 
the Council called upon Israel, the occupying Power, to continue to take and 
implement measures, including confiscation of arms, aimed at preventing illegal 
acts of violence by Israeli settlers, and called for measures to be taken to guarantee 
the safety and protection of the Palestinian civilians in the occupied territory;  

 7. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its 
sixty-sixth session on the implementation of the present resolution.
