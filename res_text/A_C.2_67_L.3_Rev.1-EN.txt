  Towards a New International Economic Order 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Bearing in mind the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United 
Nations to promote the economic advancement and social progress of all peoples, 

 Recalling the principles of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New 
International Economic Order and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of 
a New International Economic Order, as set out in resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 
(S-VI), respectively, adopted by the General Assembly at its sixth special session, 
on 1 May 1974, 

 Recalling also its resolutions 63/224 of 19 December 2008, 64/209 of

 Reaffirming the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1  

 Recalling the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the

 Recalling also the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on 
Sustainable Development, entitled “The future we want”,3 

 Recalling further the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and 
summits in the economic, social and related fields, including the development goals 
and objectives contained therein, and recognizing the vital role played by those 
conferences and summits in shaping a broad development vision and in identifying 
commonly agreed objectives,

 Stressing the need to fulfil all financing for development commitments, 
including those contained in the Monterrey Consensus of the International 
Conference on Financing for Development,4 the Doha Declaration on Financing for 
Development: outcome document of the Follow-up International Conference on 
Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey 
Consensus5 and other relevant outcomes of major United Nations conferences and 
summits,  

 Noting that there have been systemic challenges to the global economic 
architecture demanding a review of global economic governance, 

 Concerned about the multiple interrelated and mutually exacerbating current 
global crises, in particular the world financial and economic crisis, volatile energy 
prices, the food crisis and the challenges posed by climate change, which have a 
negative impact on the development prospects of developing countries, threaten to 
further widen the gap between developed and developing countries, including the 
technological and income gap, and could further undermine the achievement of the 
internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development 
Goals, 

 Concerned also in this regard that, in spite of some progress achieved in 
particular regions, some 200 million people globally are still unemployed and a 
further 900 million workers live with their families below the two-dollar-a-day 
poverty line,  

 Underlining the need for a more sustainable economic growth and recovery, 
and recognizing that this goal can be achieved through inclusive multilateralism and 
the equal participation of all countries, as envisioned, inter alia, in the Declaration 
and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International 
Economic Order, 

 Recognizing that innovative and enhanced approaches to financing for 
development are needed to address the challenges posed by the current global 
economic situation, poverty and the achievement of the internationally agreed 
development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, and stressing that 
these approaches should neither be a substitute for nor negatively affect the level of 
traditional sources of development financing, including official development 
assistance, and that they need to be developed in a spirit of partnership, cooperation 
and solidarity, bearing in mind the common interests and national priorities of each 
country, 

 Recognizing also that many relevant aspects of the Programme of Action on 
the Establishment of a New International Economic Order have not been 
implemented and that, consequently, many developing countries continue to face 
significant challenges to their development prospects, including vulnerability to 
external shocks and lack of adequate representation in global economic governance, 

 Recognizing further the role played by regional, subregional and interregional 
cooperation as well as regional economic integration, based on equality of

partnership, in strengthening international cooperation with the objective of 
facilitating economic coordination and cooperation for development, the 
achievement of development goals and the sharing of best practices and knowledge, 

 Recognizing that widespread financial deregulation has contributed to larger 
net capital outflows from developing countries to developed countries, 

 Concerned that excessively expansionary monetary policies and the ensuing 
competitive currency devaluations pursued by developed countries have an effect 
equivalent to across-the-board export subsidy and a generalized increase in import 
tariffs, which thus nullify or impair existing World Trade Organization market 
access commitments and further hinder the capacity of developing countries to fulfil 
their commitments to implement all the internationally agreed development goals, 
including the Millennium Development Goals, 

 Stressing the need for policy space to allow the formulation of national 
development strategies by developing countries, aimed at bringing prosperity for all, 

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General entitled “International 
challenges for sustainable development: global policy coherence and the role of the 
United Nations”;6 

 2. Reaffirms the need to continue working towards a new international 
economic order based on the principles of equity, sovereign equality, 
interdependence, common interest, cooperation and solidarity among all States; 

 3. Also reaffirms the need to enhance the voice and participation of 
developing countries in international economic decision-making and norm-setting; 

 4. Further reaffirms that international trade is an engine for development 
and sustained economic growth, and reaffirms the critical role that a universal, 
rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system can 
play in stimulating economic growth and development worldwide, thereby 
benefiting all countries at all stages of development; 

 5. Decides to continue considering the international economic situation and 
its impact on development at its sixty-ninth session, and in that regard requests the 
Secretary-General to include in his report to the General Assembly, under the item 
entitled “Globalization and interdependence”, an updated overview of the major 
international economic and policy challenges for equitable and inclusive sustained 
economic growth and sustainable development and of the role of the United Nations 
in addressing these issues, as well as possible ways and means to overcome those 
challenges, bearing in mind the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences 
and summits in the economic, social and related fields and the principles contained 
therein, and the preparations for the United Nations development agenda beyond 
2015, in the light of the relevant principles contained in the Declaration on the 
Establishment of a New International Economic Order7 and the Programme of 
Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.8
