 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of chemical weapons, in 

particular resolution 68/45 of 5 December 2013, adopted without a vote,  

 Determined to achieve the effective prohibition of the development, 

production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and their 

destruction, 

 Welcoming the significant progress achieved in the elimination of the Syrian 

chemical weapons programme, and noting in particular the completed elimination

material and equipment from the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic, despite 

uniquely challenging conditions, 

 Noting that the following actions remain to be taken:  

 (a) Destruction of chemical weapons material removed from the territory of 

the Syrian Arab Republic, outside its territory, 

 (b) Destruction of the 12 remaining declared chemical weapons production 

facilities, 

 (c) Inspections of the declared sites that remain to be inspected,  

 Urging the Technical Secretariat of the Organization for the Prohibition of

Arab Republic, with a view to the soonest resolution of questions raised by the 

Technical Secretariat to further the accuracy and completeness of the declaration, 

 Commending the invaluable contribution of the Joint Mission of the 

Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the United Nations and 

the personnel of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to the 

progress achieved in the elimination of the Syrian chemical weapons programme, as 

well as the assistance and support extended to this endeavour by the States parties, 

and welcoming the effective coordination between the Government of the Syrian 

Arab Republic and the Joint Mission and the personnel  of the Organization for the 

Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, 

 Reaffirming the broad support for the decision of the Director-General of the 

Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to send a mission to establish 

the facts surrounding the allegations of the use of toxic chemicals, reportedly 

chlorine, for hostile purposes in the Syrian Arab Republic, and re-emphasizing its 

unequivocal support for the decision of the Director-General to continue the 

mission, while stressing that the safety and security of mission personnel remains 

the top priority, 

 Underlining the fact that the use of chemical weapons by anyone under any 

circumstances would be reprehensible and completely contrary to the legal norms 

and standards of the international community, 

 Reaffirming the importance of the outcome of the Third Special Session of the 

Conference of the States Parties to Review the Operation of the Chemical Weapons 

Convention, held in The Hague from 8 to 19 April 2013 (the Third Review 

Conference), including its consensus final report, in which the Conference 

addressed all aspects of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, 

Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction,1 

and made important recommendations on its continued implementation,  

 Emphasizing that the Third Review Conference welcomed the fact that the 

Convention is a unique multilateral agreement banning an entire category of 

weapons of mass destruction in a non-discriminatory and verifiable manner under 

strict and effective international control and noted with satisfaction that the 

Convention continues to be a remarkable success and an example of effective 

multilateralism, 

 Convinced that the Convention, 17 years after its entry into force, has 

reinforced its role as the international norm against chemical weapons, and that it 

constitutes a major contribution to: 

 (a) International peace and security, 

 (b) Eliminating chemical weapons and preventing their re-emergence, 

 (c) The ultimate objective of general and complete disarmament under strict 

and effective international control, 

 (d) Excluding completely, for the sake of all mankind, the possibility of the 

use of chemical weapons,

possess or acquire such weapons, and calls upon all States that have not yet done so 

to become parties to the Convention without delay;  

 2. Underlines the fact that the full, effective and non-discriminatory 

implementation of all articles of the Convention makes a major contribut ion to 

international peace and security through the elimination of existing stockpiles of 

chemical weapons and the prohibition of their acquisition and use, and provides for

and for international cooperation for peaceful purposes in the field of chemical 

activities;

and under the verification of the Technical Secretariat of the Organization for the 

Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is essential for the realization of the object and 

purpose of the Convention;

fully meet the final extended deadline of 29 April 2012 for the destruction of their 

chemical weapons stockpiles, and also expressed determination that the destruction 

of all categories of chemical weapons should be completed in the shortest time 

possible in accordance with the provisions of the Convention and the Verification 

Annex, and with the full application of the relevant decisions that have been taken;  



A/C.1/69/L.63 
 

 

14-62991 4/5 

 

 7. Notes with concern that, along with the threat of the possible production, 

acquisition and use of chemical weapons by States, the international community also 

faces the danger of the production, acquisition and use of chemical weapons by 

non-State actors, including terrorists, concerns which have highlighted the necessit y 

of achieving universal adherence to the Convention, as well as the high level of 

readiness of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and stresses  

that the full and effective implementation of all provisions of the Convention, 

including those on national implementation (article VII) and assistance and 

protection (article X), constitutes an important contribution to the efforts of the 

United Nations in the global fight against terrorism in all its forms and 

manifestations; 

 8. Notes that the effective application of the verification system builds 

confidence in compliance with the Convention by States parties;

Chemical Weapons in verifying compliance with the provisions of the Convention 

as well as in promoting the timely and efficient accomplishment of all its objectives;

threats as articulated in article X, and welcomes the effectiveness and efficiency of 

the increased focus on making full use of regional and subregional capacities and 

expertise, including taking advantage of established training centres;  

 13. Reaffirms that the provisions of the Convention shall be implemented in 

a manner that avoids hampering the economic or technological development of 

States parties and international cooperation in the field of chemical activities for 

purposes not prohibited under the Convention, including the international exchange 

of scientific and technical information, and chemicals and equipment for the 

production, processing or use of chemicals for purposes not prohibited under the 

Convention; 

 14. Emphasizes the importance of the provisions of article XI of the 

Convention relating to the economic and technological development of States 

parties, recalls that the full, effective and non-discriminatory implementation of 

those provisions contributes to universality, and also reaffirms the undertaking of 

the States parties to foster international cooperation for peaceful purposes in the

cooperation and its contribution to the promotion of the Convention as a whole;
