  Angola, Belarus, Botswana, Burundi, Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, Ethiopia,

(Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam and Zimbabwe: draft resolution 
 
 

  Composition of the staff of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling paragraph 5 (g) of its resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, in which 
it decided that the Human Rights Council should assume the role and 
responsibilities of the Commission on Human Rights relating to the work of the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as decided by 
the General Assembly in its resolution 48/141 of 20 December 1993, 

 Recalling also Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2004/73 of 21 April 
20041 and 2005/72 of 20 April 2005,2 

 Taking note of the relevant reports of the High Commissioner3 and the Joint 
Inspection Unit,4 

 Bearing in mind that the skewed nature of the actual composition of the staff 
could result in diminishing the effectiveness of the work of the Office if it is 
perceived to be culturally biased and unrepresentative of the United Nations as a 
whole,

 Regretting that efforts to address the imbalance regarding the regional 
geographic diversity of the staff have not resulted in a significant improvement, 

 1. Decides, while considering the report of the Joint Inspection Unit:4 

 (a) To provide concrete support and guidance to the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights in her ongoing efforts to overcome the status quo; 

 (b) To allow, in the effort to redress the specific geographic imbalance of the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the 
establishment of a mechanism whereby recruitment of staff in the Office at the P-2 
level would not be restricted to successful candidates from the national competitive 
examination; 

 (c) To re-evaluate the financing of human rights activities, as noted in the 
report of the Joint Inspection Unit, with a view to increasing the support from core 
resources; 

 2. Encourages participation from a broader range of Member States in the 
associate experts programme and, in this respect, urges participants to increase 
sponsorship of associate experts from developing countries; 

 3. Requests the Joint Inspection Unit to assist the Human Rights Council to 
monitor systematically the implementation of the present resolution, inter alia, by 
submitting in May 2008 to the Human Rights Council a follow-up comprehensive 
report on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the 
Joint Inspection Unit pending their fulfilment; 

 4. Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights: 

 (a) To take further measures for the full and effective implementation of the 
recommendations of the Joint Inspection Unit;  

 (b) To submit a comprehensive and updated report on the basis of paragraph 
26 (e) of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/72 to the Human Rights 
Council at its fourth session and to the General Assembly at its sixty-third session; 

 5. Decides to continue its consideration of the question at its sixty-second 
session.
