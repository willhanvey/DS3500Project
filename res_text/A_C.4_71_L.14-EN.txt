follow-up and access to donor-funded projects of development cooperation and 

humanitarian assistance, throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including

children and women, continue to be held in Israeli prisons or detention centres 

under harsh conditions, including, inter alia, unhygienic conditions, solitary 

confinement, the extensive use of administrative detention of excessive duration 

without charge and denial of due process, lack of proper medical care and 

widespread medical neglect, including for prisoners who are ill, with the risk of 

fatal consequences, and denial of family visits, that impair their well -being, and

of torture of any Palestinian prisoners,  

 Expressing deep concern about the recent hunger strikes by numerous 

Palestinian prisoners in protest of the harsh conditions of their imprisonment and 

detention by the occupying Power, while taking note of the agreement reached in

immediate implementation,
