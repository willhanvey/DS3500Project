Draft resolution

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its previous resolutions concerning the situation in Somalia, in
particular resolution 733 (1992) of 23 January 1992, which established an embargo
on all delivery of weapons and military equipment to Somalia (hereinafter referred
to as the “arms embargo”), resolution 1356 (2001) of 19 June 2001, resolution 1407
(2002) of 3 May 2002, resolution 1425 (2002) of 22 July 2002, resolution 1474
(2003) of 8 April 2003, and the statements of its President of 12 March 2003
(S/PRST/2003/2), and of 11 November 2003 (S/PRST/2003/19),

Reiterating its firm support for the Somali National Reconciliation Process and
the ongoing Somali National Reconciliation Conference, commending the efforts of
Kenya as the host of the Conference sponsored by the Intergovernmental Authority
on Development (IGAD), and reaffirming the importance of the sovereignty,
territorial integrity, political independence and unity of Somalia, consistent with the
purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,

Reiterating its insistence that all States, in particular those of the region,
should not interfere in the internal affairs of Somalia. Such interference only further
destabilizes Somalia, contributes to a climate of fear and impacts adversely on
human rights, and could jeopardize the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political
independence and unity of Somalia. Stressing that the territory of Somalia should
not be used to undermine stability in the subregion,

Reiterating its serious concern over the continued flow of weapons and
ammunition supplies to and through Somalia from sources outside the country, in
contravention of the arms embargo, bearing in mind that the Somali National
Reconciliation Process and the implementation of the arms embargo serve as
mutually reinforcing processes,

Having considered the report of the Panel of Experts dated 4 November 2003
(S/2003/l035) submitted pursuant to paragraph 7 of resolution 1474 (2003),

Welcoming the mission of the Committee established pursuant to resolution
751 (1992) of 24 April 1992 (hereinafter referred to as “the Committee”), led by the
Chairman of the Committee, to the States in the region from 11 to 21 November
2003 as a step towards giving full effect to the arms embargo,

Reiterating the importance of improving the implementation and enhancing the
monitoring of the arms embargo in Somalia through persistent and vigilant
