world today and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, in

the single biggest obstacle to meeting the needs and protecting and promoting the 
rights of children, and that urgent national and international action is therefore 
required to eliminate it, 

 Reaffirming that democracy, development, peace and security, and the full and 
effective enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms are 
interdependent and mutually reinforcing and contribute to the eradication of extreme 
poverty,

policies and programmes relating to children, and recognizing the child as a rights 
holder in all policies and programmes relating to children, 

 Welcoming the holding of a commemorative high-level plenary meeting, which 
will take place on 11 and 12 December 2007, to evaluate progress made in the

framework for all actions concerning children, including adolescents; 

 2. Urges States that have not yet done so to become parties to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child2 and the Optional Protocols thereto3 as a 
matter of priority and to implement them fully by, inter alia, putting in place 
effective national legislation, policies and action plans, strengthening relevant 
governmental structures for children and ensuring adequate and systematic training 
in the rights of the child for all those working with and for children, as well as 
ensuring child rights education for children themselves; 

 3. Urges States parties to withdraw reservations that are incompatible with 
the object and purpose of the Convention or the Optional Protocols thereto and to 
consider reviewing regularly other reservations with a view to withdrawing them in 
accordance with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action;4 



A/C.3/62/L.24/Rev.1  
 

07-60270 4

comments;  

 7. Requests all relevant organs and mechanisms of the United Nations 
system regularly and systematically to incorporate a strong child rights perspective 
throughout all activities in the fulfilment of their mandates, as well as to ensure that 
their staff are trained in child rights matters, and calls upon States to continue to 
cooperate closely with all those organs and mechanisms, in particular the special 
rapporteurs and special representatives of the United Nations system; 

 8. Encourages States to strengthen their national statistical capacities and to 
use statistics disaggregated, inter alia, by age, gender and other relevant factors that 
may lead to disparities and other statistical indicators at the national, subregional, 
regional and international levels to develop and assess social policies and 
programmes so that economic and social resources are used efficiently and 
effectively for the full realization of the rights of the child;  
 

  II 
Protection and promotion of the rights of the child and non-discrimination 
against children 
 

  Non-discrimination 
 

 9. Calls upon all States to ensure the enjoyment by children of all their 
civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights without discrimination of any 
kind;  

 10. Notes with concern the large number of children who are victims of

 A/C.3/62/L.24/Rev.1
 

5 07-60270 
 

full consent of the intending spouses and forced sterilization, by enacting and 
enforcing legislation and, where appropriate, by formulating comprehensive, 
multidisciplinary and coordinated national plans, programmes or strategies to 
protect girls;  

 12. Also calls upon States to take the necessary measures to ensure the full 
and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by children with 
disabilities in both the public and the private spheres, including access to good 
quality education and health care and protection from violence, abuse and neglect, 
and to develop and, where it already exists, to enforce legislation to prohibit 
discrimination against them in order to ensure their inherent dignity, promote their 
self-reliance and facilitate their active participation and integration in the 
community, taking into account the particularly difficult situation of children with 
disabilities living in poverty;  

 13. Urges all States to respect and promote the right of girls and boys to 
express themselves freely, to ensure that their views are given due weight, in

taking into account the evolving capacities of children and the importance of 
involving children’s organizations and child-led initiatives; 

 14. Also urges all States in particular to strengthen the participation of 
children and adolescents in planning and implementation relating to matters that 
affect them, such as health, environment, education, social and economic welfare 
and protection against violence, abuse and exploitation; 
 

  Registration, family relations and adoption or other forms of alternative care

the child’s identity, including nationality, name and family relations, as recognized 
by law, to allow for the registration of the child immediately after birth, to ensure 
that registration procedures are simple, expeditious and effective and provided at 
minimal or no cost and to raise awareness of the importance of birth registration at 
the national, regional and local levels;  

 16. Encourages States to adopt and enforce laws and improve the 
implementation of policies and programmes to protect children growing up without 
parents or caregivers, recognizing that, where alternative care is necessary, family-
and community-based care should be promoted over placement in institutions, and 
in this context welcomes the ongoing process aimed at elaborating a set of United 
Nations guidelines for the appropriate use and conditions of alternative care for 
children, which are aimed at enhancing the implementation of the Convention and 
of other relevant legal international human rights instruments, regarding the 
protection and well-being of children who are in need of alternative care or who are 
at risk of becoming so;  

 17. Calls upon States to guarantee, to the extent consistent with the

common responsibilities for the upbringing and development of their children;  

 18. Also calls upon States to address and pay particular attention to cases of 
international parental or familial child abduction, and encourages States to engage in 
multilateral and bilateral cooperation to resolve these cases, preferably by accession 
to or ratification of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International

to facilitate, inter alia, the return of the child to the country in which he or she 
resided immediately before the removal or retention;

 21. Calls upon States to cooperate, support and participate in the global 
efforts for poverty eradication at the global, regional and country levels, recognizing 
that strengthened availability and effective allocation of resources are required at all 
these levels, in order to ensure that all the internationally agreed development and 
poverty eradication goals, including those set out in the United Nations Millennium 
Declaration,5 are realized within their time framework, and reaffirms that 
investments in children and the realization of their rights are among the most 
effective ways to eradicate poverty;

necessary resources, support and efforts to eradicate poverty, according to national

all children, ensuring that all children have access to education of good quality, as 
well as making secondary education generally available and accessible to all, in

that special measures to ensure equal access, including affirmative action, contribute
