good neighbourliness, non-interference and regional cooperation,

Recalling that it endorsed the Agreement signed by the Ivorian political forces
in Linas-Marcoussis on 24 January 2003 (S/2003/99) (the Linas-Marcoussis
Agreement) approved by the Conference of Heads of State on Côte d’Ivoire, held in
Paris on 25 and 26 January 2003, the Agreement signed in Accra on 30 July 2004

Commending the efforts of the Secretary-General, the African Union, in

Recalling strongly the obligations of all Ivorian parties, the Government of

Taking note of the final communiqué of the Kimberley Process Plenary
Meeting held in Moscow from 15 to 17 November 2005 and of the resolution
adopted by Kimberley Process participants at that meeting setting out concrete
measures to prevent the introduction of diamonds from Côte d’Ivoire into the
legitimate diamond trade, and recognizing the linkage between the illegal
exploitation of natural resources such as diamonds, illicit trade in such resources,
and the proliferation and trafficking of arms and the recruitment and use of
mercenaries as one of the sources of fuelling and exacerbating conflicts in West
Africa,

Taking note also of the report of the United Nations Panel of Experts on Côte
d’Ivoire dated 7 November 2005 (S/2005/699),
