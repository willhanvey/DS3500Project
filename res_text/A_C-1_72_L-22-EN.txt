  Reducing nuclear danger 
 

 

 The General Assembly,  

 Bearing in mind that the use of nuclear weapons poses the most serious threat 

to mankind and to the survival of civilization,  

 Reaffirming that any use or threat of use of nuclear weapons would constitute 

a violation of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 Convinced that the proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects would 

seriously enhance the danger of nuclear war,  

 Convinced also that nuclear disarmament and the complete elimination of 

nuclear weapons are essential to remove the danger of nuclear war,  

 Considering that, until nuclear weapons cease to exist, it is imperative on the 

part of the nuclear-weapon States to adopt measures that assure non-nuclear-weapon 

States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons,  

 Considering also that the hair-trigger alert of nuclear weapons carries 

unacceptable risks of unintentional or accidental use of nuclear weapons, which 

would have catastrophic consequences for all mankind,  

 Emphasizing the need to adopt measures to avoid accidental, unauthorized or 

unexplained incidents arising from computer anomalies or other technical 

malfunctions, 

 Conscious that limited steps relating to de-alerting and de-targeting have been 

taken by the nuclear-weapon States and that further practical, realistic and mutually 

reinforcing steps are necessary to contribute to the improvement in the international 

climate for negotiations leading to the elimination of nuclear weapons,  



A/C.1/72/L.22 
 

 

17-17945 2/2 

 

 Mindful that a diminishing role for nuclear weapons in the security policies of 

nuclear-weapon States would have a positive impact on international peace and 

security and improve the conditions for the further reduction and the elimination of 

nuclear weapons, 

 Reiterating the highest priority accorded to nuclear disarmament in the Final 

Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly
1
 and by the 

international community, 

 Recalling the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the 

legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons
2
 that there exists an obligation for 

all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to 

nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international 

control, 

 Recalling also the call, in the United Nations Millennium Declaration,
3
 to seek 

to eliminate the dangers posed by weapons of mass destruction and the resolve to 

strive for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear 

weapons, including the possibility of convening an international conference to 

identify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers,  

 1. Calls for a review of nuclear doctrines and, in this context, immediate 

and urgent steps to reduce the risks of unintentional and accidental use of nuclear 

weapons, including through de-alerting and de-targeting nuclear weapons;  

 2. Requests the five nuclear-weapon States to take measures towards the 

implementation of paragraph 1 above;  

 3. Calls upon Member States to take the measures necessary to prevent the 

proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects and to promote nuclear 

disarmament, with the objective of eliminating nuclear weapons; 

 4. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General submitted pursuant to 

paragraph 5 of its resolution 71/37 of 5 December 2016;
4
 

 5. Requests the Secretary-General to intensify efforts and support initiatives 

that would contribute to the full implementation of the seven recommendations 

identified in the report of the Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters that would 

significantly reduce the risk of nuclear war,
5
 and also to continue to encourage 

Member States to consider the convening of an international conference, as 

proposed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration,
3
 to identify ways of 

eliminating nuclear dangers, and to report thereon to the General Assembly at i ts 

seventy-third session; 

 6. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-third session, 

under the item entitled “General and complete disarmament”, the sub -item entitled 

“Reducing nuclear danger”.
