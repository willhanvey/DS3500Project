  Compliance with non-proliferation, arms limitation and

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 60/55 of 8 December 2005 and other relevant 
resolutions on the question, and noting the report of the Panel of Government 
Experts on verification in all its aspects,1 

 Recognizing the abiding concern of all Member States for ensuring respect for 
the rights and obligations arising from treaties to which they are parties and from 
other sources of international law, 

 Convinced that observance by Member States of the Charter of the United 
Nations and compliance with non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament 
agreements to which they are parties and with other agreed obligations are essential 
for regional and global peace, security and stability, 

 Stressing that failure by States parties to comply with such agreements and 
with other agreed obligations not only adversely affects the security of States parties 
but also can create security risks for other States relying on the constraints and 
commitments stipulated in those agreements,

 Stressing also that the viability and effectiveness of non-proliferation, arms 
limitation and disarmament agreements and of other agreed obligations require that 
those agreements be fully complied with and enforced, 

 Concerned by non-compliance by some States with their respective obligations, 

 Noting that verification and compliance, and enforcement in a manner 
consistent with the Charter, are integrally related, 

 Recognizing the importance of and support for effective national, regional, and 
international capacities for such verification, compliance, and enforcement, 

 Recognizing also that full compliance by States with all their respective 
non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament agreements and with other 
agreed obligations they have undertaken contributes to efforts to prevent the 
development and proliferation, contrary to international obligations, of weapons of 
mass destruction, related technologies and means of delivery, as well as to efforts to 
deny non-State actors access to such capabilities, 

 1. Underscores the contribution that compliance with non-proliferation, 
arms limitation and disarmament agreements and with other agreed obligations 
makes to enhancing confidence and to strengthening international security and 
stability; 

 2. Urges all States to implement and to comply fully with their respective 
obligations; 

 3. Calls upon all Member States to encourage and, for those States in a 
position to do so, to appropriately assist States which request assistance to increase 
their capacity to implement fully their obligations; 

 4. Also calls upon all concerned States to take concerted action, in a manner 
consistent with relevant international law, to encourage, through bilateral and 
multilateral means, the compliance by all States with their respective 
non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament agreements and with other 
agreed obligations, and to hold those not in compliance with such agreements 
accountable for their non-compliance in a manner consistent with the Charter of the 
United Nations; 

 5. Urges those States not currently in compliance with their respective 
obligations and commitments to make the strategic decision to come back into 
compliance; 

 6. Encourages efforts by all States, the United Nations and other 
international organizations, pursuant to their respective mandates, to take action, 
consistent with the Charter, to prevent serious damage to international security and 
stability arising from non-compliance by States with their existing non-proliferation, 
arms limitation and disarmament obligations.
