Reaffirming also that, by virtue of the principle of self-determination, all

respect this right in accordance with the provisions of the Charter,

Reaffirming further the Declaration on Principles of International Law

Charter of the United Nations,2

Alarmed and concerned at the danger that the activities of mercenaries
constitute to peace and security in developing countries, in particular in Africa and
in small States,

Deeply concerned at the loss of life, the substantial damage to property and the
negative effects on the policy and economies of affected countries resulting from
criminal mercenary activities,

Convinced that, notwithstanding the way in which they are used or the form
they take to acquire some semblance of legitimacy, mercenaries or mercenary-
related activities are a threat to peace, security and the self-determination of peoples
and an obstacle to the enjoyment of human rights by peoples,

1. Welcomes the report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on
Human Rights on the question of the use of mercenaries as a means of violating
human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-

vigilance against the menace posed by the activities of mercenaries and to take
legislative measures to ensure that their territories and other territories under their
control, as well as their nationals, are not used for the recruitment, assembly,
financing, training and transit of mercenaries for the planning of activities designed
to impede the right of peoples to self-determination, to destabilize or overthrow the
Government of any State or to dismember or impair, totally or in part, the territorial
integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent States conducting
themselves in compliance with the right of peoples to self-determination;

5. Stresses the entry into force of the International Convention against the
Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries,4 and calls upon all States

restricts the recruitment, assembly, financing, training and transit of mercenaries;

8. Calls upon States to investigate the possibility of mercenary involvement
whenever and wherever criminal acts of a terrorist nature occur and to bring to trial
those found responsible or to consider their extradition, if so requested, in
accordance with domestic law and applicable bilateral or international treaties;

9. Welcomes the convening by the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights of the second meeting of experts on the question of
traditional and new forms of mercenary activities as a means of violating human
rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination, and
recognizes its contribution to the process of formulating a clearer legal definition of
mercenaries that would make more efficient the prevention and punishment of
mercenary activities;

10. Requests the Special Rapporteur to continue working to propose a clearer
definition of mercenaries, including clear nationality criteria, based on his findings,
the proposals of States and the outcomes of the meetings of experts, and to make
suggestions on the procedure to be followed for international adoption of a new
definition;

11. Requests the Office of the High Commissioner, as a matter of priority, to
publicize the adverse effects of the activities of mercenaries on the right of peoples
to self-determination and, when requested and where necessary, to render advisory
services to States that are affected by the activities of mercenaries;

12. Requests the Special Rapporteur to continue taking into account in the
discharge of his mandate the fact that mercenary activities continue to occur in many
parts of the world and are taking on new forms, manifestations and modalities;

13. Urges all States to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur in the
fulfilment of his mandate;

14. Requests the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner to provide
the Special Rapporteur with all the necessary assistance and support for the
fulfilment of his mandate, both professional and financial, including through the
promotion of cooperation between the Special Rapporteur and other components of
the United Nations system that deal with countering mercenary-related activities;

15. Requests the Special Rapporteur to consult States and intergovernmental
and non-governmental organizations in the implementation of the present resolution
and to report, with specific recommendations, to the General Assembly at its fifty-
eighth session his findings on the use of mercenaries to undermine the right of
peoples to self-determination;

16. Decides to consider at its fifty-eighth session the question of the use of
mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the
right of peoples to self-determination under the item entitled “Right of peoples to
self-determination”.
