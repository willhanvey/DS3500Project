expressing its concern that the recommendations of the two previous reviews have

organization based in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was able to submit 

a stakeholder report in the context of the universal periodic review process,

welfare and inherent dignity of the people in the country, as referred to by the Security

situation and the adverse impact on the human rights situation in the Democratic 

People’s Republic of Korea following the global outbreak of the coronavirus di sease 

(COVID-19) pandemic, stressing that any restrictions to address the pandemic must

Korea, notably since the investigations on all the Japanese nationals commenced on 

the basis of the government-level consultations held between the Democratic People’s

systematic, widespread and gross violations of human rights in and by the Democratic 

People’s Republic of Korea, including those that may amount to crimes against 

humanity according to the commission of inquiry on human rights in the Democratic 

People’s Republic of Korea, established by the Human Rights Council in its 

resolution 22/13 of 21 March 2013,13 and those identified by the group of independent

punishments extending up to three generations; and the extensive use of forced 

labour; 

 (ii) The existence of an extensive system of political prison camps, where a 

vast number of persons are deprived of their liberty and subjected to deplorable 

conditions, including forced labour, and where alarming violations of human 

rights are perpetrated; 

 (iii) Enforced and involuntary disappearances of persons by arrest, detention 

or abduction against their will; refusal to disclose the fate and whereabouts of 

the persons concerned; and refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of their 

liberty, which places such persons subjected thereto outside the protection of 

the law and which has had the effect of inflicting severe suffering on them and 

their families; 

 (iv) The forcible transfer of populations and the limitations imposed on every 

person who wishes to move freely within the country and travel abroad, 

including the punishment of those who leave or try to leave the country without 

permission, or their families, as well as punishment of persons who are returned; 

 (v) The situation of refugees and asylum seekers expelled or returned to the 

Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and retaliations against citizens of the 

Democratic People’s Republic of Korea who have been repatriated from abroad, 

leading to punishments of internment, torture, other cruel, inhuman or degrading 

treatment or punishment, sexual and gender-based violence or the death penalty, 

and in this regard strongly urges all States to respect the fundamental principle 

of non-refoulement, to treat those who seek refuge humanely and to ensure 

unhindered access to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and 

his Office, with a view to protecting the human rights of those who seek refuge, 

and once again urges States parties to comply with their obligations under the 

1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees16 and the 1967 Protocol 

thereto17 in relation to refugees from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea 

who are covered by those instruments;  

 (vi) All-pervasive and severe restrictions, both online and offline, on the 

freedoms of thought, conscience, religion or belief, opinion and expression, 

peaceful assembly and association, the right to privacy and equal access to 

information, by such means as the unlawful and arbitrary surveillance, 

persecution, torture, and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 

punishment, imprisonment and, in some instances, summary executions of 

individuals exercising their freedom of opinion and expression, religion or 

belief, and their families, and the right of everyone, including women, to take 

part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen 

representatives, of his or her country;  

 (vii) Violations of economic, social and cultural rights, which have led to food 

insecurity, severe hunger, malnutrition, widespread health problems and other 

hardship for the population in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, in 

particular for women, children, persons with disabilities, older per sons and 

political prisoners; 

 (viii) Violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and

 (ix) Violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of children, in 

particular the continued lack of access to basic economic, social and cultural 

rights for many children, and in this regard notes the particularly vulnerable

the prohibition of the economic exploitation of children and of any harmful or 

hazardous work of children as defined by the obligations of the Democratic 

People’s Republic of Korea under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as 

well as the exploitation of workers sent abroad from the Democratic People’s 

Republic of Korea to work under conditions that reportedly amount to forced 

labour, emphasizing in this context the importance of the full implementation of 

the requirement that nationals of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea 

earning income overseas be repatriated, subject to applicable national and 

international law, by 22 December 2019 pursuant to paragraph 8 of Security 

Council resolution 2397 (2017), the provision of final reports by March 2020

People’s Republic of Korea to promote, respect and protect the human rights of 

workers, including workers repatriated to the Democratic People’s Republic of 

Korea;

the basis of State-assigned social class and birth and also includes consideration 

of political opinions and religion;  

 (xiii) Violence and discrimination against women, including unequal access to 

employment, discriminatory laws and regulations;  

 (b) The continued refusal of the Government of the Democratic People’s

other United Nations human rights mechanisms;

of the treaty bodies; 

 3. Condemns the systematic abduction, denial of repatriation and subsequent 

enforced disappearance of persons, including those from other countries, on  a large 

scale and as a matter of State policy, and in this regard strongly calls upon the 

Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea urgently to resolve these 

issues of international grave concern, in a transparent manner, including by ensuring 

the immediate return of abductees; 

 4. Underscores its very serious concern  regarding reports of torture and other 

cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, summary executions, arbitrary

Democratic People’s Republic of Korea commits against citizens of other countries 

within and outside of its territory;  

 5. Expresses its very deep concern at the precarious humanitarian situation 

in the country, which could rapidly deteriorate owing to limited capacity and 

resilience to natural disasters and health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, to 

government policies causing limitations in the availability of and access to adequate 

food, compounded by structural weaknesses in agricultural production resulting in 

significant shortages of diversified food, and the State restrictions on the cultivation 

of and trade in foodstuffs, as well as the prevalence of chronic and acute malnutrition, 

particularly among the most vulnerable groups, pregnant and lactating women, 

children, persons with disabilities, older persons and prisoners, including political 

prisoners, exacerbated due to lack of access to basic services, including health care 

as well as water, sanitation and hygiene services, as well as the outbreak of the global 

COVID-19 pandemic, and urges the Government of the Democratic People’s 

Republic of Korea, in this regard, to take preventive and remedial action, cooperating 

with international donor and humanitarian agencies for accessing people belonging 

to vulnerable groups, facilitating the implementation of programmes and monitoring 

humanitarian assistance consistent with international standards;

Commissioner for Human Rights23 on steps taken pursuant to Human Rights Council 

resolutions 34/24 of 24 March 201724 and 40/20 of 22 March 201925 to strengthen the

 Gravely concerned that the provisions of those resolutions and relevant

United Nations system have not been implemented by the Russian Federation,  

 Taking into account the consideration of its agenda item entitled “The situation 

in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine”,

the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol (hereinafter “Crimea”) – 

by the Russian Federation, and reaffirming the non-recognition of its annexation, 

 Recalling that the General Assembly, in its resolution 3314 (XXIX), states that 

no territorial acquisition or special advantage resulting from aggression is or shall be 

recognized as lawful, 

 Affirming that the seizure of Crimea by force is illegal and a violation of

efforts to put an end to the Russian occupation of Crimea, and welcoming the 

commitments by Ukraine to protecting the human rights and fundamental freedoms 

of all its citizens and its cooperation with human rights treaty bodies and international 

institutions, 

 Recalling that organs and officials of the Russian Federation established in the 

temporarily occupied Crimea are illegitimate and should be referred to as “occupying 

authorities of the Russian Federation”,  

 Concerned that applicable international human rights obligations and treaties, 

to which Ukraine is a party, are not fully respected by the occupying Power in Crimea, 

thus significantly decreasing the level of human rights in Crimea since its temporary 

occupation by the Russian Federation,

or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities may exercise fully and effectively al l

equality before the law,

occupying Power to Crimea, despite their existing mandates, which cover the entire 

territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, and emphasizing 

the indispensable value that the human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine should 

provide in monitoring the human rights situation in Crimea as a priority activity 

according to its mandate, 

 Concerned about additional challenges for the enjoyment of human rights and 

fundamental freedoms by residents of Crimea resulting from unnecessary and 

disproportionate restrictive measures taken by the occupying Power under the pretext 

of combating the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as about the 

lack of ensuring and maintaining public health and hygiene, including mea sures on 

preventing the spread of COVID-19, in Crimea by the occupying Power in accordance 

with the international humanitarian law, 

 Expressing its grave concern about the inadequate conditions of detention in 

penitentiary institutions, including overcrowded cells and a lack of proper medical care,

 Recalling the prohibition under international humanitarian law for the 

occupying Power to compel the inhabitants of an occupied territory to swear 

allegiance to the occupying Power,  

 Condemning the imposition and retroactive application of the legal system of 

the Russian Federation, and its negative impact on the human rights situation in 

Crimea, the imposition of automatic Russian citizenship on protected persons in 

Crimea, which is contrary to international humanitarian law, including the Geneva 

Conventions and customary international law, and the deportation, regressive effects 

on the enjoyment of human rights and effective restriction of land ownership of those 

who have rejected that citizenship,  

 Gravely concerned by consistent reports that the Russian law enforcement 

system uses involuntary placement in a psychiatric institution as a form of harassment 

against and punishment of political opponents and activists,  

 Deeply concerned about continued reports that the law enforcement system of 

the Russian Federation conducts searches and raids of private homes, businesses and 

meeting places in Crimea, which disproportionally affect Crimean Tatars, and recalling 

that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibits arbitrary or 

unlawful interference with a person’s privacy, family, home or correspondence,  

 Gravely concerned that, since 2014, torture has reportedly been used by the 

Russian authorities to extract false confessions for politically motivated prosecutions, 

and expressing deep concern about the ongoing arbitrary detentions and arrests by the 

Russian Federation of Ukrainian citizens, including Emir-Usein Kuku, Server 

Mustafayev and many others,

of social, cultural and economic rights by residents, including children, women, older 

persons, persons with disabilities and other persons belonging to the groups in 

vulnerable and marginalized situations, 

 Condemning the reported serious violations and abuses committed against 

residents of Crimea, in particular extrajudicial killings, abductions, enforced 

disappearances, politically motivated prosecutions, discrimination, harassment, 

intimidation, violence, including sexual violence, arbitrary detentions and arrests, 

torture and ill-treatment, in particular to extract confessions, and psychiatric internment,

 Expressing concern about the militarization and assimilation of young people in 

Crimea by the Russian Federation and its blocking of the access of Crimeans to 

Ukrainian education, 

 Gravely concerned by the above-mentioned policies and practices of the 

Russian Federation, which cause a continuing threat and have caused a large number 

of Crimean residents to flee from Crimea,  

 Recalling that individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of 

protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying Power, or 

to that of any other country, occupied or not, and the deportation or transfer by an 

occupying Power of parts of its own civilian population into the territory that it 

occupies, are prohibited under international humanitarian law, regardless of their 

motive, 

 Deeply concerned by consistent reports that the Russian Federation promotes 

policies and conducts practices aimed at changing the demographic structure in 

Crimea, and recalling in this respect that the occupying Power shall not deport or 

transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory that it occupies,  

 Reaffirming the right of return of all internally displaced persons and refugees 

affected by the temporary occupation of Crimea by the Russian Federation to their 

homes in Crimea, and therefore stressing the need to respect their property rights and 

to refrain from obtaining property in violation of applicable international law,  

 Concerned about additional challenges for the enjoyment of human rights by 

residents of Crimea resulting from disruptive activities of the occupying Power, 

including the construction of infrastructure projects accompanied by the 

expropriation of land, demolition of houses and depletion of natural and agricultural 

resources, which have a negative impact on the physical character of Crimea and thus 

contribute to changing the economic and demographic structure of Crimea, 

 Reaffirming its serious concern that, according to the decision of the so-called 

“Supreme Court of Crimea” of 26 April 2016 and the decision of the Supreme Court 

of the Russian Federation of 29 September 2016, the Mejlis of the Crimean Ta tar 

People, the self-governing body of the Crimean Tatars, continues to be declared an 

extremist organization and the ban on its activities has still not been repealed,

of Crimea and the failure of the occupying Power to respect fair trial standards,  

 Condemning the continuous widespread misuse of counter-terrorism and 

anti-extremism laws to suppress dissent, 

 Strongly condemning in this regard the ongoing pressure and mass detentions

right to hold opinions and to freedom of expression and the enjoyment of other human 

rights and fundamental freedoms, concerned about reports that journalists, media 

workers and citizen journalists continue to face unjustified interference with their 

reporting activities in Crimea, and expressing deep concern that journalists, media 

workers and citizen journalists have been arbitrarily arrested, detained, prosecuted, 

harassed and intimidated in Crimea as a direct result for their reporting activities,  

 Underlining the importance of the measures to develop transparent, accessible, 

non-discriminatory and expeditious procedures and regulations governing access to 

Crimea for human rights defenders, journalists, media workers and lawyers, as well 

as the possibility to appeal, in accordance with national legislation and in conformity 

with all applicable international law, 

 Condemning the blocking by the Russian Federation of Ukrainian websites and 

television channels and the seizure of Ukrainian transmission frequencies in Crimea,  

 Welcoming the support provided by Ukraine to media outlets and civil society 

organizations that have fled Crimea, which improves the ability of the media and civil 

society to work independently and without interference,  

 Concerned about the continuing impunity in reported cases of enforced 

disappearances perpetrated in Crimea,

Security Service of the Russian Federation allegedly tortured or ill -treated Crimean 

residents following their arrests, including by using beatings, electric shocks and 

suffocation against victims, 

 Welcoming the continued efforts of the Secretary-General, the United Nations

Rohingya Muslims and other minorities, perpetrated by the security and armed forces 

of Myanmar, which, according to the fact-finding mission, undoubtedly amount to the 

gravest crimes under international law,  

 Expressing deep concern at the limited progress on the fact-finding mission’s 

recommendations to conduct prompt, effective, thorough, independent and impartial 

investigations and to hold perpetrators accountable for crimes committed across 

Myanmar, 

 Concerned that, contrary to the fact-finding mission’s recommendations, laws, 

orders, policies and practices at all levels of Government limiting freedoms of 

movement, expression, association and assembly, or which are discriminatory in their 

application or impact, have not been reviewed, amended or repealed,  

 Welcoming the work of the Independent Mechanism for Myanmar, established 

by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 39/2, to collect, consolidate, preserve 

and analyse evidence of the most serious international crimes and violations of 

international law committed in Myanmar since 2011, in particular in Rakhine, Kachin 

and Shan States, making use of the information handed over by the independent 

international fact-finding mission, and to prepare files in order to facilitate and 

expedite fair and independent criminal proceedings, in accordance with interna tional 

law standards, in national, regional or international courts or tribunals that have, or 

may in the future have, jurisdiction over these crimes, in accordance with 

international law, 

 Welcoming also the second report of the Independent Mechanism for Myanmar, 

established by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 39/2, to the General 

Assembly,11 

 Recognizing the complementary and mutually reinforcing work of the various 

United Nations mandate holders and mechanisms, including international justice and 

accountability mechanisms working on Myanmar to improve the situation of human 

rights in Myanmar, 

 Recognizing also the importance of the role of regional organizations in efforts 

to achieve pacific settlement of local disputes, as stipulated in Chapter VIII of the 

Charter, while noting that such efforts do not preclude action under Chapter VI of the 

Charter, 

 Acknowledging the efforts of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation,

 Taking note of the ongoing processes to ensure justice and accountability in 

respect of alleged crimes committed against Rohingya Muslims and other minorities

of Genocide,13 which concluded that, prima facie, the Court had jurisdiction to deal 

with the case, which found that the Rohingya in Myanmar appeared to constitute a 

“protected group” within the meaning of article 2 of the Convention, and that there 

was a real and imminent risk of irreparable prejudice to the rights of the Rohingya in 

Myanmar, and taking note that Myanmar submitted its report in response to the 

Court’s order on 22 May 2020, and measures adopted in this regard, 

 Noting the publication of the executive summary of the report of the 

Independent Commission of Enquiry established by the Government of Myanmar in 

2018, which, notwithstanding its limitations, acknowledges that war crimes, serious 

human rights violations and violations of domestic law had been committed by 

multiple actors and that there were reasonable grounds to believe that members of 

Myanmar security forces were involved,  

 Condemning all violations and abuses of human rights in Myanmar, including 

against Rohingya Muslims and other minorities, in particular in Rakhine, Chin, 

Kachin and Shan States, and expressing deep concern at the reports of ongoing human 

rights violations, as also noted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 

Rights, 

 Reiterating its deep concern at the violence between the Myanmar armed forces 

and the Arakan Army in Rakhine and Chin States, the continuing forced displacement 

of civilians, including of ethnic minorities, the recruitment and use of children, 

abductions, arbitrary detentions and killings, and the use of facilities functioning as 

schools for military purposes and for committing crimes, as well as reports of 

violations and abuses of human rights, including those involving the use of landmines, 

making conditions unsuitable for the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable return 

of all refugees and forcibly displaced persons, including Rohingya,  

 Reiterating the urgent need to ensure that all those responsible for crimes related 

to violations and abuses of international law throughout Myanmar, including 

international human rights law, international humanitarian law and international 

criminal law, are held to account through credible and independent national, regional 

or international justice mechanisms, while recalling the authority of the Security 

Council in this regard, 

 Expressing deep concern at the reports of violence by the Tatmadaw, which 

disproportionately affects the Rohingya civilians in Rakhine State, where schools, 

religious sites and homes have been targeted, 

 Continuing to underline the need for the security and armed forces of Myanmar 

and other armed groups to cease all actions that run counter to the protection of all 

persons within the country, including those belonging to the Rohingya community, by 

respecting international law, including international human rights law and 

international humanitarian law, and ending the violence, including sexual violence, 

and calling for urgent steps to ensure justice in respect of all human rights violations 

and violations of international humanitarian law so that those displaced by violence 

are able to voluntarily return in safety and dignity to their places of origin or to a 

place of their choice in a sustainable manner,  

 Alarmed at the continued attacks on humanitarian actors, and calling for all sides 

to abide by international law in this matter,  

 Reiterating its deep distress at reports that unarmed individuals in Rakhine State

human rights and international humanitarian law by the military and security and 

armed forces, including extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary killings, systematic rape

and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence, arbitrary detention, enforced 

disappearance and government seizure of Rohingya lands from which Rohingya 

Muslims were evicted and their homes destroyed, and remaining concerned by the 

previous large-scale destruction of homes and systematic evictions in northern 

Rakhine State, including the use of arson and violence, as well as the unlawful use of 

force by non-State actors, 

 Expressing concern that, in northern Rakhine State, the implementation of 

policies under the guise of economic development and reconstruction by the 

Government of Myanmar and the heavy militarization of the area have resulted in the 

alteration of the demographic structure, which further prevents the members of the 

displaced Rohingya Muslim population from returning to Rakhine State,  

 Recalling the Secretary-General’s call for a global ceasefire, as supported by 

Security Council resolution 2532 (2020) of 1 July 2020, and regretting that the 

Myanmar armed forces and the Arakan Army have not succeeded to date in 

establishing a bilateral ceasefire in conflict areas in Rakhine and Chin States, while 

stressing the need for continued de-escalation and an enduring ceasefire throughout 

the whole country, best achieved by dialogue between all parties, and encouraging 

them to announce a new ceasefire, 

 Welcoming the organization of the fourth session of the Union Peace Conference 

in August 2020, while calling upon the Government of Myanmar and non-State armed 

groups to accelerate progress in the peace process,  

 Reiterating its grave concern that, in spite of the fact that Rohingya Muslims 

lived in Myanmar for generations prior to the independence of Myanmar, held full 

documentation and participated actively in government and civic life, they were made 

stateless by the enactment of the 1982 Citizenship Law and were eventually 

disenfranchised, from 2015, from the electoral process,  

 Reaffirming that the denial of citizenship status and related rights to Rohingya 

Muslims and other minorities, including voting rights, is a serious human rights 

concern, 

 Re-emphasizing the right of all refugees and the importance of internally 

displaced persons being able to return home and that such returns should be in safety 

and dignity and in a voluntary and sustainable manner,  

 Expressing concern at the recent increase in the irregular maritime movement 

of Rohingya, risking their lives in perilous conditions at the hands of exploitative 

smugglers, which highlights their desperate situation and the urgent need to address 

the root causes of their plight, 

 Alarmed by the continued influx to Bangladesh over the last four decades of 

1.1 million Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, including the 860,000 currently living 

there, most of whom arrived since 25 August 2017 in the aftermath of atrocities 

committed by the security and armed forces of Myanmar, 

 Noting the extension for one year of the memorandum of understanding between 

Myanmar and the United Nations Development Programme and the Office of the 

United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on assistance in the repatriation 

process of displaced persons from Rakhine State, and calling upon Myanmar to grant 

United Nations agencies unfettered access to northern Rakhine State so that they can 

carry out this assistance, 

 Recalling some steps taken by the Government of Myanmar to create the 

conditions necessary for refugees and other forcibly displaced persons to return to 

their places of origin or to a place of their choice voluntarily, in safety and dignity, 

but regretting, however, that the situation has not improved in Rakhine State to create

the conditions necessary for refugees and other forcibly displaced persons to return 

to their places of origin voluntarily, safely and with dignity,  

 Reiterating its deep concern over the continued spread of false news, hate 

speech and inflammatory rhetoric, in particular through social media, not fully 

addressed by the authorities of Myanmar,  

 Underlining the urgency of the call by the Secretary-General for increased 

efforts to implement the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine 

State, to address the root causes of the crisis, including those on access to citizenship 

for the Rohingya, freedom of movement, the elimination of systematic segregation 

and all forms of discrimination, and inclusive and equal access to health services and 

education, and birth registration, in full consultation with members of all ethnic and 

minority groups and persons in vulnerable situations, including on matters of 

citizenship for the Rohingya people,  

 Welcoming the commitment of the Secretary-General to implementing the 

recommendations made by the independent inquiry into the involvement of the United 

Nations in Myanmar from 2010 to 2018,  

 Reiterating its urgent call upon the Government of Myanmar to sustain the 

democratic transition of Myanmar, including by working towards bringing all 

national institutions, including the military, under the democratically elected civilian 

Government, 

 Inviting the Government of Myanmar to learn from the challenges of holding 

the 2020 election and create an ongoing system to ensure free, fair, credible, inclusive 

and transparent elections, ensuring equal opportunity for the representation and the 

full, equal and meaningful participation of the Rohingya, other minorities and 

internally displaced persons, candidates and voters and that all people of Myanmar 

are able to cast their vote, allowing all candidates to contest elections fairly,  

 Welcoming the dialogue between the Government of Myanmar and the United 

Nations on addressing children and armed conflict as well as conflict-related sexual 

and gender-based violence in Myanmar, and the Myanmar National Human Rights 

Commission Strategic Plan (2020–2024), 

 Welcoming also the establishment by the Government of Myanmar of a 

committee for the prevention of grave violations against children in armed conflict, 

looking forward to its concrete results, including the development of a joint action 

plan to end and prevent further killing and maiming of children and rape and other 

forms of sexual violence against children, and welcoming the ratification of the 

Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of 

children in armed conflict,14 and calling all parties to end violations against children 

in armed conflict, 

 Commending the ongoing humanitarian efforts and commitments that the 

Government of Bangladesh, in cooperation with United Nations agencies and the 

international community, including all humanitarian actors, has extended to those 

fleeing human rights violations and abuses in Myanmar, 

 Welcoming the involvement of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in 

addressing the situation in Rakhine State, including through carrying out 

humanitarian assessments in northern Rakhine State through its Coordinating Centre

the need for closer engagement with the Rohingya refugee community, while 

encouraging close cooperation with all relevant United Nations agencies and 

international partners to address the root causes of the conflict, so that affected 

communities can rebuild their lives there,  

 Noting with concern the exacerbation of the existing humanitarian situation and 

the negative impact on the human rights situation in Myanmar, including access to 

education, following the global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, stressing 

that measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic must be targeted, necessary, 

transparent, non-discriminatory, time-bound, proportionate and in accordance with 

obligations under applicable international human rights law,  

 Recognizing the efforts of the Government of Myanmar to contain the spread of 

the COVID-19 virus and to balance the severe socioeconomic effects of the pandemic 

by setting up a COVID-19 economic relief plan and providing financial assistance to 

people especially affected by the crisis, while expressing its concern that the capacity 

of humanitarian and development actors to implement their programmes has been 

significantly reduced at a time when vulnerable parts of the population are in 

particular need of assistance and that, therefore, resources may be shifted  away from 

Myanmar, and stressing the need to ensure access to COVID-19-related information, 

supplies and medical services, 

 1. Expresses grave concern at continuing reports of serious human rights 

violations and abuses by the military and security forces as well as violations of

violence by the Syrian regime that foment sectarian tensions with in the Syrian 

population, 

 Reiterating that the only sustainable solution to the current crisis in the Syrian

work for free and fair elections and political transition in line with Security Council 

resolution 2254 (2015), with a view to establishing credible, inclusive and 

non-sectarian governance, with the full, equal and meaningful participation of women

20-16038 48/63 

 

 Welcoming the efforts of the Special Envoy in establishing the Constitutional 

Committee to advance United Nations efforts to achieve a sustainable political 

solution to the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic in line with Security Council 

resolution 2254 (2015), urging all parties to engage meaningfully in the work of the 

Committee, particularly the Syrian regime, and underlining that a political solution 

to the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic requires full implementation of all aspects 

of resolution 2254 (2015) including the holding of free and fair elections, under the 

supervision of the United Nations, to the satisfaction of the governance and to the 

highest international standards of transparency and accountability, with all Syrians, 

including displaced persons and refugees, eligible to participate, as well as the 

establishment of a neutral and safe environment,  

 Reconfirming its endorsement of the Geneva communiqué of 30 June 2012,33 

endorsing the joint statement on the outcome of the multilateral talks on Syria held in 

Vienna of 30 October 2015 and the statement of the International Syria Support Group 

of 14 November 2015 (the Vienna statements) in pursuit of the full implementation 

of the Geneva communiqué, facilitated by the Special Envoy, as the basis for a 

Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political transition in order to end the conflict in the 

Syrian Arab Republic, and stressing that the Syrian people will decide the future of 

the Syrian Arab Republic, 

 Welcoming the call made by the Secretary-General for a global ceasefire and 

that of the Special Envoy for a complete, immediate and nationwide ceasefire 

throughout the Syrian Arab Republic, as endorsed by the Security Council in its 

resolution 2532 (2020) of 1 July 2020, reaffirming that Member States must ensure 

that any measures taken to counter terrorism comply with all their obligations un der 

international law, in particular international human rights law, international refugee 

law and international humanitarian law, while continuing to support legitimate 

counter-terrorism operations against Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also 

known as Da’esh), Al-Qaida and Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (formerly known as the 

Nusrah Front), and all other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated 

with Al-Qaida or ISIL, and other terrorist groups, which have been designated by the 

Security Council, 

 Urging all parties, particularly the Syrian regime, to engage meaningfully in the 

political process under the auspices of the Special Envoy and his office in Geneva, in  

accordance with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), and including the full and 

meaningful participation and representation of women in all efforts and decisions, 

welcoming resumption of the Syrian-led and Syrian-owned constitutional committee 

convened and facilitated by the Special Envoy in Geneva from 24 to 29 August 2020, 

and urging the Syrian parties, particularly the Syrian regime, to engage in a 

constructive and active manner in order to advance the work of the committee in line 

with the agreed terms of reference and rules of procedure, 

 Noting with deep concern the culture of impunity from within the Syrian regime 

for the most serious violations of international law and violations and abuses of 

human rights law committed during the present conflict, some of which rise to the 

level of war crimes and crimes against humanity, which has provided a fertile ground 

for further violations and abuses,  

 Emphasizing the importance of accountability for the most serious crimes in 

violation of international law committed during the conflict for ensuring sustainable 

peace, 

 Recalling that, amid expressions of popular discontent over restrictions on the 

enjoyment of civil, political, economic and social rights, civilian protests erupted in

Dar’a in March 2011, and noting that the violent oppression of civilian protests by 

the Syrian regime, which later escalated to the direct shelling of civilians, fuelled the 

escalation of armed violence and the rise of violent extremist groups and terrorist 

groups, 

 Recalling also all relevant resolutions on the safety and security of humanitar ian 

personnel and the protection of United Nations personnel, including its resolution 

73/137 of 14 December 2018, as well as Security Council resolutions on the 

protection of humanitarian personnel, including resolution 2175 (2014) of 29 August 

2014, the relevant statements by the President of the Security Council referring to the 

specific obligations under international humanitarian law to respect and  protect, in 

situations of armed conflict, all medical personnel and humanitarian workers 

exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means of transport, equipment, hospitals 

and other medical facilities, and to ensure that the wounded and sick receive, t o the 

fullest extent practicable and with the least possible delay, the medical care and 

attention required, and condemning attacks against hospitals and places where the 

sick and wounded are collected, including makeshift hospitals, as well as attacks 

against medical personnel and humanitarian workers that are in violation of 

international humanitarian law,  

 Expressing grave concern at the indiscriminate use of force by the Syrian regime 

against civilians, which has caused immense human suffering and fomen ted the 

spread of violent extremism and violent extremist groups and which demonstrates the 

continuing failure of the Syrian regime to protect the population and implement the 

relevant resolutions and decisions of United Nations bodies and has created a sa fe 

haven and operating environment for war crimes and crimes against humanity,  

 Expressing grave concern also at the remaining presence of violent extremism 

and violent extremist groups, terrorists and terrorist groups, and strongly condemning 

all violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian 

law committed in the Syrian Arab Republic by any party to the conflict, in particular 

ISIL (also known as Da’esh), Al-Qaida-affiliated terrorist groups, armed groups and 

non-state actors, and also the Syrian regime and its allies,  

 Noting with serious concern the findings of the Independent International 

Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic that non-State armed groups still 

resort to the use of force against civilians,  

 Reaffirming its condemnation in the strongest possible terms  of the use of 

chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances, emphasizing that any use of 

chemical weapons anywhere, at any time, by anyone, under any circumstances is 

unacceptable and is and would be a violation of international law, and expressing its 

strong conviction that those individuals responsible for the use of chemical weapons 

must and should be held accountable,  

 Condemning in the strongest possible terms the fact that chemical weapons have 

been used since 2012 in the Syrian Arab Republic, including as reported in April 2020 

by the Investigation and Identification Team of the Organisation for the Prohibition 

of Chemical Weapons, which concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe 

that the Syrian Air Force had carried out three chemical weapons attacks in Ltamenah 

during March 2017, welcoming the decision adopted on 9 July 2020 by the Executive 

Council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, 34 in which the 

Executive Council condemned the use by the Syrian Arab Republic of chemical 

weapons in Ltamenah and requested that the Syrian Arab Republic take steps to 

redress the situation within 90 days, regretting the failure of the Syrian Arab Republic 

to reply to this request, recalling the report of 26 October 2017 of the Organisation

for the use of the chemical weapon sarin on 4 April 2017 in Khan Shaykhun, and the 

report of 24 August 2016 of the Mechanism,36 which concluded that the Syrian Arab 

Armed Forces had been responsible for the attacks that released toxic substances in 

Talmenes in 2014 and in Sarmin and Qmenas in 2015 and that ISIL (also known as 

Da’esh) had used sulfur mustard in Marea in 2015 and in Umm Hawsh in 2016, 

accordingly noting with great concern the reports of the fact-finding mission of the 

Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons regarding incidents in Saraqib, 

and involving alleged use of toxic chemicals as a weapon in Duma, which concluded 

that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the use of a toxic chemical as a 

weapon had taken place, and demanding that the perpetrators immediately desist from 

any further use of chemical weapons,  

 Expressing support for the work carried out by the Independent International 

Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, welcoming its reports, strongly 

condemning the lack of cooperation by the Syrian regime with the Commission of 

Inquiry, reiterating its decision to transmit the reports of the Commission of Inquiry 

to the Security Council, expressing its appreciation to the Commission of Inquiry for 

its briefings to members of the Security Council, and requesting that the Commission 

of Inquiry continue to brief the General Assembly and members of the Security 

Council, 

 Welcoming the reports for 2019 and 2020 of the International, Impartial and 

Independent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation and Prosecution of Persons 

Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law Committed in the 

Syrian Arab Republic since March 201137 and their consideration by the General 

Assembly, noting with serious concern the observation of the Commission of Inquiry 

that, since March 2011, there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Syrian regime 

has conducted widespread and systemic attacks against the civilian population 

amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity, including targeted attacks on 

protected persons and objects, including medical facilities, and personnel and 

transport and blocked humanitarian convoys, as well as enforced disappearances, 

torture in detention, arbitrary detentions, summary executions and other violations 

and abuses, and underscoring the need for those allegations to be examined and 

evidence to be collected and made available for future accountability efforts, 

 Strongly condemning the reported killing of detainees in Syrian military 

intelligence facilities and the widespread practice of enforced disappearance, 

arbitrary detention and the use of sexual and gender-based violence and torture in 

detention centres referred to in the reports of the Commission of Inquiry, including, 

but not limited to, Branch 215, Branch 227, Branch 235, Branch 251, the Air Force 

Intelligence Investigation Branch at Mazzah military airport and Saydnaya prison, 

including the practice of mass hangings by the regime, as well as the killing of 

detainees at military hospitals, including Tishrin and Harasta hospitals,  

 Recalling the statements made by the Secretary-General, the United Nations 

High Commissioner for Human Rights and the special procedures of the Human 

Rights Council that crimes against humanity and war crimes are likely to have been 

committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, noting the repeated encouragement by the 

High Commissioner for the Security Council to refer the situation to the International

Criminal Court, and regretting that a draft resolution 38 was not adopted 

notwithstanding broad support from Member States,  

 Recalling also the report of 6 April 2020 of the United Nations Board of 

Inquiry39 into strikes that damaged and destroyed health-care facilities in the north-

west of the Syrian Arab Republic, including sites whose coordinates had been 

recorded on the United Nations deconfliction list as a step to ensure that they would 

not be targeted or impacted by violence, and which in most instances examined, 

concluded that it was “highly probable that the strikes had been carried out by the 

Government of the Syrian Arab Republic and/or its allies” and found that health -care 

services were being provided at the time of some of the strikes and that there were no 

armed opposition groups in or near the facilities, and calling on all parties to adhere 

to and comply with the deconfliction mechanism,  

 Calling for the immediate repeal of Law No. 10/2018, concerned about the 

Syrian regime’s infringement on the housing, land and property of Syrians, 

particularly through the dispossession of displaced Syrians’ land and property in the 

national legislation and similar measures, which would have a significant detrimental 

impact on the rights of Syrians displaced by the conflict to claim their property and 

to return to their homes in a safe, voluntary and dignified manner when the situation 

on the ground allows it, and expressing concern about reports of armed groups’ abuses 

of Syrians’ housing, land and property rights in areas under their control,  

 Deploring in this regard the existence and application of national legislation, in 

particular Law No. 42/2018 and other legislation and practices concerning housing, 

land and property rights, which have a significant detrimental impact on the rights of 

Syrians displaced by the conflict to claim their property, as evidenced by continuing 

reports of widespread demolition of property in areas former ly controlled by the 

Syrian opposition as well as the confiscation of property owned by arbitrarily detained 

and missing persons throughout the Syrian Arab Republic, calling for the immediate 

repeal of that legislation, and stressing the right of everyone,  including displaced 

Syrians, to not be arbitrarily deprived of their property and that they should be able 

to return to their homes in a safe, voluntary and dignified manner when the situation 

on the ground allows it, 

 Expressing concern that the implementation of Security Council resolutions 

2139 (2014), 2165 (2014), 2191 (2014), 2254 (2015), 2258 (2015), 2268 (2016), 2286 

(2016), 2393 (2017), 2401 (2018), 2449 (2018), 2504 (2020) and 2533(2020) remains 

unresolved, and noting the urgent need to strengthen efforts to address the 

humanitarian situation in the Syrian Arab Republic, including through protection of 

civilians and safe, full, immediate, unimpeded and sustained humanitarian access 

throughout the Syrian Arab Republic,  

 Emphasizing that the humanitarian cross-border mechanism remains an 

essential and life-saving channel to address the humanitarian needs of a significant 

portion of the population of the Syrian Arab Republic, which cannot be reached 

through existing operations within the Syrian Arab Republic, and emphasizing also 

that an immediate and significant improvement to cross-line access and respect for 

principled humanitarian action are essential to prevent further unnecessary suffering 

and loss of life, 

 Expressing grave concern at the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 

pandemic and about United Nations reports on rising numbers of death notices and 

burials which seem to indicate that actual COVID-19 cases in the Syrian Arab 

Republic far exceed official figures, recognizing that the pandemic presents a

profound challenge to the decimated health system, socioeconomic and humanitarian 

situations of the Syrian Arab Republic, underlining that the grave risk posed by 

COVID-19 heightens the imperative of using every possible means, including the 

cross-border mechanism, to reach people in need without preconditions and 

discrimination, calling for the provision of humanitarian assistance to all parts of the 

Syrian Arab Republic, including in areas where humanitarian needs are especially 

urgent, and stressing the importance of accurate and timely data collection and 

reporting, 

 Recalling its commitment to Security Council resolutions 2170 (2014), 2178 

(2014), and 2253 (2015) of 17 December 2015, 

 Alarmed that more than 5.5 million refugees, including more than 3.8 million 

women and children, have been forced to flee the Syrian Arab Republic and that 

11.1 million people in the Syrian Arab Republic, of whom 5.9 million are internally 

displaced, require urgent humanitarian assistance, which has resulted in an influx of 

Syrian refugees into neighbouring countries, other countries in the region and beyond, 

and alarmed at the risk the situation presents to regional and international stability,  

 Expressing its profound indignation at the death of more than 17,000 children 

and the many more injured since the beginning of the peaceful protests in March 2011, 

and at all violations and abuses committed against children in contravention of 

applicable international law, including those involving their recruitment and use, 

abduction, killing and maiming and rape and other forms of sexual violence, attacks 

on schools and hospitals, and denial of humanitarian access, as well as their arbitrary 

arrest, detention, torture and ill-treatment and their use as human shields, and noting 

in this regard the adoption on 18 July 2019 of the Security Council Working Group 

on Children and Armed Conflict conclusions on children and armed conflict in the 

Syrian Arab Republic40 as well as the report of 13 January 2020 of the Independent 

International Commission of Inquiry entitled “They have erased the dreams of my 

children: children’s rights in the Syrian Arab Republic”, and emphasizing that the 

Syrian regime and its allies must comply with their applicable international law 

obligations that are relevant to children, including under the Convention on the Rights 

of the Child and the Protocols thereto,  

 Noting with concern that the Hawl camp currently hosts over 64,000 people, 

92 per cent of whom are women and children, including some 35,000 children under 

12 years of age who live under extremely challenging conditions,  

 Recalling with serious concern the findings of the Commission of Inquiry in its 

report entitled “Out of sight, out of mind: deaths in detention  in the Syrian Arab 

Republic”, noting in this regard the issuing of death notifications of detained 

individuals by the Syrian regime, which provides further indication of systematic 

violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, as 

well as the Commission’s reporting in March 2019 on the scope and scale of arbitrary 

arrests and detention used by government forces as tools of repression that have led 

to the custodial deaths of tens of thousands of Syrian civilians and its reporting that 

the deaths of thousands of individuals previously detained in Hama, Ladhiqiyah, 

Hasakah and Damascus have been confirmed by Syrian regime entities th rough 

certificates of death, and findings of the Commission in its report of March 2018 

entitled “Detention in the Syrian Arab Republic: a way forward”, noting that the 

whereabouts of tens of thousands of detainees remains unknown and unacknowledged 

by the Syrian regime, recalling chilling accounts of torture, neglect and inhumane 

conditions, which the Commission meticulously documented and described as 

amounting to crimes against humanity, of extermination, murder, rape or other forms

achieving a political solution to the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, and to bring 

to an end the systematic, widespread and gross violations and abuses of human righ ts 

and violations of international humanitarian law,  

 1. Strongly condemns the systematic, widespread and gross violations and 

abuses of international human rights law and violations of international humanitarian 

law committed in the Syrian Arab Republic and the indiscriminate and 

disproportionate attacks against the civilian population and against civilian

violence by the Syrian regime against the Syrian people since the beginning of the 

peaceful protests in 2011, and demands that the Syrian regime immediately put an 

end to all attacks against civilians, take all feasible precautions to avoid, and in any

to lead to the release of those arbitrarily detained and ensure the assessment of the 

number of people who remain in prisons, consistent with Security Council resolution 

2254 (2015), as only a durable and inclusive political solution to the conflict can bring 

an end to the systematic, widespread and gross violations and abuses of int ernational 

human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law;

that the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer or use 

of chemical weapons anywhere, at any time, by anyone, under any ci rcumstances, is 

unacceptable, constitutes one of the most serious crimes under international law, and 

is a violation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, 

Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction 42 and Security 

Council resolution 2118 (2013), and expresses its strong conviction that individuals

chlorine attack on 4 February 2018 in Saraqib, the attack on 7 April 2018 in Duma

Council resolution 2118 (2013), in which the Council decided that the Syrian Arab 

Republic shall not use, develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile or retain 

chemical weapons, or transfer, directly or indirectly, chemical weapons to other States 

or non-State actors, recalls the relevant reports of the Investigation and Identification

Syrian Arab Republic, including forced displacement of civilians as a result of local

relevant provisions of international human rights law and international humanitarian 

law, promote non-discriminatory access to health services and respect and protect the

and physical attacks, and notes with concern about the limited access to health-care

predominantly air-to-ground missiles and barrel bombs launched in south-eastern 

Idlib and western Aleppo between 1 November 2019 and 5 March 2020, which 

damaged medical facilities, schools and markets and killed civilians, and notes 

“reasonable grounds to believe that pro-government forces committed the war crimes 

of deliberately attacking medical personnel and facilities by conducting airstrikes”, 

as well as “the war crime of launching indiscriminate attacks resulting in death or 

injury to civilians”, causing the displacement of over 560,000 people from the north -

west of Idlib, in addition to the previous displacement of more than half of the

and civilian objects, further demands that all parties to the conflict take all appropr iate 

steps to protect civilians, in compliance with international law, including by desisting 

from attacks directed against civilian objects, such as medical centres, schools and 

water stations, and refrain from militarizing such facilities, seek to avoid establishing 

military positions in densely populated areas and enable the evacuation of the

areas, and recalls in this regard that the Syrian regime bears primary responsibil ity 

for protecting its population; 

 34. Condemns in the strongest terms all attacks on protected objects, including 

indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks and those which may constitute a war 

crime, taking place in the Syrian Arab Republic, and requests the Commission of 

Inquiry to continue to investigate all such acts, and demands that the Syrian regime 

meet its responsibility to protect the Syrian population;  

 35. Demands that the Syrian regime immediately cease any attacks on 

civilians, any disproportionate attacks and any indiscriminate use of weapons in 

populated areas, and recalls in this regard the obligation to respect international 

humanitarian law in all circumstances;  

 36. Emphasizes the need for accountability for crimes involving breaches of 

international law, in particular of international humanitarian law and human rights 

law, some of which may constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity, committed

investigations and prosecutions at the domestic or international level;

to account through appropriate, fair and independent domestic or international 

criminal justice mechanisms, stresses the need to pursue practical steps towards this 

goal, and for that reason encourages the Security Council to take appropriate action 

to ensure accountability, noting the important role that the International Criminal

Republic and to prosecute crimes within their jurisdiction committed in the Syrian

information between States in accordance with their national legislation and 

international law, and also encourages other States to consider doing the same;

place measures and policies to assist and host Syrian refugees, encourages them to do 

more, also encourages other States outside the region to consider implementing

informed and dignified manner to their place of origin or another location of their 

choice; 

 44. Strongly condemns the intentional denial of humanitarian assistance to 

civilians, from whatever quarter, and in particular the denial of medical assistance

of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic in this regard;

about those still in detention as well as those who died while in detention by the 

Syrian regime, returning their remains, with full transparency regard ing what 

happened to these individuals, and urges the regime to immediately reverse its

access to detainees in all prisons and detention centres, including all military facilities 

referred to in the reports of the Commission of Inquiry; 

 50. Demands in this respect the immediate release of all persons arbitrarily or 

unlawfully detained by the Syrian regime, notes in particular the additional life-

threatening risks to health created by the COVID-19 pandemic and the high risks that

military offensive, and remains extremely concerned about the situation;  

 54. Notes with concern the continued insecurity in the north-east of the Syrian 

Arab Republic and the restricted humanitarian space following the failure to 

reauthorize the Ya‘rubiyah border crossing, in Security Council resolutions 2504 

(2020) and 2533 (2020), further compounded by lack of access to water and 

electricity, which continues to undermine the stability and security of the whole

 57. Urges all parties to the conflict to take all appropriate steps to ensure the 

safety and security of United Nations and associated personnel, personnel of the

humanitarian law, without prejudice to their freedom of movement and access, stresses 

the need not to impede or hinder these efforts, recalls that attacks on humanitarian 

workers may amount to war crimes, and notes in this regard that the Security Council

based on the final communiqué of the Action Group for Syria of 30 June 2012, 

consistent with Security Council resolutions 2254 (2015) and 2268 (2016), that meets

State, with the full and effective participation of women, where there is no room for 

sectarianism or discrimination on ethnic, religious, linguistic, gender or any other 

grounds, and where all persons receive equal protection, regardless of gender, religion 

or ethnicity, and further demands that all parties work urgently towards the
