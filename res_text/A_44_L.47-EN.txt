Reaffirming the need for continued collective support for the decisions
adopted by the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference, held at Fez, Morocco, on
25 November 1981 and from 6 to 9 September 1982, ~I which were confirmed by
subsequent Arab summit conferences, including the Extraordinary Arab Summit
Conference held at Casablanca, Morocco, from 23 to 26 May 1989, reiterating its
previous resolution on the question of Palestine and its support for the Palestine
Liberation Organization as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian
people, and consideri~g that the convening of the International Peace Conference on
the Middle East, under the auspices of the United Nations, in accordance with
General Assembly resolution 38/58 C and other relevant resolutions related to the
question of Palestine, would contribute to the promotion of peace in the region,

Welcoming all efforts contributing towards the realization of the inalienable
rights of the Palestinian people through the achievement of a comprehensive, just
and lasting peace in the Middle East, in accordance with the United Nations
resolutions relating to the question of Palestine and to the situation in the
Middle East,

Welcoming the world-wide support extended to the just cause of the Palestinian
people and the other Arab countries in their struggle against Israeli aggression
and occupation in order to achieve a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the
Middle East and the full exercise by the Palestinian people of its inalienable
national rights, as affirmed by previous resolutions of the General Assembly on the
question of Palestine and on the situation in the Middl~ East,

Grayely concerned that the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967,
including Jerusalem, and the other occupied Arab territ~ries still remain under
Israeli occupation, that the relevant resolutions of the United Nations have not
been implemented and that the Palestinian people is still denied the restoration of
its land and the exercise of its inalienable national rights in conformity with
international law, as reaffirmed by resolutions of the United Nations,

Reaffirming the applicability of the Geneva Convention relative to the
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of·12 August 1949 .. .al to the
Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem, and the other
occupied Arab territories,

Reaffirming also all relevant United Nations resolutions which stipulate that
the acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible under the Charter of the
United Nations and the principles of international law and that Israel must
withdraw unconditionally from the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967,
including Jerusalem, and the other occupied Arab territories,

Reaffirming further the imperative necessity of establishing a comprehensive,
just and lasting peace in the region, based on full respect for the Charter and the
principles of international law,

Gravely concerned also at the continuing Israeli policies involving the
escalation and expansion of the conflict in the region, which further violate the
principles of international law and endanger international peace and security,

to achieve an early comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East,

the conflict in the Middle East and that no comprehensive, just and lasting peace

withdrawal of Israel from the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including
Jerusalem, and the other occupied Arab territories;

be based on a comprehensive, just and lasting solution of the Middle East problem,
under the auspices of the United Nations and on the basis of ~ts relevant
resolutions, which ensures the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from
the Palestinian territory occupiea since 1967, including Jerusalem, and the other
occupied Arab territories, and which enables the Palestinian people, under the
leagership of the.Palestine Liberation Organization, to exercise its inalienable
rights, includ;,ng the right to return and the right to self-determination, national
independence and the establishment of its independent sovereign State in Palestine,
in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations relating to the question
of Palestin~, in particular General Assembly resolutions ES-7/2 of 29 July 1980,
36/120 A to F of 10 December 01981, 37/86 A to D of 10 December 1982, 37/86 E of

including the Extraordinary Arab Summit Conference, held at Casablanca, Morocco,
from 23 to 26 May 1989, as well as relevant efforts and action to implement the Fez

5. Condemns Israel's continued occupation of the Palestinian territory
occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem, and the other occupied Arab territories,

law and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations, and demands the immediate,
unconditional and total withdrawal of Israel from all the territories occupi~d
since 1967;

6. Rejects all agreements and arrangements which violate the inalienable
rights of the Palestinian people and conrradict the principles of a just and
comprehensive solution to the Middle East problem to ensure the establishment of a

7. Deplores Israel's failure to comply with Security Council resolutions
476 (1980) of 30 June 1980 and 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980 and General Assembly
resolutions 35/207 of 16 December 1980 and 36/226 A and B of 17 December 1981;
determines that Israel's decision to annex Jerusalem and to declare it as its
"capital" as well as the measures to alter its physical character, demographic
composition, institutional structure and status are null and void and demands that
they be rescinded immediately; and calls upon all Member States, the specialized
agencies and all other international organizations to abide by the present
resolution and all ~the~ relevant resolutions and decisions;

8. Condemns Israel's aggression, policies and practices against the

Charter and the principles of international law and the relevant international
conventions;

9. Strongly condemns the imposition by Israel of its laws, jurisciction and
administration on the occupied Syrian Arab Golan, its annexationist polici~s and
practices, the establishment of settlements, the confiscation of lands, the
diversion of water resources and the imposition of Israeli citizenship on Syrian
nationals, and declares that all these measures are null and void and constitute a
violation of the rules and principles of intarnational law relative to belligerent
occupation, in particular the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of
Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949;

10. Considers that the agreements on strategic co-operation between the
United States of America and Israel, signed on 30 November 1981, and the continued
supply of modern arms and materie1 to Israel, augmented by substantial economic
aid, including the Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between the
two Governments, have encouraged Israel to pursue its aggressive and expansionist
policies and practices in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including
Jerusalem, and the other occupied Arab territories, and have had adverse effects on
efforts for the establishment of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the
Middle East and pose a threat to the security of the region;

Arab countries and the Palestinian people;

12. Strongly condemns the continuing and increasing collaboration between
Israel and the racist regime of South Africa, especially in the economic, military

States and enables Israel to enhance its nuclear capabilities, thus subjecting the
States of the region to nuclear blackmail;

the Middle East, under the auspices of the United Nations, with the participation
