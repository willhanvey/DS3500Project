would offer an opportunity to review, from a perspective more in tune with the 
current international situation, the most critical aspects of the process of 
disarmament and to mobilize the international community and public opinion in 
favour of the elimination of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and of 
the control and reduction of conventional weapons, 

 Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration, adopted by the Heads of 
State and Government during the United Nations Millennium Summit, held in New 
York from 6 to 8 September 2000,2 in which they resolved “to strive for the 
elimination of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, and to 
keep all options open for achieving this aim, including the possibility of convening 
an international conference to identify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers”, 

 Reiterating its conviction that a special session of the General Assembly 
devoted to disarmament can set the future course of action in the fields of 
disarmament, arms control, non-proliferation and related international security 
matters, 

 Emphasizing the importance of multilateralism in the process of disarmament, 
arms control, non-proliferation and related international security matters,

objectives and agenda, including the possible establishment of the preparatory 
committee, for the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to

of consensus, to consider the objectives and agenda, including the possible 
establishment of the preparatory committee, for the fourth special session of the 
General Assembly devoted to disarmament, taking note of the paper presented by 
the Chairman of Working Group II during the 1999 substantive session of the 
Disarmament Commission4 and the written proposals and views submitted by 
Member States as contained in the working papers presented during the three 
substantive sessions of the Open-ended Working Group in 20035 as well as the 
reports of the Secretary-General regarding the views of Member States on the 
objectives, agenda and timing of the fourth special session of the General Assembly 
devoted to disarmament;6 

 2. Requests the Open-ended Working Group to hold an organizational 
session in order to set the date for its substantive sessions in 2007 and to submit a 
report on its work, including possible substantive recommendations, before the end 
of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly; 

 3. Requests the Secretary-General, within existing resources, to provide the 
Open-ended Working Group with the necessary assistance and services as may be 
required to discharge its tasks;
