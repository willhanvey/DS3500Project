territorial integrity of Sudan, and to the cause of peace, and expressing its 
determination to work with the Government of Sudan, in full respect of its 
sovereignty, to assist in tackling the various problems in Darfur, Sudan, 

 Recalling the conclusions of the Addis Ababa high-level consultation on the 
situation in Darfur of 16 November 2006 as endorsed in the communiqué of the 
66th meeting of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union held in Abuja 
on 30 November 2006 as well as the communiqué of 79th meeting of the Peace and 
Security Council of the African Union on 22 June 2007, recalling the statement of 
its President of 19 December 2006 endorsing the Addis Ababa and Abuja 
agreements, welcoming the progress made so far and calling for them to be fully 
implemented by all parties without delay and for all parties to facilitate the 
immediate deployment of the United Nations Light and Heavy Support packages to 
the African Union Mission in the Sudan (AMIS) and a Hybrid operation in Darfur, 
for which back-stopping and command and control structures will be provided by 
the United Nations, and recalling that co-operation between the UN and the regional 
arrangements in matters relating to the maintenance of peace and security is an 
integral part of collective security as provided for in the Charter of the United 
Nations,  

 Re-affirming also its previous resolutions 1325 (2000) on women, peace and 
security, 1502 (2003) on the protection of humanitarian and United Nations 
personnel, 1612 (2005) on children and armed conflict and the subsequent

pertaining to parties to the armed conflict in Sudan (S/2006/971), and 1674 (2006) 
on the protection of civilians in armed conflict, as well as recalling the report of its

consultations with the Government of Sudan in Addis Ababa on 12 June 2007 and 
confirmed in full during the Council’s meeting with the President of Sudan on 
17 June in Khartoum,  

 Recalling the Addis Ababa Agreement that the Hybrid operation should have a 
predominantly African character and the troops should, as far as possible, be 
sourced from African countries, 

 Commending the efforts of the African Union for the successful deployment of 
AMIS, as well as the efforts of member states and regional organisations that have 
assisted it in its deployment, stressing the need for AMIS, as supported by the 
United Nations Light and Heavy Support Packages, to assist implementation of the 
Darfur Peace Agreement until the end of its mandate, calling upon the Government 
of Sudan to assist in removing all obstacles to the proper discharge by AMIS of its 
mandate; and recalling the communiqué of the 79th meeting of the Peace and 
Security Council of the African Union of 22 June to extend the mandate of AMIS 
for an additional period not exceeding six months until 31 December 2007, 

 Stressing the urgent need to mobilise the financial, logistical and other support 
and assistance required for AMIS, 

 Welcoming the ongoing preparations for the Hybrid operation, including the 
putting in place of logistical arrangements in Darfur, at United Nations 
Headquarters and the African Union Commission Headquarters, force and police 
generation efforts and on-going joint efforts by the Secretary General and the 
Chairperson of the African Union to finalise essential operational policies, and 
further welcoming action taken so that appropriate financial and administrative 
mechanisms are established to ensure the effective management of the Hybrid, 

 Re-iterating its belief in the basis provided by the Darfur Peace Agreement for 
a lasting political solution and sustained security in Darfur, deploring that the 
Agreement has not been fully implemented by the signatories and not signed by all 
parties to the conflict in Darfur, calling for an immediate cease-fire, urging all 
parties not to act in any way that would impede the implementation of the 
Agreement, and recalling the communiqué of the second international meeting on 
the situation in Darfur convened by the African Union and United Nations Special 
Envoys in Tripoli from 15-16 July 2007, 

 Noting with strong concern on-going attacks on the civilian population and 
humanitarian workers and continued and widespread sexual violence, including as 
outlined in the Report of the Secretary-General and the Chairperson of the African 
Union Commission on the Hybrid Operation in Darfur and the report of the 
Secretary-General of 23 February 2007, emphasising the need to bring to justice the 
perpetrators of such crimes and urging the Government of Sudan to do so, and 
reiterating in this regard its condemnation of all violations of human rights and 
international humanitarian law in Darfur, 

 Reiterating its deep concern for the security of humanitarian aid workers and 
their access to populations in need, condemning those parties to the conflict who 
have failed to ensure the full, safe and unhindered access of relief personnel to all 
those in need in Darfur as well as the delivery of humanitarian assistance, in 
particular to internally displaced persons and refugees, and recognising that, with 
many citizens in Darfur having been displaced, humanitarian efforts remain a 
priority until a sustained cease-fire and inclusive political process are achieved,
