Aware of the importance attached by the countries of origin to the return
of cultural property which is of fundamental spiritual and cultural value to
them, so that they may constitute collections representative of their cultural
heritage,

1. Commends the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization and the Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of
Cultural Property to Its Countries of Origin or Its Restitution in Case of
Illicit Appropriation on the work they have accomplished, in particular through
the promotion of bilateral negotiations, for the return or restitution of
cultural property, the preparation of inventories of movable cultural property,
the reduction of illicit traffic in cultural property and the dissemination of
information to the public;

2. Reaffirms that the restitution to a country of its objets d'art,
monuments, museum pieces, archives, manuscripts, documents and any other
cultural or artistic treasures contributes to the strengthening of international
cooperation and to the preservation and flowering of universal cultural values
through fruitful cooperation between developed and developing countries;

3. Requests the Secretary-General, in collaboration with the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, to continue to
develop all possibilities for bringing about the attainment of the objectives of
resolution 48/15 of 29 October 1993;
