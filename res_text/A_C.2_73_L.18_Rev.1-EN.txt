 The General Assembly, 

 Reaffirming its resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming 

our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, in which it adopted a 

comprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative 

Sustainable Development Goals and targets, its commitment to working tirelessly f or 

the full implementation of the Agenda by 2030, its recognition that eradicating 

poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest 

global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, its 

commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions —

instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, where appropriate, as 

soon as possible,  

 Reaffirming the New Urban Agenda, adopted at the United Nations Conference 

on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III), held in Quito from 

17 to 20 October 2016,3 

 Recalling its resolution 72/233 of 20 December 2017, in which it considered 

that the theme of the Third United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty 

(2018–2027) should be “Accelerating global actions for a world without poverty”, 

and all other resolutions related to the eradication of poverty,  

 Noting with appreciation the aspirations, embedded in Agenda 2063 of the 

African Union, to lift huge sections of the population out of poverty, improve incomes 

and catalyse economic and social transformation, and recognizing the importance of 

the international community to help African countries to achieve such goals, 

especially in the rural areas of the African continent,  

 Recalling its declaration, in resolution 47/196 of 22 December 1992, of 

17 October as the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty,  

 Noting that, while considerable progress has been made over the past decade 

across all areas of development, the pace of progress observed in recent years is 

insufficient and uneven to fully meet the Sustainable Development Goals and targets 

by 2030, especially in the area of rural poverty eradication,  

 Reaffirming that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including 

extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge facing the world today and an 

indispensable requirement for sustainable development, particularly in Africa, in the 

least developed countries, in small island developing States and in some middle -

income countries, and underlining the importance of accelerating sustainable, 

inclusive and equitable economic growth and sustainable development, including full, 

productive employment and decent work for all, with a view to reducing inequalities 

within and among countries,  

 Recognizing that poverty is a serious impediment to the achievement of gender 

equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, including those living in rural 

areas, and that the feminization of poverty persists, emphasizing that the eradication 

of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is an 

indispensable requirement for sustainable development, acknowledging the mutually 

reinforcing links between the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment 

of all women and girls and the eradication of poverty, and stressing the importance of 

support for countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty in all its forms and 

dimensions,  

 Emphasizing that the implementation of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

Development depends crucially on the transformation of rural areas, where most of 

the poor and hungry live,  

 Welcoming the proclamation of 2019–2028 as the United Nations Decade of 

Family Farming, to raise the profile of the role of family farming 4 in contributing to 

the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,  

 Recognizing the interlinkages and integrated nature of the Sustainable 

Development Goals, and reiterating that the eradication of rural poverty and hunger 

is crucial for the achievement of internationally agreed development goals, including 

those contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and that rural

development should be pursued through an integrated approach which encompasses 

economic, social and environmental dimensions, takes into account a gender 

perspective and consists of mutually reinforcing policies and programmes, and which 

should be balanced, targeted, situation specific, locally owned, include local 

synergies and initiatives and be responsive to the needs of rural populations,  

 Recalling that nearly 80 per cent of the extreme poor live in rural areas and work 

in agriculture, and that devoting resources to the development of rural areas and 

sustainable agriculture and supporting smallholder farmers, especially women 

farmers, is key to ending poverty in all its forms and dimensions, by, inter alia, 

improving the welfare of farmers,  

 Expressing its concern that the extreme poor have limited access to productive 

resources, basic health, education and social protection services, basic infrastructure 

such as roads, water and electricity, and off-farm employment opportunities, and are 

susceptible to the impacts of natural disasters, especially weather-related hazards, 

including the El Niño phenomenon, and the adverse effects of climate change, and  

that rural women and girls fare far worse on most development indicators,  

 Emphasizing the importance of enhancing global support for national work on 

rural development policies and strategies,  

 1. Reaffirms that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, 

including extreme poverty, for all people everywhere, is the greatest global challenge 

and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, as well as an 

overarching objective of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 5 of which 

the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing 

for Development6 is an integral part, supporting and complementing it;  

 2. Welcomes the remarkable progress made since 1990, which has lifted over 

1.1 billion people out of extreme poverty, but also expresses its deep concern that the 

progress in reducing poverty remains uneven, with 1.46 billion people still living in 

multidimensional poverty, and that this number continues to be significant and 

unacceptably high, whereas the levels of inequality in income, wealth and 

opportunities remain high or are increasing in a number of countries, and the 

non-income dimensions of poverty and deprivation, such as access to quality 

education or basic health services, and relative poverty remain major concerns;  

 3. Recognizes the importance of promoting socioeconomic development in 

rural areas as an effective strategy at the global level for the eradication of poverty, 

including extreme poverty, and therefore underlines the importance of shaping a rural 

poverty eradication pattern with the concerted efforts of the whole of society to 

promote socioeconomic development in rural areas;  

 4. Also recognizes the critical role and contribution of rural women, 

including smallholders and women farmers, and indigenous women and women in 

local communities, and their traditional knowledge in enhancing agricultural and rural 

development, improving food security and eradicating rural poverty;  

 5. Stresses the importance of taking targeted measures to eradicate poverty 

in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, by formulating rural 

development strategies with clear poverty eradication goals, strengthening national 

statistical capacity and monitoring systems and implementing nationally appropriate 

social protection systems and measures for all;

 6. Recognizes the importance of employment for pro-poor growth in rural 

areas, and encourages the United Nations system and development partners to assist 

countries, upon their request, in mainstreaming employment into investment policy 

and poverty reduction strategies, including those focused on rural area development, 

and fostering rapid agricultural productivity growth, especially in developing 

countries, by increasing investment in agricultural and related rural off-farm 

activities; 

 7. Also recognizes the need to design, implement and pursue gender-

responsive economic and social policies aimed at, inter alia, eradicating poverty, 

including in rural areas, and combating the feminization of poverty,  ensuring the full 

and equal participation of rural women in the development, implementation and 

follow-up of development policies and programmes and poverty eradication 

strategies, supporting increased rural employment and decent work, and promoting 

the participation of women at all levels and sectors of the rural economy and in 

diverse on-farm and off-farm economic activities, including sustainable agricultural 

and fisheries production;  

 8. Emphasizes that globally, 2 billion people, primarily in rural areas in 

developing countries, do not have access to formal financial services, and encourages 

further efforts of international community to offer affordable ways to access finance 

for the financially excluded in rural areas;  

 9. Also emphasizes the need to increase investment, including through 

enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, especially in roads, water, 

sanitation and electricity; 

 10. Expresses its commitment to raising public awareness to promote the 

eradication of poverty and extreme poverty in all countries, to mobilizing the 

enthusiasm and creativity of all stakeholders, especially the rural residents living in 

extreme poverty, to fight against poverty, to promoting their active participation in 

the design and implementation of programmes and policies which affect them, and to 

providing quality education for the rural poor, with the aim of achieving the 2030 

Agenda for Sustainable Development;  

 11. Stresses the need to enhance and expand access by developing countries 

to appropriate technologies that are pro-poor and raise productivity, and underlines 

the need for measures to increase investment in agriculture, including modern 

technologies, as well as in natural resources management and capacity-building of the 

developing countries;  

 12. Also stresses that the achievement of sustainable development and the 

eradication of poverty also hinge on the ability and readiness of countries to 

effectively mobilize domestic resources, attract foreign direct investment, fulfil 

official development assistance commitments and use official development assistance 

effectively, and facilitate the transfer of technology to developing countries, on 

mutually agreed terms, and further stresses that the resolution of unsustainable debt 

situations is critical for heavily indebted poor countries, while remittances have 

become a significant source of income and finance for receiving economies and their 

contribution to the achievement of sustainable development;  

 13. Recognizes the importance of addressing the diverse needs of and 

challenges faced by countries in special situations, in particular African countries, the 

least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island 

developing States, as well as the specific challenges facing many middle-income 

countries, and therefore requests the United Nations development system, the 

international financial institutions, regional organizations and other stakeholders to 

ensure that these diverse and specific development needs are appropriately considered 



 
A/C.2/73/L.18/Rev.1 

 

5/5 18-20126 

 

and addressed, in a tailored fashion, in their relevant strategies and policies, with a 

view to promoting a coherent and comprehensive approach towards individual 

countries;  

 14. Realizes that bridging the digital divide will require strong commitment 

by all relevant stakeholders at the national and international levels, and encourages 

efforts by all relevant stakeholders, especially United Nations agencies, funds and 

programmes, in the spirit of win-win cooperation, to assist developing countries in 

overcoming the digital divide and promoting the use of information and 

communication technologies to foster economic and social development, particularly 

in rural areas, with the aim of building a shared future for humankind;  

 15. Recognizes the devastating impact of diseases on societies, and calls for 

measures by relevant United Nations bodies, in accordance with their respective 

mandates, and other stakeholders to make good use of their experience and 

advantages to further help developing countries with the aim of improving rural 

development planning, including poverty eradication and multisectoral development 

activities covering economic and social aspects, including the gender perspective;  

 16. Reiterates the urgent need to accelerate the pace of rural poverty 

eradication, and requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at 

its seventy-fourth session a report on the status of the implementation of and follow-

up to the present resolution in order to identify the gaps and challenges faced in rural 

poverty eradication, especially in developing countries;  

 17. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-fourth session, 

under the item entitled “Eradication of poverty and other development issues”, a 

sub-item entitled “Eradicating rural poverty to implement the 2030 Agenda for 

Sustainable Development”.
