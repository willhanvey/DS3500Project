Fifty-eighth session
First Committee
Agenda item 73 (d)
General and complete disarmament: towards a
nuclear-weapon-free world: the need for a new agenda

Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden:
revised draft resolution

Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: a new agenda

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolutions 53/77 Y of 4 December 1998, 54/54 G of 1 December
1999, 55/33 C of 20 November 2000 and 57/59 of 22 November 2002,

Convinced that the existence of nuclear weapons is a threat to the survival of
humanity and that the only real guarantee against the use or threat of use of these
weapons is their complete elimination and the assurance that they will never be used
or produced again,

Convinced also that the retention of nuclear weapons carries the inherent risk
of proliferation and falling into the hands of non-State actors,

Reaffirming that nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament are equally
important and mutually reinforcing processes requiring continuous irreversible
progress on both fronts,

Declaring that the participation of the international community as a whole is
central to the maintenance and enhancement of international peace and stability and
that international security is a collective concern requiring collective engagement,

Declaring also that internationally negotiated treaties in the field of
disarmament have made a fundamental contribution to international peace and
security and that unilateral and bilateral nuclear disarmament measures complement
the treaty-based multilateral approach towards nuclear disarmament,

Noting the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice on the
Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, issued at The Hague on 8 July
1996,1

A/C.1/58/L.40/Rev.1

Declaring that any presumption of the indefinite possession of nuclear
weapons by the nuclear-weapon States is incompatible with the integrity and
sustainability of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and with the broader goal of
the maintenance of international peace and security,

Declaring that each article of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons2 is binding on the States parties at all times and in all circumstances and
that it is imperative that all States parties be held fully accountable with respect to
the strict compliance with their obligations under the Treaty, and that the
undertakings therein on nuclear disarmament have been given and implementation
of them remains imperative,

Expressing its deep concern at the limited progress made to date in
implementing the thirteen steps on nuclear disarmament, and determined to
implement these thirteen practical steps, to which all States parties agreed at the
2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons,3

Expressing its deep concern at the continued failure of the Conference on
Disarmament to deal with nuclear disarmament and to resume negotiations on a non-
discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty
banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other devices,
taking into consideration both nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation
objectives,

Expressing grave concern that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty4
has not yet entered into force,

Stressing the importance of regular reporting in promoting confidence in the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,

Noting the successful completion in September 2002 of the first phase of the
Trilateral Initiative, involving the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Russian
Federation and the United States of America, which aims to enable the placement of
excess nuclear materials from dismantled weapons under international safeguards,

Convinced that the further reduction of non-strategic nuclear weapons
constitutes an integral part of the nuclear arms reduction and disarmament process,

Noting that, despite bilateral agreements, there is no sign of engagement of all
of the five nuclear-weapon States in the multilateral process leading to the total
elimination of nuclear weapons,

Declaring that it is essential that the fundamental principles of transparency,
verification and irreversibility apply to all nuclear disarmament measures,

Expressing its deep concern at the continued retention of the nuclear-weapon
option by those three States, India, Israel and Pakistan, that have not yet acceded to
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and that operate
unsafeguarded nuclear facilities, in particular given the effects of regional volatility

on international security, and, in this context, the continued regional tensions and
deteriorating security situation in South Asia and the Middle East,

Expressing also its deep concern at the announcement by the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea to withdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons and at its decision to restart the Yongbyon nuclear reactor without
International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards,

Expressing concern that the development of missile defences could impact
negatively on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and lead to a new arms
race on earth and in outer space,

Stressing that no actions be taken that would lead to the weaponization of outer
space,

Expressing its deep concern about emerging approaches to the broader role of
nuclear weapons as part of security strategies, including rationalizations for the use,
and the possible development, of new types of nuclear weapons,

Welcoming further the progress in the development of nuclear-weapon-free
zones,

Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration,5 in which the heads of
State and Government resolved to strive for the elimination of weapons of mass
destruction, in particular nuclear weapons, and to keep all options open for
achieving this aim, including the possibility of convening an international
conference to identify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers,

Taking into consideration the unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon
States, in the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to accomplish the total
elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament, to which all the
States parties to the Treaty are committed under article VI of the Treaty,6

1. Reaffirms that any possibility that nuclear weapons could be used
represents a continued risk for humanity;

2. Calls upon all States to refrain from any action that could lead to a new
nuclear-arms race or that could impact negatively on nuclear disarmament and non-
proliferation;

3. Calls upon all States to fulfil all their obligations under international
treaties and international law in the field of nuclear disarmament and non-
proliferation;

4. Calls upon all States parties to pursue, with determination, the full and
effective implementation of the agreements reached at the 2000 Review Conference
of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,7 the
outcome of which provides the requisite plan to achieve nuclear disarmament;

5. Agrees on the importance and urgency of signatures and ratifications
required to achieve the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-
Ban Treaty;4

6. Calls for the upholding and maintenance of the moratorium on nuclear-
weapon-test explosions or any other nuclear explosions pending the entry into force
of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty;

7. Underlines the urgency of the entry into force of the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in the context of the progress achieved in implementing the
international monitoring system;

8. Calls upon the nuclear-weapon States to implement the commitments
made in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,2 as well as in
other nuclear disarmament or reductions agreements or initiatives, and to apply the
principle of irreversibility by destroying their nuclear warheads and avoid keeping
them in a state that lends itself to their possible redeployment;

9. Acknowledges that the reductions in the number of deployed strategic
nuclear warheads envisaged by the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Reductions (“the
Moscow Treaty”)8 represent a positive first step, and calls on the United States of
America and the Russian Federation to make the Treaty verifiable, irreversible and
transparent and to address non-operational warheads, thus making it an effective
nuclear disarmament measure;

10. Agrees that the further reduction of non-strategic nuclear weapons should
be accorded a higher priority as an important step towards the elimination of nuclear
weapons and be carried out in a comprehensive manner, including:

(a) Further reductions in and elimination of non-strategic nuclear weapons
based on unilateral initiatives and as an integral part of the nuclear-arms reduction
and disarmament process;

(b) The implementation of reductions in a transparent, verifiable and
irreversible manner;

(c) The preservation, reaffirmation and implementation of the 1991 and 1992
presidential nuclear initiatives of the United States of America and the Union of the
Soviet Socialist Republics/Russian Federation on non-strategic nuclear weapons;

(d) The formalization by the Russian Federation and the United States of
America of their presidential nuclear initiatives into legal instruments and the
initiation of negotiations on further reductions of such weapons;

(e) The enhancement of special security and physical protection measures
for the transport and storage of non-strategic nuclear weapons, their components and
related materials through, inter alia, the placing of such weapons in physically
secure central storage sites with a view to their removal and subsequent elimination
by the nuclear-weapon States as a part of the nuclear disarmament process to which
they are committed under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,
as well as the necessary steps to be taken by all nuclear-weapon States in possession
of such weapons in this regard;

(f) The achievement of further confidence-building and transparency
measures to reduce the threats posed by non-strategic nuclear weapons;

(g) The achievement of concrete agreed measures to reduce further the
operational status of non-strategic nuclear weapons systems so as to reduce the risk
of use of non-strategic nuclear weapons;

(h) The undertaking by the nuclear-weapon States that possess these
weapons not to increase the number or types of weapons deployed and not to
develop new types of these weapons or rationalizations for their use;

space in all its aspects, as contained in its decision of 13 February 1992,9 and re-
establish an ad hoc committee as early as possible;

15. Calls upon the nuclear-weapon States to undertake the necessary steps
towards the seamless integration of all five nuclear-weapon States into a process
leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons;

16. Notes that the third and, as appropriate, fourth meetings of the
Preparatory Committee for the 2005 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, taking into account the deliberations and results
of the previous sessions, should make every effort to produce a report containing
recommendations to the Review Conference;

17. Stresses the importance of regular reporting in promoting confidence in
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons;

calls upon the Preparatory Committee for the 2005 Review Conference to allow time
to thoroughly consider the matter of security assurances at its third meeting so as to
make recommendations to the Review Conference on how to take the matter
forward;

20. Calls upon those three States, India, Israel and Pakistan, which are not
yet parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and which
operate unsafeguarded nuclear facilities, to accede to the Treaty as non-nuclear-
weapon States promptly and without condition, to bring into force the required
comprehensive safeguards agreements, together with additional protocols, consistent
with the Model Protocol Additional to the Agreement(s) between State(s) and the
International Atomic Energy Agency for the Application of Safeguards approved by
the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency on 15 May
1997,10 for ensuring nuclear non-proliferation and to reverse clearly and urgently
any policies to pursue any nuclear weapons development or deployment and refrain
from any action that could undermine regional and international peace and security
and the efforts of the international community towards nuclear disarmament and the
prevention of nuclear weapons proliferation;

21. Reaffirms the conviction that the establishment of internationally
recognized nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at
among the States of the regions concerned enhances global and regional peace and
security, strengthens the nuclear non-proliferation regime and contributes towards
realizing the objective of nuclear disarmament;

safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency and to
conclude additional protocols to their safeguards agreements on the basis of the
Model Protocol;

24. Calls upon the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to reconsider its
recent announcements, with a view to being in full compliance with the provisions
of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and in this connection
supports all diplomatic efforts for an early, peaceful resolution of the situation and
for the establishment of an area free of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula;

25. Stresses that the International Atomic Energy Agency must be able to
verify and ensure that nuclear facilities of the States parties to the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons are being used for peaceful purposes only,
and calls on States to cooperate fully and immediately with the Agency in resolving
issues arising from the implementation of their respective obligations towards it;

26. Calls upon the Russian Federation and the United States of America to
approach the International Atomic Energy Agency to carry out the verification
requirements set forth in the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement

agreed on and that is now available to be used in new verification agreements
between the Agency and each of the two States;

27. Calls upon all nuclear-weapon States to make arrangements for the
placing, as soon as practicable, of their fissile material no longer required for
military purposes under International Atomic Energy Agency or other relevant
international verification and to make arrangements for the disposition of such
material for peaceful purposes in order to ensure that such material remains
permanently outside military programmes;

28. Affirms that a nuclear-weapon-free world will ultimately require the
underpinning of a universal and multilaterally negotiated legally binding instrument
or a framework encompassing a mutually reinforcing set of instruments;

29. Acknowledges the reports of the Secretary-General on the implementation
of resolution 57/59,11 and requests him to prepare a report, within existing
resources, on the implementation of the present resolution;

30. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-ninth session an
item entitled “Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: a new agenda”, and to review
the implementation of the present resolution at that session.
