A/C.3/76/L.59

food rations on the health and well-being of refugees globally and especially its

urgently support funding and further explore innovative financing mechanisms aimed 

at ensuring access to COVID-19 vaccines for all, including persons of concern to the

continuing to work on those issues;  



A/C.3/76/L.59

access for persons of concern to the Office of the High Commissioner, to sexual and 

reproductive health care services, as well as basic health care services and 

psychosocial support from the onset of emergencies, while recognizing that relevant

in humanitarian emergencies; 

 50. Encourages States to put in place, if they have not yet done so, appropriate 

systems and procedures to ensure that the best interests of the child are a primary 

consideration with regard to all actions concerning refugee children and to protect 

them from all forms of abuse, neglect, exploitation and violence;  

 51. Notes with concern that a large proportion of the world’s out-of-school 

population lives in conflict-affected areas, and calls upon States, in their 

implementation of the global compact on refugees, to lend support to host countries 

in providing quality primary and secondary education in safe learning environments 

for all refugee children, and to develop more inclusive, responsive and resilient

 55. Notes with concern that arbitrary deprivation of nationality pushes people

person stateless;  

 56. Strongly reaffirms the fundamental importance and the purely 

humanitarian and non-political character of the function of the Office of the High 

Commissioner of providing international protection to refugees and seeking durable 

solutions for them and for refugee situations, and recalls that those solutions include 

voluntary repatriation and, where appropriate and feasible, local integration and 

resettlement in a third country, while reaffirming that voluntary repatriation, 

supported, as necessary, by rehabilitation and development assistance to facilitate 

sustainable reintegration, remains the preferred solution;  

 57. Reaffirms that accelerating complementary pathways to solutions is 

crucial for addressing protracted refugee situations, and recognizes the importance of 

the work of the Office of the High Commissioner for seeking durable solutions for

access to complementary and sustainable pathways to protection and solutions for

discussing and clarifying the role of the Office in mixed movements in order to better

and regional obligations, so as to strengthen the refugee protection regime;  

 71. Expresses deep concern about the adverse sudden and slow onset impacts 

of climate change, natural disasters and environmental degradation, which are 

increasing in intensity and frequency, and which interact with the drivers of forced 

displacement and disproportionately affect persons in vulnerable situations, including 

forcibly displaced populations in developing countries and particularly in small island 

developing States and the least developed countries, and welcomes the increased 

attention and efforts of the Office to address these challenges in its work, including 



 
A/C.3/76/L.59 

 

11/11 21-15858 

 

the adoption of a strategic framework for climate action, within its mandate, and in 

consultation with national authorities and in cooperation with competent agencies;

including with a view to building local and national resilience and capacity to prevent, 

prepare for and respond to displacement in this context;  

 73. Urges all States and relevant non-governmental and other organizations, 

in conjunction with the Office of the High Commissioner, in a spirit of international 

solidarity and burden- and responsibility-sharing, to cooperate and to mobilize 

resources, including through financial and in-kind assistance, as well as direct aid to 

host countries, refugee populations and the communities hosting them, with a view to 

enhancing their capacity and reducing the heavy burden borne by countries and 

communities hosting refugees, in particular those that have received large numbers 

of refugees and asylum seekers, and whose generosity is appreciated;  

 74. Calls upon the Office of the High Commissioner to continue to play its 

catalytic role in mobilizing assistance from the international community to address 

the root causes as well as the economic, environmental, development, security and 

social impacts of large-scale refugee populations in developing countries, in 

particular the least developed countries, and countries with economies in transition, 

and notes with appreciation those States, organizations and individuals that contribute 

to improving the conditions for refugees through building their resilience and that of 

their host communities, while working towards a durable solution;  

 75. Acknowledges with appreciation the cooperation of the Office of the High 

Commissioner with development partners, noting the advantages of complementarity 

of funding sources to support refugees and host communities as requested by host 

Governments, and the importance of doing so in a manner that does not negatively 

impact or reduce support for broader development objectives in host countries and, 

where appropriate, countries of origin;  

 76. Expresses concern that the needs required to protect and assist persons of 

concern to the Office of the High Commissioner continue to increase and that the gap 

between global needs and available resources continues to grow, appreciates the 

continued and increasing hospitality of host countries and generosity of donors, and 

therefore calls upon the Office to further enhance efforts to broaden its donor base so 

as to achieve greater burden- and responsibility-sharing by reinforcing cooperation 

with governmental donors, non-governmental donors and the private sector;  

 77. Recognizes that adequate and timely resources are essential for the Office 

of the High Commissioner to continue to fulfil the mandate conferred upon it through 

its statute11 and by subsequent General Assembly resolutions on refugees and other 

persons of concern, recalls its resolution 58/153 of 22 December 2003 and subsequent 

resolutions on the Office of the High Commissioner concerning, inter a lia, the 

implementation of paragraph 20 of the statute of the Office, and urges Governments 

and other donors to respond promptly to annual and supplementary appeals issued by 

the Office for requirements under its programmes, keeping in mind the importance of 

unearmarked and other flexible funding;  

 78. Requests the High Commissioner to report on his annual activities to the 

General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.
