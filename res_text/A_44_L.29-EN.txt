Taking note with appreciation of the recorr~endations lnade in the report of the
Panel of Eminent Persons that held public hearings on the activities of
transnational corporations in South Africa and Namibia, at Geneva from 4 to
6 September 1989, 1/

Convinced that sanctions and other restrictive measures have ha.d a significant
impact on recent developments in South Africa and remain a most eff~ tive and
necessary instrument of pressure in contributing to a political solution to the
crisis in that country,

Considering that measures taken by States individually or collectively, while
commendable, vary in coverage and degree of enforcement and monitoring and are not
always addressed at those areas of the South African economy which are vulnerable
to international pressure,

Con~erned at the increasing number of States that exploit the trade gaps
created by the uneven and uncoordinated impositi~n of restrictive measures,

~.inv with concern that a number of transnational corporations, including
banks, continue to provide support to the apartheid economy by maintaining
financial and technological and other ties with South Africa,

Commending those States which have already adopted strict measures against the
apartheid regime in accordance with United Nations resolutions, as well as
non-governmental organizations and individuals, for their contribution to the
isolation of the apartheid regime,

1. Urges all States that have not yet done so, pending the imposition of
comprehensive and mandatory sanctions, to adopt legislative and/or comparable
measures to impose effective sanctions against South Africa and, in particular:

(a) To impose embargoes on the supply of all products, in particular computer
and communications equipment, technologies, skills and services, including military
intelligence, that can be used for the military and nuclear industry of South
Africa;

(b) To impose embargoes on the supply of oil and petroleum products and oil
technology;

(c) To prohibit the import of coal, gold, other minerals and agricultural
products from South Africa;

(d) To induce transnational corporations, banks and financial institutions to
withdraw effectively from South Africa by ceasing equity investment and cutting off
non-equity links, particularly those involving transfer of high technology and
know-how;

(e) To induce banks to cease the provision of new credits and loans;

(f) To consider ending pr~mptly double taxation agreements with South Africa
and any form of tax relief in respect of income from investments in ~~at country;

(g) To restrict landing and port rights to South African air and sea carriers
and to sever direct air, sea and other transport links with South Africa;

(h) To ensure, through appropriate me~3ures, that their citizens refrain from
serving in South Africa's armed fbrces and other sensitive sectors;

(i) To take appropriate measures to ensure the effectiveness of the sports
and cultural boycott of apartheid South Africa;

2. Also urges all States to monitor strictly the implementation of the above
measures and adopt, ~hen necessary, legislation proviaing for penalties on
individuals anJ enterprises violating those measures;

3. Calls upon Governments, intergovernmental organizations, the specialized
agencies of the United Nations, non-governmental organizations and the pUblic at
large to take full account of the reco~endations of the Panel of Eminent Persons
that held pUblic hearings on the activities of transnational corporations in South
Africa and Namibia; i/

4. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its
forty-fifth session on measures to monitor sanctions undertaken by the United
Nations system, governments and non-governmental agencies, taking fully into
account reports of existing intergovernmental monitoring mechanisms.
