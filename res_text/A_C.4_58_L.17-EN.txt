The General Assembly,

Gravely concerned about the continuation of the tragic events that have taken
place since 28 September 2000, including the excessive use of force by the Israeli
occupying forces against Palestinian civilians, resulting in thousands of deaths and
injuries,

Having considered the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli
Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of
the Occupied Territories4 and the relevant reports of the Secretary-General,5

Recalling the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government
Arrangements of 13 September 19936 and the subsequent implementation
agreements between the Palestinian and Israeli sides,

Expressing the hope that the Israeli occupation will be brought to an early end
and that therefore the violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people will
cease,

1. Commends the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices
Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the
Occupied Territories for its efforts in performing the tasks assigned to it by the
General Assembly and for its impartiality;

2. Reiterates its demand that Israel, the occupying Power, cooperate with
the Special Committee in implementing its mandate;

3. Deplores those policies and practices of Israel that violate the human
rights of the Palestinian people and other Arabs of the occupied territories, as
reflected in the reports of the Special Committee covering the reporting period;

4. Expresses grave concern about the situation in the Occupied Palestinian
Territory, including East Jerusalem, since 28 September 2000, as a result of Israeli
practices and measures, and especially condemns the excessive and indiscriminate
use of force against the civilian population, including extrajudicial executions,
which has resulted in more than 2,600 Palestinian deaths and tens of thousands of
injuries;

5. Requests the Special Committee, pending complete termination of the
Israeli occupation, to continue to investigate Israeli policies and practices in the
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories
occupied by Israel since 1967, especially Israeli violations of the Geneva
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12
August 1949,1 and to consult, as appropriate, with the International Committee of
the Red Cross according to its regulations in order to ensure that the welfare and
human rights of the peoples of the occupied territories are safeguarded and to report
to the Secretary-General as soon as possible and whenever the need arises thereafter;

6. Also requests the Special Committee to submit regularly to the Secretary-
General periodic reports on the current situation in the Occupied Palestinian
Territory, including East Jerusalem;

7. Further requests the Special Committee to continue to investigate the
treatment of prisoners and detainees in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including

those required for its visits to the occupied territories, so that it may investigate
Israeli policies and practices referred to in the present resolution;

(b) To continue to make available such additional staff as may be necessary
to assist the Special Committee in the performance of its tasks;

(c) To circulate regularly to Member States the periodic reports mentioned in
paragraph 6 above;

(d) To ensure the widest circulation of the reports of the Special Committee
and of information regarding its activities and findings, by all means available,
through the Department of Public Information of the Secretariat and, where
necessary, to reprint those reports of the Special Committee that are no longer
available;

(e) To report to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session on the tasks
entrusted to him in the present resolution;

9. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-ninth session the

Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the
Occupied Territories”.
