Governing Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the 

Monitoring of Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation approved by

of improvement, to apply the following guidelines when preparing the next proposed 

programme plan and programme performance documents for the remainder of the

performance measures at the subprogramme level, in line with the results -based 

budgeting framework;

and ensuring that resources are justified in terms of the requirements to implement 

deliverables as contributions to the planned results;

to be applied in the context of the programme budget proposals to be submitted in

provisions of relevant General Assembly resolutions, including resolutions 47/212 A 

of 23 December 1992 and 72/266 A;  

 (d) Enhancing the link between the preceding programme plans and the 

proposed future plans, with a view to ensuring consistency and continuity;  

 (e) Incorporating more general information on programmes and subprogrammes 

by showing not only examples of actual and planned results, but also an overview of 

activities and general strategy that encompasses a comprehensive overall account of 

the actual and planned results;  

 (f) Presenting performance information on a comprehensive set of results, 

which would allow for enhanced oversight, transparency and accountability in the 

implementation of all activities in the programme plan as approved by the General 

Assembly;
