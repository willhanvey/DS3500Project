in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,7 and noting in particular the reply of the Court, 

including on the right of peoples to self-determination, which is a right erga omnes,8 

 Recalling the conclusion of the Court, in its advisory opinion of 9 July 2004, 

that the construction of the wall by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied 

Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, along with measures previously 

taken, severely impedes the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination,9 

 Stressing the urgency of achieving without delay an end to the Israeli occupation 

that began in 1967 and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace settlement between 

the Palestinian and Israeli sides, based on the relevant resolutions of the United 

Nations, the Madrid terms of reference, including the principle of land for peace, the 

Arab Peace Initiative10 and the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State solution 

to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,11 

 Stressing also the need for respect for and preservation of the territorial unity, 

contiguity and integrity of all of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 

Jerusalem, and recalling in this regard its resolution 58/292 of 6 May 2004, 

 Recalling its resolution 73/158 of 17 December 2018, 

 Recalling also its resolution 67/19 of 29 November 2012, 

 Affirming the right of all States in the region to live in peace within secure and 

internationally recognized borders, 

 1. Reaffirms the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, 

including the right to their independent State of Palestine; 

 2. Urges all States and the specialized agencies and organizations of the 

United Nations system to continue to support and assist the Palestinian people in the 

early realization of their right to self-determination.
