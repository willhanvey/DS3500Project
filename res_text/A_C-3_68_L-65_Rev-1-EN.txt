entitled “Global efforts for the total elimination of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance and the comprehensive implementation of and 
follow-up to the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action”, 

 Acknowledging other important initiatives within the General Assembly aimed 
at raising awareness about the suffering of victims of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, including in the historical perspective, in 
particular regarding commemoration of the victims of the transatlantic slave trade, 

 Recalling the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal and the Judgement of the 
Tribunal, which recognized as criminal, inter alia, the SS organization and all its 
integral parts, including the Waffen SS, through its officially accepted members 
implicated in or with knowledge of the commission of war crimes and crimes 
against humanity connected with the Second World War, as well as other relevant 
provisions of the Charter and the Judgement, 

 Recalling also the relevant provisions of the Durban Declaration and

particular paragraph 2 of the Declaration and paragraph 86 of the Programme of 
Action, as well as the relevant provisions of the outcome document of the Durban 
Review Conference, of 24 April 2009,10 in particular paragraphs 11 and 54, 

 Alarmed, in this regard, at the spread in many parts of the world of various 
extremist political parties, movements and groups, including neo-Nazis and 
skinhead groups, as well as similar extremist ideological movements, 

 Deeply concerned by all recent manifestations of violence and terrorism 
incited by violent nationalism, racism, xenophobia and related intolerance, 

 1. Reaffirms the relevant provisions of the Durban Declaration9 and of the 
outcome document of the Durban Review Conference,10 in which States condemned 
the persistence and resurgence of neo-Nazism, neo-Fascism and violent nationalist 
ideologies based on racial and national prejudice and stated that those phenomena 
could never be justified in any instance or in any circumstances;

 2. Takes note of the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary 
forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, prepared 
in accordance with the request contained in General Assembly resolution 67/154;11  

 3. Expresses its appreciation to the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights for her commitment to maintaining the fight against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance as one of the priority activities of 
her Office, and welcomes in this regard the launch by the Office of the High 
Commissioner of the database on practical means to combat racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; 

 4. Expresses deep concern about the glorification, in any form, of the Nazi 
movement, neo-Nazism and former members of the Waffen SS organization, 
including by erecting monuments and memorials and holding public demonstrations 
in the name of the glorification of the Nazi past, the Nazi movement and neo-Nazism, 
as well as by declaring or attempting to declare such members and those who fought 
against the anti-Hitler coalition and collaborated with the Nazi movement participants 
in national liberation movements; 

 5. Emphasizes the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur that “any 
commemorative celebration of the Nazi Waffen SS organization and its crimes 
against humanity, whether official or non-official, should be prohibited by States”; 

 6. Expresses concern at recurring attempts to desecrate or demolish 
monuments erected in remembrance of those who fought against Nazism during the 
Second World War, as well as to unlawfully exhume or remove the remains of such 
persons, and in this regard urges States to fully comply with their relevant 
obligations, inter alia, under article 34 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva 
Conventions of 1949;12  

 7. Notes with concern the increase in the number of racist incidents 
worldwide, including the rise of skinhead groups, which have been responsible for 
many of these incidents, as well as the resurgence of racist and xenophobic violence 
targeting, inter alia, persons belonging to national, ethnic, religious or linguistic 
minorities; 

 8. Reaffirms that such acts may be qualified to fall within the scope of the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,3 
that they may not be justified as exercises of the rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and of association as well as the rights to freedom of opinion and 
expression, and that they may fall within the scope of article 20 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights2 and may legitimately be restricted as set out 
in articles 19, 21 and 22 of the Covenant; 

 9. Expresses deep concern at attempts at commercial advertising aimed at 
exploiting the sufferings of the victims of war crimes and crimes against humanity 
committed during the Second World War by the Nazi regime; 

 10. Stresses that the practices described above do injustice to the memory of 
the countless victims of crimes against humanity committed in the Second World 
War, in particular those committed by the SS organization and by those who fought

against the anti-Hitler coalition and collaborated with the Nazi movement, and may 
negatively influence children and young people, and that failure by States to 
effectively address such practices is incompatible with the obligations of States 
Members of the United Nations under its Charter and is incompatible with the 
purposes and principles of the Organization; 

 11. Also stresses that such practices fuel contemporary forms of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and contribute to the 
spread and multiplication of various extremist political parties, movements and 
groups, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and in this regard calls for 
increased vigilance; 

 12. Expresses concern at the human rights and democratic challenges posed 
by all extremist political parties, movements and groups; 

 13. Emphasizes the need to take the measures necessary to put an end to the 
practices described above, and calls upon States to take more effective measures in 
accordance with international human rights law to combat those phenomena and the 
extremist movements, which pose a real threat to democratic values; 

 14. Encourages States to adopt further measures to provide training to the 
police and other law enforcement bodies on the ideologies of extremist political 
parties, movements and groups whose advocacy constitutes incitement to racist and 
xenophobic violence and to strengthen their capacity to address racist and 
xenophobic crimes and to fulfil their responsibility of bringing to justice the 
perpetrators of such crimes and to combat impunity; 

 15. Notes the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur regarding the 
responsibility of political leaders and parties in relation to messages that incite 
racial discrimination or xenophobia;  

 16. Recalls the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur to introduce into 
national criminal law a provision according to which committing an offence with 
racist or xenophobic motivations or aims constitutes an aggravating circumstance 
allowing for enhanced penalties, and encourages those States whose legislation does 
not contain such provisions to consider that recommendation; 

 17. Underlines that the roots of extremism are multifaceted and must be 
addressed through adequate measures such as education, awareness-raising and the 
promotion of dialogue, and in this regard recommends the increase of measures to 
raise awareness among young people of the dangers of the ideologies and activities 
of extremist political parties, movements and groups; 

 18. Reaffirms, in this regard, the particular importance of all forms of 
education, including human rights education, as a complement to legislative 
measures, as outlined by the Special Rapporteur; 

 19. Emphasizes the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur presented at 
the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly, in which he emphasized the 
importance of history classes in teaching the dramatic events and human suffering 
which arose out of the adoption of ideologies such as Nazism and Fascism; 

 20. Stresses the importance of other positive measures and initiatives aimed 
at bringing communities together and providing them with space for genuine 
dialogue, such as round tables, working groups and seminars, including training 



 A/C.3/68/L.65/Rev.1
 

5/7 13-56682 
 

seminars for State agents and media professionals, as well as awareness-raising 
activities, especially those initiated by civil society representatives which require 
continued State support; 

 21. Calls upon States to continue to invest in education, in both conventional 
and non-conventional curricula, inter alia, in order to transform attitudes and correct 
ideas of racial hierarchies and superiority promoted by extremist political parties, 
movements and groups and counter their negative influence; 

 22. Underlines the potentially positive role that relevant United Nations 
entities and programmes, in particular the United Nations Educational, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization, can play in the aforementioned areas; 

 23. Reaffirms article 4 of the Convention, according to which States parties 
to that instrument condemn all propaganda and all organizations that are based on 
ideas or theories of superiority of one race or group of persons of one colour or 
ethnic origin, or that attempt to justify or promote racial hatred and discrimination 
in any form, and undertake to adopt immediate and positive measures designed to 
eradicate all incitement to, or acts of, such discrimination and, to that end, with due 
regard to the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 
and the rights expressly set forth in article 5 of the Convention, inter alia: 

 (a) Shall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas 
based on racial superiority or hatred, and incitement to racial discrimination, as well 
as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons 
of another colour or ethnic origin, and also the provision of any assistance to racist 
activities, including the financing thereof; 

 (b) Shall declare illegal and prohibit organizations, and organized and all 
other propaganda activities, that promote and incite racial discrimination, and shall 
recognize participation in such organizations or activities as an offence punishable 
by law; 

 (c) Shall not permit public authorities or public institutions, national or 
local, to promote or incite racial discrimination; 

 24. Also reaffirms that, as underlined in paragraph 13 of the outcome 
document of the Durban Review Conference, any advocacy of national, racial or 
religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence 
should be prohibited by law, that all dissemination of ideas based on racial 
superiority or hatred, or incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts of 
violence or incitement to such acts, shall be declared offences punishable by law, in 
accordance with the international obligations of States, and that these prohibitions 
are consistent with freedom of opinion and expression; 

 25. Recognizes the positive role that the exercise of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, as well as full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and 
impart information, including through the Internet, can play in combating racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; 

 26. Expresses concern about the use of the Internet to propagate racism, 
racial hatred, xenophobia, racial discrimination and related intolerance, and in this 
regard calls upon States parties to the Covenant to implement fully articles 19 and 
20 thereof, which guarantee the right to freedom of expression and outline the 
grounds on which the exercise of this right can be legitimately restricted; 



A/C.3/68/L.65/Rev.1  
 

13-56682 6/7 
 

 27. Recognizes the need to promote the use of new information and 
communications technologies, including the Internet, to contribute to the fight 
against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; 

 28. Also recognizes the positive role that the media can play in combating 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, promoting a 
culture of tolerance and representing the diversity of a multicultural society;  

 29. Encourages those States that have made reservations to article 4 of the 
Convention to give serious consideration to withdrawing such reservations as a 
matter of priority, as stressed by the Special Rapporteur; 

 30. Notes the importance of strengthening cooperation at the regional and 
international levels with the aim of countering all manifestations of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, in particular regarding issues 
raised in the present resolution; 

 31. Stresses the importance of cooperating closely with civil society and 
international and regional human rights mechanisms in order to counter effectively 
all manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance, as well as extremist political parties, movements and groups, including 
neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and other similar extremist ideological movements 
that incite racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; 

 32. Encourages States parties to the Convention to ensure that their 
legislation incorporates the provisions of the Convention, including those of 
article 4; 

 33. Encourages States to adopt the legislation necessary to combat racism 
while ensuring that the definition of racial discrimination set out therein complies 
with article 1 of the Convention; 

 34. Recalls that any legislative or constitutional measures adopted with a 
view to countering extremist political parties, movements and groups, including 
neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and similar extremist ideological movements should 
be in conformity with the relevant international human rights norms, in particular 
articles 4 and 5 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination and articles 19 to 22 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights; 

 35. Recalls the request of the Commission on Human Rights, in its resolution 
2005/5,5 that the Special Rapporteur continue to reflect on this issue, make relevant 
recommendations in his future reports and seek and take into account in this regard 
the views of Governments and non-governmental organizations; 

 36. Encourages States to include in their reports for the universal periodic 
review and to treaty bodies information on the steps taken to combat racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, including with the aim of 
implementing the provisions of the present resolution; 

 37. Requests the Special Rapporteur to prepare, for submission to the 
General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session and to the Human Rights Council at its 
twenty-sixth session, reports on the implementation of the present resolution, in 
particular regarding paragraphs 4 to 6, 8 to 10, 19 and 20 above, based on the views 



 A/C.3/68/L.65/Rev.1
 

7/7 13-56682 
 

collected in accordance with the request of the Commission, as recalled in 
paragraph 35 above; 

 38. Expresses its appreciation to those Governments that have provided 
information to the Special Rapporteur in the course of the preparation of his report 
to the General Assembly, and notes the increase in such contributions received from 
States; 

 39. Stresses that such information is important for the sharing of experiences 
and best practices in the fight against extremist political parties, movements and 
groups, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and other extremist ideological 
movements that incite racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance; 

 40. Encourages Governments and non-governmental organizations to 
cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur in the exercise of the tasks outlined in 
paragraph 35 above; 

 41. Encourages Governments, non-governmental organizations and relevant
