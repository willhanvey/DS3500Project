Draft resolution

The Security Council,

Recalling its resolutions and the statements by its President on the Great Lakes
region of Africa and concerning the situation in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo and in Burundi, and in particular resolutions 1649 and 1650 of 21 December
2005,

Recalling its resolution 1625 (2005) on strengthening the effectiveness of the
Security Council and the role of civil society in the prevention and resolution of
armed conflict, particularly in Africa,

United Nations and regional organizations and General Assembly resolution 59/213
(2004) on cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union,

Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and
political independence of all States in the region, and recalling the importance of the
principles of good-neighbourliness, non-interference and cooperation in the
relations among States in the region,

Reiterating its condemnation of the genocide in Rwanda of 1994 and the
armed conflicts which have plagued the Great Lakes region of Africa in the past
decade and expressing its profound concern at the violations of human rights and
international humanitarian law resulting in wide scale loss of life, human suffering
and destruction of property,

Aware that the link between the illegal exploitation of natural resources, the

the factors fuelling and exacerbating conflicts in the Great Lakes region of Africa,
and especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,

Expressing its deep concern at the devastating impact of conflict and
insecurity on the humanitarian situation throughout the Great Lakes region and their
implications for regional peace and security, especially where arms and armed
groups move across borders, such as the long-running and brutal insurgency by the
Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) in northern Uganda which has caused the death,
abduction and displacement of thousands of innocent civilians in Uganda, the Sudan
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
