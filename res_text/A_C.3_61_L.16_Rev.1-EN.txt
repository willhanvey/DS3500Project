framework for all actions concerning children, including adolescents; 

 2. Urges States that have not yet done so to become parties to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child2 and the Optional Protocols thereto3 as a 
matter of priority and to implement them fully by, inter alia, putting in place 
effective national legislation, policies and action plans, strengthening relevant 
governmental structures for children and ensuring adequate and systematic training 
in the rights of the child for professional groups working with and for children; 

 3. Urges States parties to withdraw reservations that are incompatible with 
the object and purpose of the Convention or the Optional Protocols thereto and to 
consider reviewing other reservations with a view to withdrawing them; 

 4. Welcomes the work of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, and 
calls upon all States to strengthen their cooperation with the Committee, to comply 
in a timely manner with their reporting obligations under the Convention and the 
Optional Protocols thereto, in accordance with the guidelines elaborated by the 
Committee, and to take into account its recommendations on implementation of the 
Convention; 

 5. Requests all relevant organs and mechanisms of the United Nations 
system regularly and systematically to incorporate a strong child rights perspective 
throughout all activities in the fulfilment of their mandates, as well as to ensure that 
their staff are trained in child rights matters, and calls upon States to continue to 
cooperate closely with all these organs and mechanisms, in particular the special 
rapporteurs and special representatives of the United Nations system; 

 6. Encourages States to strengthen their national statistical capacities and to 
use statistics disaggregated, inter alia, by age, gender and other relevant factors that 
may lead to disparities and other statistical indicators at the national, subregional, 
regional and international levels to develop and assess social policies and 
programmes so that economic and social resources are used efficiently and 
effectively for the full realization of the rights of the child; 
 

  II

  Registration, family relations and adoption or other forms of alternative care 
 

 7. Once again urges all States parties to intensify their efforts to comply 
with their obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child to preserve 
the child’s identity, including nationality, name and family relations, as recognized 
by law, to allow for the registration of the child immediately after birth, to ensure 
that registration procedures are simple, expeditious and effective and provided at 
minimal or no cost and to raise awareness of the importance of birth registration at 
the national, regional and local levels;

obligations of each State, the right of a child whose parents reside in different States 
to maintain, on a regular basis, save in exceptional circumstances, personal relations 
and direct contact with both parents by providing enforceable means of access and 
visitation in both States and by respecting the principle that both parents have 
common responsibilities for the upbringing and development of their children; 

 10. Also calls upon States to address and pay particular attention to cases of 
international parental or familial child abduction, and encourages States to engage in 
multilateral and bilateral cooperation to resolve these cases, preferably by accession 
to or ratification of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International 
Child Abduction,14 and therefore to be in full compliance with the Convention, and 
to facilitate, inter alia, the return of the child to the country in which he or she 
resided immediately before the removal or retention; 

 11. Further calls upon States to take all necessary measures to prevent and 
combat illegal adoptions and all adoptions that are not in the best interests of the 
child;

poverty eradication at the global, regional and country levels, recognizing that 
strengthened availability and effective allocation of resources are required at all 
these levels, in order to ensure that all the internationally agreed development and 
poverty eradication goals, including those set out in the United Nations Millennium 
Declaration,15 are realized within their time framework, reaffirming that 
investments in children and the realization of their rights are among the most 
effective ways to eradicate poverty; 

 (b) Recognizing the right to education on the basis of equal opportunity and 
non-discrimination by making primary education compulsory and available free to 
all children, ensuring that all children have access to education of good quality, as 
well as making secondary education generally available and accessible to all, in 
particular through the progressive introduction of free education, bearing in mind 
that special measures to ensure equal access, including affirmative action, contribute 
to achieving equal opportunity and combating exclusion, and ensuring school 
attendance, particularly for girls and children from low-income families; 

 (c) Taking all necessary measures to ensure the right of the child to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and developing sustainable

  III 
Children and poverty 
 

 42. Reiterates that eradicating poverty is the greatest global challenge facing 
the world today and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, in 
particular for developing countries, and recognizes that chronic poverty remains the 
single biggest obstacle to meeting the needs and protecting and promoting the rights 
of children, and that urgent national and international action is therefore required to 
eliminate it; 

 43. Recognizes that the number of people living in extreme poverty in many 
countries continues to increase, with women and children constituting the majority 
and the most affected groups, in particular in the least developed countries and in 
sub-Saharan Africa;

 44. Also recognizes that growing inequality within countries is a major 
challenge to poverty eradication, particularly affecting those living in middle-
income countries, and stresses the need to support the development efforts of these 
countries; 

 45. Reaffirms that democracy, development, peace and security, and the full 
and effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms are 
interdependent and mutually reinforcing and contribute to the eradication of extreme 
poverty; 

 46. Recognizes that children living in poverty are deprived of nutrition, water 
and sanitation facilities, access to basic health-care services, shelter, education, 
participation and protection, and that while a severe lack of goods and services hurts 
every human being, it is most threatening and harmful to children, leaving them 
unable to enjoy their rights, to reach their full potential and to participate as full 
members of society; 

 47. Emphasizes the critical role of education, both formal and non-formal, in 
particular basic education and training, especially for girls, in empowering those 
living in poverty, and in this regard reaffirms the importance of Education for All 
programmes and the need to bridge the divide between formal and non-formal 
education, taking into account the need to ensure the good quality of the educational 
services; 

 48. Recognizes the devastating effect of HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis 
and other infectious and contagious diseases on human development, economic 
growth, food security and poverty eradication efforts in all regions, in particular in 
the least developed countries and in sub Saharan Africa, and urges Governments and 
the international community to give urgent priority to preventing and combating 
those diseases; 

 49. Also recognizes that countries struggle to develop when their children 
grow up malnourished, poorly educated or ravaged by disease, as these factors can 
perpetuate the generational cycle of poverty; 

 50. Reaffirms that the primary responsibility for ensuring an enabling 
environment for securing the well-being of children, in which the rights of each and 
every child are promoted and respected, rests with each individual State; 

 51. Calls upon all States and the international community to mobilize all 
necessary resources, support and efforts to eradicate poverty, according to national 
plans and strategies and in consultation with national Governments, including 
through an integrated and multifaceted approach based on the rights and well-being 
of children; 

 52. Further calls upon all States, and the international community, where 
appropriate: 

 (a) To integrate the international obligations related to the rights and well-
being of the child and the internationally agreed development goals, including the 
Millennium Development Goals, in national development strategies and plans, 
including the poverty reduction strategy papers where they exist, and calls upon the 
international community to continue to support developing countries in the 
implementation of those development strategies and plans; 



 A/C.3/61/L.16/Rev.1

 

13 06-62121 
 

 (b) To ensure a continuum of care from pregnancy through childhood, 
recognizing that maternal, newborn and child health are inseparable and 
interdependent, and that the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals 
must be based on a strong commitment to the rights of women, children and 
adolescents; 

 (c) To work for a solid effort of national and international action to enhance 
children’s health, to promote prenatal care and to lower infant and child mortality in 
all countries and among all peoples; 

 (d) To develop a national strategy of prevention and treatment to effectively 
address the condition of obstetric fistula and to further develop a multisectoral, 
comprehensive and integrated approach to bring about lasting solutions and a 
meaningful response to the problem of obstetric fistula and related morbidities; 

 (e) To promote the provision of clean water in all communities for all their 
children, as well as universal access to sanitation; 

 (f) To take all necessary measures to eradicate hunger, malnutrition and 
famine; 

 (g) To mobilize the necessary additional resources from all sources of 
financing for development, including domestic resources, international investment 
flows, official development assistance and external debt relief, and to commit 
themselves to a universal, open, equitable, rule-based, predictable and non-
discriminatory global trading system in order to stimulate development worldwide 
to ensure the well-being of the most vulnerable sectors of the populations, in 
particular children; 
 

  Follow-up 
 

 53. Decides:
