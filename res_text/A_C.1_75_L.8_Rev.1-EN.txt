 Noting that providing assistance, upon request, to build capacity in the area of 

information and communications technology security is essential for international 

security, 

 Affirming that capacity-building measures should seek to promote the use of 

information and communications technologies for peaceful purposes,  

 Confirming that information and communications technologies are dual-use 

technologies and can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes,  

 Expressing concern that a number of States are developing information and 

communications technology capabilities for military purposes and that the use of such 

technologies in future conflicts between States is becoming more likely,  

 Stressing that it is in the interest of all States to promote the use of information 

and communications technologies for peaceful purposes, with the objective of 

shaping a community of shared future for humankind in cyberspace, and that States 

also have an interest in preventing conflict arising from the use of such technologies,  

 Expressing concern that embedding harmful hidden functions in information 

and communications technologies could be used in ways that would affect the secure 

and reliable use of such technologies and the information and communications 

technology supply chain for products and services, erode trust in commerce and 

damage national security, 

 Considering that it is necessary to prevent the use of information resources or 

technologies for criminal or terrorist purposes,  

 Underlining the importance of respect for human rights and fundamental 

freedoms in the use of information and communications technologies,  

 Noting that the United Nations should play a leading role in promoting dialogue 

among Member States to develop common understandings on the security and use of 

information and communications technologies, as well as in developing common 

understandings on the application of international law and norms, rules and principles 

for responsible State behaviour in this sphere, encourage regional efforts, promote 

confidence-building and transparency measures and support capacity-building and 

the dissemination of best practices,  

 Emphasizing the global importance of the negotiation process of the Open-

ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and 

Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, established pursuant to 

General Assembly resolution 73/27, 

 Noting the truly democratic, inclusive and transparent nature of the discussion 

within the Open-ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information 

and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, 

 Recalling that, in considering the application of international law to State use of 

information and communications technologies, the Group of Governmental Experts 

on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the  Context 

of International Security, in its 2015 report,1 identified as of central importance the 

commitments of States to the following principles of the Charter of the United Nations 

and other international law: sovereign equality; the settlement of international 

disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and 

justice are not endangered; refraining in their international relations from the threat 

or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, 

or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations; respect

for human rights and fundamental freedoms; and non-intervention in the internal 

affairs of other States, 

 Confirming the conclusions of the Group of Governmental Experts, in its 2013 2 

and 2015 reports, that international law, and in particular the Charter of the United 

Nations, is applicable and essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting 

an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful information and communications 

technology environment, that voluntary and non-binding norms, rules and principles 

of responsible behaviour of States in the use of information and communications 

technologies can reduce risks to international peace, security and stability, and that, 

given the unique attributes of such technologies, additional norms can be developed 

over time, 

 Confirming also that State sovereignty and international norms and principles 

that flow from sovereignty apply to State conduct of information and communications 

technology-related activities and to their jurisdiction over information and 

communications technology infrastructure within their territory,  

 Reaffirming the right and duty of States to combat, within their constitutional 

prerogatives, the dissemination of false or distorted news, which  can be interpreted 

as interference in the internal affairs of other States or as being harmful to the 

promotion of peace, cooperation and friendly relations among States and nations,  

 Recognizing the duty of a State to abstain from any defamatory campaign, 

vilification or hostile propaganda for the purpose of intervening or interfering in the 

internal affairs of other States,  

 Stressing that, while States have a primary responsibility for maintaining a 

secure and peaceful information and communications technology environment, 

effective international cooperation would benefit from identifying mechanisms for 

the participation, as appropriate, of the private sector, academia and civil society 

organizations, 

 1. Decides to convene, starting from 2021, with a view to ensuring the 

uninterrupted and continuous nature of the democratic, inclusive and transparent 

negotiation process on security in the use of information and communications 

technologies, under the auspices of the United Nations, a new open-ended working 

group on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies 

2021–2025, acting on a consensus basis, to continue, as a priority, to further develop 

the rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour of States and the ways for 

their implementation and, if necessary, to introduce changes to them or elaborate 

additional rules of behaviour; to consider initiatives of States aimed at ensuring 

security in the use of information and communications technologies; to establish, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, regular institutional dialogue with the broad 

participation of States; to continue to study, with a view to promoting common 

understandings, existing and potential threats in the sphere of information security, 

inter alia, data security, and possible cooperative measures to prevent and counter 

such threats, and how international law applies to the use of information and 

communications technologies by States, as well as confidence-building measures and 

capacity-building; and to submit, for adoption by consensus, annual progress reports 

and a final report on the results of its work to the General Assembly at its eightieth 

session;  

 2. Also decides that, upon the conclusion of the work of the current Open-

ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and

Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, the General Assembly 

at its seventy-fifth session may adopt a decision in this respect;  

 3. Further decides that the open-ended working group on security of and in 

the use of information and communications technologies 2021–2025 shall start its 

activities upon the conclusion of the work of the current Open-ended Working Group 

and considering its outcomes, and shall hold its organizational session in 2021 in 

order to agree on the organizational arrangements connected with the group;  

 4. Decides that the open-ended working group on security of and in the use 

of information and communications technologies 2021–2025 may decide to establish 

thematic subgroups, as the Member States deem necessary, with a view to fulfilling 

its mandate and facilitating the exchange of views among States on specific issues 

related to its mandate, and may decide to interact, as appropriate, with other interested 

parties, including businesses, non-governmental organizations and academia;  

 5. Also decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-sixth 

session the item entitled “Developments in the field of information and 

telecommunications in the context of international security”.
