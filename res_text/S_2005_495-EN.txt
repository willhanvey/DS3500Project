8 October 2004, and the relevant statements of its President,

Reaffirming that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of
the most serious threats to peace and security and that any acts of terrorism are
criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivations, whenever and by
whomsoever committed; and reiterating its unequivocal condemnation of Al-Qaida,
Usama bin Laden, the Taliban — and associated individuals, groups, undertakings
and entities — for ongoing and multiple criminal terrorist acts aimed at causing the
death of innocent civilians and other victims, destruction of property and greatly
undermining stability,

Expressing its concern over the use of various media, including the Internet,
by Al-Qaida, Usama bin Laden, and the Taliban, and their associates, including for
terrorist propaganda and inciting terrorist violence, and urging the working group
established pursuant to resolution 1566 (2004) to consider these issues,

Reaffirming the need to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter
of the United Nations and international law, threats to international peace and
security caused by terrorist acts, stressing in this regard the important role the
United Nations plays in leading and coordinating this effort,

Emphasizing the obligation placed upon all Member States to implement, in
full, resolution 1373 (2001), including with regard to the Taliban or Al-Qaida, and
any individuals, groups, undertakings or entities associated with Al-Qaida, Usama
bin Laden or the Taliban, who have participated in financing, planning, facilitating,
recruiting for, preparing, perpetrating, or otherwise supporting terrorist activities or
acts, as well as to facilitate the implementation of counter-terrorism obligations in
accordance with relevant Security Council resolutions,

Stressing the importance of clarifying which individuals, groups, undertakings
and entities are subject to listing in light of information regarding the changing

Welcoming the efforts of the International Civil Aviation Organization to prevent
travel documents from being made available to terrorists and their associates,

particular through the use of the Interpol database of stolen and lost travel
documents, to reinforce the implementation of the measures against Al-Qaida,
Usama bin Laden, and the Taliban, and their associates,

Expressing its concern over the possible use by Al-Qaida, Usama bin Laden,
or the Taliban, and their associates of Man-Portable Air Defence Systems
(MANPADS), commercially available explosives and chemical, biological, radiation
or nuclear weapons and material, and encouraging Member States to consider
possible action to reduce these threats,
