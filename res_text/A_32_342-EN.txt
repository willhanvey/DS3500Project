Reaffirming the solemn obligation of the administering Powers under the
Charter of the United Nations to promote the political, economic, social and
educational advancement of the inhabitants of the Territories under their
administration and to protect the human and natural resources of those Territories
against abuses,

ReaFfirming that any economic or other activity which impedes the implementation
of the Declaration and obstructs efforts aimed at the elimination of colonialism,
apartheid and racial discrimination in southern Africa and other colonial
Territories violates the political, economic and social Tights and interests of the
peoples of the Territories and is therefore incompatible with the purposes and
principles of the Charter,

Affirming that the natural resources of all colonial Territories, particularly
Zimbabwe and Namibia, are the heritage of the peoples of those Territories, and
that the exploitation of those resources by foreign economic interests in
conjunction with the illegal racist minority regimes constitutes a direct violation
of the rights of the inhabitants and of the principles stated in the Charter and
all relevant resolutions of the United Nations,

Noting with profound concern that the colonial Powers and certain States,
through their activities in the colonial Territories, have contLlued to disregard
United Nations decisions relating to the item and that they have failed to
implement in pa:cticuh,r General Assenbly resolutions 2621 (XXV) of 12 October 1970
and 31/7 of 5 November 1976, by which the Assembly called upon the colonial P01fers
and those Governments which had not yet done so to take legislative, administrative
or ether measures in order to put an end to enterprises in colonial Territories,
particularly in Africa, which are m.rued by their nationals or bodies corporate
'_Lnd.er their jurisdiction, "-,vhenever such enterprises are detrimental to the
interests of the inhabitants of those Territories, and to prevent new investments
which run counter to such interests,

CondeIDning the intensified activities of those foreign economic, financial and
other interests which continue to exploit the natural and human resources of the
colonial Territories and to accumulate and repatriate huge profits to the detriment
of the interests of the inhabitants, particularly in southern Africa, thereby
impeding the realization by the peoples of the Territories of their legitimate
aspirations for self-determination and independence,

Strongly condemning the support which the racist minority regime of
South Africa and the illegal racist minority regime in Southern Rhodesia continue to

receiv~ from those foreign economic~ financial and other interests which are
collaborating with them in their exploitation of the natural and human resources
of, and in the further entrenchment of their illegal and racialist domination
over, the international Territory of Famibia and the non-Belf-Governing Territory
of Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), respectively,

Strongly condemninp, the investment of foreign capital in the illegal
production of uranium and the collaboration by certain "~stern countries and other
States with the racist minority regime of South Africa in the nuclear field which,
by providing that regime ,dth nucleEr eQuipment and technology, enables the latter
to develop nuclear and military capabilities, thereby promoting South Africa's
continued illegal occupation of Namibia as veIl as its growth as a nuclear Pm'Ter,

Deeply concerned at the fact that foreign economic, financial and other
interests continue to deprive the indigenous populations of other colonial
Territories, including those in the Caribbean and Pacific Ocean regions, of their
rights over the wealth of their countries, and at the continued loss of ownership
of land by the inhabitants of the Territories as a result of the failure of the
adr~nistering Powers to take effective steps to safeguard such ownership,

Conscious of the continued need to mobilize world public opinion against the
involvement of foreign economic, financial and other interests in the exploitation of
natural and human resources, which impedes the independence of colonial Territories,
particularly in Africa,

1. Reaffirms the inalienable right of the peoples of dependent Territories
to self··determination and independence and to the enj oyment of the natural
resources of their Territories, as well as their right to dispose of those
resources in their best interests~

the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia and Programme of Action for the Liberation of
Zimbabwe and Namibia adopted by the International Conference in Support of the

as the Lagos Declaration for Action against Apartheid adopted by the World
Conference for Action against Anartheid on 26 August 1977;

3. Reiterates that any administering or occupying Power which deprives the
colonial peoples of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural
resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign
economic and financial interests violates the solerrn obligations it has assumed
under the Charter of the United Rations;

4. Reaffirms that, by their depletive exploitation of natural resources,
the continued accumulation and repatriation of huge profits and the use of those
profits for the enrichment of foreign settlers and the entrenchment of colonial
domination over the Territories) the activities of foreign economic, financial and
other interests operating at present in the colonial Territories of southern
Africa constitute a major obstacle to political independence and to the enjoyment
of the natural resources of those Territories by the indigenous inhabitants;
