Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 6

 Recalling the report of the independent international commission of inquiry 

established pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution S-28/1,8

humanitarian law conventions, as well as other international treaties,  

 Stressing the urgency of bringing a complete end to the Israeli occupation that 

began in 1967, and an end to the violation of the human rights of the Palestinian

their right to self-determination and their independent State, leading to a peaceful, 

just, lasting and comprehensive solution for the question of Palestine,

accordance with its obligations as a State Member of the United Nations, with the 

Special Committee in implementing its mandate, and regrets the continued lack of 

cooperation in this regard;
