scourge of war and putting emphasis on preventive diplomacy, mediation and good 

offices, peacekeeping, peacebuilding, and sustaining peace, 

 Reaffirming the important and positive contribution youth can make to the 

efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security, prevention and 

resolution of conflicts and as a key aspect of the sustainability, inclusiveness and 

success of peacekeeping and peace building efforts,  

 Recognizing that today’s generation of youth is the largest the world has ever 

known and that young people often form the majority of the population of countries 

affected by armed conflict, 

 Noting that the term youth is defined in the context of this resolution as persons 

of the age of 18–29 years old, and further noting the variations of definition of the 

term that may exist on the national and international levels, including the definition  

of youth in the General Assembly Resolutions A/RES/50/81 and A/RES/56/117, 

 Bearing in mind the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations 

and the primary responsibility of the Security Council under the Charter for the 

maintenance of international peace and security,  

 Expressing concern that among civilians, youth account for many of those 

adversely affected by armed conflict, including as refugees and internally displaced 

persons, and that the disruption of youth’s access to quality education and economic 

opportunities has a dramatic impact on durable peace and reconciliation,  

 Recognizing that youth should actively be engaged in shaping lasting peace and 

contributing to justice and reconciliation, and that a large youth population presents 

a unique demographic dividend that can contribute to lasting peace and economic 

prosperity if inclusive policies are in place,  

 Recognizing that the protection of all youth, particularly young women, refugees 

and internally displaced youth in armed conflict and post-conflict and their 

participation in peace processes can significantly contribute to the maintenance and 

promotion of international peace and security, and should be an important component 

of any comprehensive strategy to resolve conflict and build peace,  

 Emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive approach to peacebuilding and 

sustaining peace, particularly through the prevention of conflict and addressing its 

root causes at all stages of conflict,  

 Reaffirming the primary responsibility of national governments and authorities 

in identifying, driving and directing priorities, strategies and activities for 

peacebuilding and sustaining peace and that inclusivity, including by ensuring full, 

effective and meaningful participation of youth without discrimination of any kind, 

such as race, color, sex, language, disability, religion or belief, political or other 

opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status is key to advancing 

peacebuilding processes and objectives in order to ensure that the needs of all 

segments of society are taken into account,  

 Reiterating the important role youth can play as agents of change in countering 

terrorism and violent extremism conducive to terrorism,  

 Recognizing that core challenges still remain, including structural barriers that 

limit the participation and capacity of young people, especially young women, to 

influence decision making, violations of their human rights, and insufficient 

investment in facilitating inclusion, particularly through quality education,  

 Recognizing the significance of the fifth anniversary of resolution 2250 (2015), 

the twentieth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000),the review of the United Nations 

peacebuilding architecture, the launch of the Decade of Action and delivery for

Fourth World Conference on Women and the seventy fifth anniversary of the United 

Nations, and the 5th anniversary since the adoption of the Sustainable Development 

Goals offering a prime opportunity to highlight the invaluable role of young people 

and to amplify their voices and perspectives in shaping the world and its future,  

 Acknowledging the on-going work of national governments and regional and 

international organisations to engage youth in building and maintaining peace,  

 Recognizing the importance of civil society, including community-based civil 

society, youth, women, peacebuilders, and where relevant the private sector, 

academia, think tanks, media, and cultural, educational, and religious leaders in peace 

building efforts and sustaining peace, including by increasing awareness about threats 

of terrorism and more effectively tackling them, 

 Taking note with appreciation of the United Nations Youth 2030 Strategy of the 

Secretary-General which provides a road map for the United Nations system, 

including a specific priority on peacebuilding and resilience-building, directly aligned 

with resolutions 2250 (2015) and 2419 (2018), 

 Recognizing the challenges faced by youth, especially by young women, which 

put them at particular risk, including gender inequalities that perpetuate all forms of 

discrimination and violence and emphasizing that advancing gender equality and 

empowerment of women is critical for the full, equal and effective participation of 

women at all stages of peace processes given their vital role in the prevention and 

resolution of conflict and peacebuilding, reaffirming the key role women can play in 

re-establishing the fabric of recovering society and in the development and 

implementation of post-conflict strategies in order to take into account their 

perspectives and needs, 

 Reaffirming the right to education and its contribution to the achievement of 

peace and security and further recognizing that investment in universal, and inclusive 

education and training is an important policy investment that States can make to 

ensure the immediate and long-term development of youth, and reiterating that access 

to inclusive, equitable and quality formal and non-formal education are important 

factors that enable youth to acquire the relevant skills and to build their capacities,  

 Taking note of the first report of the Secretary-General of 2 March 2020 

(S/2020/167) and its recommendations, and noting the independent Progress Study 

on Youth, Peace and Security, “The missing peace”, 

 1. Calls on all relevant actors, to consider ways to increase the inclusive 

representation of youth for the prevention and resolution of conflict, as well as in

their marginalization is detrimental to building sustainable peace;  

 2. Reaffirms states’ obligation to respect, promote and protect human rights 

and fundamental freedoms of all individuals, including youth, and ensure equal access
