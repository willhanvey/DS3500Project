  Australia, France, Luxembourg, United Kingdom of Great  
Britain and Northern Ireland and United States of America:  
draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions and statements of its President concerning 
Sudan, 

 Reaffirming its commitment to the cause of peace throughout Sudan, to the 
sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Sudan, to the full and 
timely implementation of resolution 1591 (2005) and recalling the importance of the 
principles of good neighbourliness, non-interference and cooperation in the relations 
among States in the region, 

 Recognizing that the Darfur conflict cannot be resolved militarily and a 
durable solution can only be obtained through an inclusive political process, 

 Reiterating its full support for efforts to reach a comprehensive and inclusive 
solution to the conflict in Darfur, welcoming the Doha Document for Peace in 
Darfur as a basis for these efforts, and reiterating the need for the completion of the 
political process, and an end to the violence and abuses in Darfur, 

 Urging the Government of Sudan and the Liberation and Justice Movement 
(LJM) to deliver on the commitments made in the Doha Document for Peace in 
Darfur, and urging all parties, in particular other armed movements who have not 
signed the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur, to engage immediately and without 
preconditions and to make every effort to reach a comprehensive peace settlement 
on the basis of the DDPD, and to agree upon a permanent ceasefire without further 
delay, 

 Expressing concern about the political and military links between 
non-signatory armed groups in Darfur and groups outside Darfur, and demanding 
that any form of direct or indirect external support for such groups ceases, and 
condemning any actions by any armed group aimed at forced overthrow of the 
Government of Sudan, 

 Demanding that the parties to the conflict exercise restraint and cease military 
action of all kind, including aerial bombardments, 

 Demanding an immediate and complete cessation by all parties to armed 
conflict of all acts of sexual violence against civilians in line with resolutions 1325 
(2000), 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009), and 1889 (2009); recruitment and use of children 



S/2013/92  
 

13-23388 2 
 

and other grave violations and abuses against children in line with resolutions 1612 
(2005), 1882 (2009), 1998 (2011) and 2068 (2012); and indiscriminate attacks on 
civilians in line with resolution 1894 (2009), 

 Commending the efforts of, and reiterating its full support for, the United 
Nations/African Union Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID), the Joint African 
Union/United Nations Mediation, the United Nations Secretary-General, the African 
Union High Level Implementation Panel on Sudan, and the leaders of the region to 
promote peace and stability in Darfur, and expressing strong support for the political 
process under the African Union/United Nations-led mediation, 

 Deploring the continued obstacles that have been imposed by the Government 
of Sudan on the work of the Panel of Experts during the course of its mandate, 
including delays in the issuance of visas, restrictions to the freedom of movement of 
the Panel of Experts and UNAMID, and limitations on the Panel of Experts’ access 
to areas of armed conflict and reported violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law, while noting the improved interaction between the Focal Point of 
the Government of Sudan and the Panel of Experts,  

 Further deploring the three incidents of interference by the Government of 
Sudan with the work of the Panel of Experts, as set out in paragraphs 20 to 24 of the 
Final Report of the Panel of Experts (S/2013/79),  

 Welcoming the enhanced cooperation and information sharing between 
UNAMID and the Panel of Experts, called for by the Department of Peacekeeping 
Operations’ guidelines and with the assistance of the UNAMID focal point, 

 Recalling the 24 January 2013 Final Report by the Panel of Experts appointed 
by the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 3 (b) of resolution 1591 (2005) and 
extended by subsequent resolutions, and expressing its intent to further study, 
through the Committee, the Panel’s recommendations and to consider appropriate 
next steps, 

 Emphasizing the need to respect the provisions of the Charter concerning 
privileges and immunities, and the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of 
the United Nations, as applicable to United Nations operations and persons engaged 
in such operations, 

 Reminding all States, particularly States in the region, of the obligations 
contained in resolutions 1556 (2004), 1591 (2005), and 1945 (2010) in particular 
those obligations relating to arms and related materiel, 

 Stressing the necessity articulated in the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur 
that all Parties to the armed conflict in Darfur shall fully and unconditionally accept 
their obligations under international humanitarian law, international human rights 
law, and relevant Security Council resolutions, 

 Calling on the Government of Sudan to fulfil all its commitments, including 
lifting the state of emergency in Darfur, allowing free expression and undertaking 
effective efforts to ensure accountability for serious violations of international 
human rights and humanitarian law, by whomsoever perpetrated, 

 Emphasizing the imperative, highlighted in the Doha Document for Peace in 
Darfur, for all armed actors to refrain from all acts of violence against civilians, in 
particular vulnerable groups such as women and children, and from violations of 



 S/2013/92
 

3 13-23388 
 

human rights and international humanitarian law and the need to address the urgent 
humanitarian crisis faced by the people of Darfur, including the guarantee of safe, 
timely and unrestricted humanitarian access to all areas by humanitarian agencies 
and personnel, 

 Noting that acts of hostility, violence or intimidation against the civilian 
population, including IDPs, in Darfur and other activities that could endanger or 
undermine the Parties’ commitment to a complete and durable cessation of 
hostilities would be inconsistent with the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur, 

 Determining that the situation in Sudan continues to constitute a threat to 
international peace and security in the region, 

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 

 1. Decides to extend until 17 February 2014 the mandate of the Panel of 
Experts, originally appointed pursuant to resolution 1591 (2005) and previously 
extended by resolutions 1651 (2005), 1665 (2006), 1713 (2006), 1779 (2007), 1841 
(2008), and 1891 (2009), 1945 (2010), 1982 (2011) and 2035 (2012) and requests 
the Secretary-General to take the necessary administrative measures, including 
basing arrangements, as expeditiously as possible; 

 2. Expresses its concern that the direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer to 
Sudan of technical assistance and support, including training, financial or other 
assistance and the provision of spare parts, weapons systems and related materiel, 
could be used by the Government of Sudan to support military aircraft being used in 
violation of resolutions 1556 (2005) and 1591 (2005), including those aircraft 
identified by the panel, and urges all States to be mindful of this risk in light of the 
measures contained in resolution 1591 (2005);  

 3. Requests the Panel of Experts to provide no later than 31 July 2013, a 
midterm briefing on its work and no later than 90 days after the adoption of this 
resolution an interim report to the Committee established pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) 
of resolution 1591 (2005) (hereinafter “the Committee”) and a final report no later 
than 30 days prior to termination of its mandate to the Council with its findings and 
recommendations; 

 4. Requests the Panel of Experts to provide monthly updates to the 
Committee regarding its activities, including Panel travel, any obstacles encountered 
to the fulfilment of its mandate, as well as violations of the sanctions; 

 5. Requests the Panel of Experts to report, in the time frame identified in 
paragraph 3, on the implementation and effectiveness of paragraph 10 of resolution 
1945 (2010); 

 6. Requests the Panel of Experts to continue to coordinate its activities as 
appropriate with the operations of the United Nations/African Union Hybrid 
Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) and with international efforts to promote the 
political process in Darfur, and to assess in its interim and final reports progress 
towards reducing violations by all parties of the measures imposed by paragraphs 7 
and 8 of resolution 1556 (2005), paragraph 7 of resolution 1591 (2005), and 
paragraph 10 of resolution 1945 (2010), progress towards removing impediments to 
the political process, threats to stability in Darfur and the region, violations of 
international humanitarian or human rights law or other atrocities, including sexual 
and gender-based violence and grave violations and abuses against children, and 



S/2013/92  
 

13-23388 4 
 

other violations of the above-mentioned resolutions, and to provide the Committee 
with information on the individuals and entities that meet the listing criteria in 
paragraph 3 (c) of resolution 1591;  

 7. Regrets that some individuals affiliated with the Government of Sudan 
and armed groups in Darfur, continue to commit violence against civilians, impede 
the peace process, and disregard the demands of the Council, expresses its intention 
to impose targeted sanctions against individuals and entities that meet the listing 
criteria in paragraph 3 (c) of resolution 1591 (2005), and encourages the Panel of 
Experts, in coordination with the Joint African Union/United Nations Mediation, to 
provide to the Committee when appropriate the names of any individuals, groups, or 
entities that meet the listing criteria; 

 8. Requests the Panel of Experts to continue to investigate the role of armed, 
military, and political groups in attacks against UNAMID personnel in Darfur, and 
notes that individuals and entities who plan, sponsor or participate in such attacks 
constitute a threat to stability in Darfur and may therefore meet the designation 
criteria provided for in paragraph 3 (c) of resolution 1591 (2005); 

 9. Expresses its concern that certain items continue to be converted for 
military purposes and transferred to Darfur, and urges all States to be mindful of this 
risk in light of the measures contained in resolution 1591 (2005); 

 10. Calls on the Government of Sudan to remove all restrictions, limitations 
and bureaucratic impediments imposed on the work of the Panel of Experts, 
including by issuing timely multiple-entry visas to all members of the Panel of 
Experts for the duration of its mandate, and by waiving the requirement of Darfur 
travel permits for said Panel members; 

 11. Urges the Government of Sudan to respond to the Committee’s requests 
on measures put in place to protect civilians in various parts of Darfur, including 
those affected by new displacements; investigations conducted and accountability 
measures undertaken for killings of civilians and perpetrators of human rights 
abuses and violations of international humanitarian law, including notably the 
killings of civilians in Abu Zereiga in June 2011, Hashaba in August 2012 and Sigili 
in November 2012; investigations conducted and accountability measures 
undertaken for attacks against peacekeepers and humanitarian personnel; and the 
situation of civilian populations in areas such as eastern Jebel Marra, where the 
Panel of Experts, UNAMID and humanitarian agencies and personnel have been 
denied access, and measures taken to allow unimpeded and regular access for 
humanitarian relief to these areas; 

 12. Urges all States, relevant United Nations bodies, the African Union and 
other interested parties, to cooperate fully with the Committee and the Panel of 
Experts, in particular by supplying any information at their disposal on

1556 (2004);  

 13. Urges all States, in particular those in the region, to report to the 
Committee on the actions they have taken to implement measures imposed by 
resolutions 1591 (2005) and 1556 (2004), including imposition of targeted measures; 

 14. Expresses its concern that the travel ban and asset freeze on designated 
individuals is not being implemented by all Member States, and requests the 



 S/2013/92
 

5 13-23388 
 

Committee to respond effectively to any reports of non-compliance by Member 
States with paragraph 3 of resolution 1591 (2005) and resolution 1672 (2006), 
including by engaging with all relevant parties; 

 15. Expresses its intention, following the midterm report, to review the state

ensuring full compliance;
