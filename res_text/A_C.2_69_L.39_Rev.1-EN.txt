voluntary and grant nature, their neutrality and their multilatera lism, as well as their 

ability to respond to the development needs of programme countries in a flexible 

manner, and that the operational activities are carried out for the benefit of 

programme countries, at the request of those countries and in accordance with their 

own policies and priorities for development,  

 Affirming that the operational activities for development of the United Nations 

system should provide a key contribution to the implementation of the ambitious 

and transformational objectives of the post-2015 development agenda, once 

adopted, and should therefore be improved, including the ability of the United 

Nations development system, in line with its mandate, to assist countries in 

responding to the challenges of sustainable development,

 6. Reaffirms the importance of the contribution of operational activities for 

development to national capacity development and development effectiveness of the 

United Nations development system in addressing the key areas identified in the 

quadrennial comprehensive policy review, in this regard recalls its request to the 

entities of the United Nations development system to develop, for the consideration 

of Member States, a common approach for measuring progress in capacity 

development, including measures to ensure sustainability, as well as to develop, in a 

manner consistent with their mandates, specific frameworks aimed at enabling 

programme countries, upon their request, to design, monitor and evaluate results in 

the development of their capacity to achieve national development goals and 

strategies, and invites the Secretary-General to provide comprehensive and 

evidence-based updates on measures taken in this regard in his 2015 annual report 

on the implementation of resolution 67/226; 

 7. Requests the funds and programmes of the United Nations development 

system, and invites specialized agencies, to consider the findings and observations 

related to national capacity gaps repeatedly highlighted by programme countries to 

be addressed through the work of the operational activities for development of the 

United Nations system, including through the strengthening and use of national 

capacities, and to report to their governing bodies in 2015 with recommendations 

for implementation in this regard; 

 8. Reiterates that core resources, because of their untied nature, continue to 

be the bedrock of the operational activities for development of the United Nations 

system, and in this regard recognizes the need for organizations to address, on a 

continuous basis, the imbalance between core and non-core resources and to report 

to the Economic and Social Council in 2015, as part of their regular reporting, on 

the measures taken to address this imbalance; 

 9. Notes with concern that the percentage of core resources in the overall 

funding for operational activities has declined, also notes that non-core resources 

represent an important contribution to the overall resource base of the United 

Nations development system and complement core resources in supporting 

operational activities for development, thus contributing to an increase in total 

resources, while noting the need to make non-core resources more flexible and 

aligned with strategic plans and national priorities, and recognizes that non-core 

resources are not a substitute for core resources, and that they pose challenges, in 

particular restricted earmarked funding such as single-donor project-specific 

funding, by potentially increasing transaction costs, fragmentation, competition and 

overlap among entities and providing disincentives for pursuing a system-wide 

focus, strategic positioning and coherence, and may also potentially distort 

programme priorities regulated by intergovernmental bodies and processes;  

 10. Welcomes the progress made by the United Nations funds, programmes 

and specialized agencies in ensuring that available and projected core and non -core 

resources are consolidated within an integrated budgetary framework, based on the 

priorities of their respective strategic plans, and encourages all agencies that  have 

not already done so to develop such integrated frameworks in their next budget 

cycle; 

 11. Recalls the concern expressed in its resolutions 67/226 and 68/229 of 

20 December 2013 over the lack of progress in the development and 

operationalization of the concept of “critical mass” of core resources, while noting 



A/C.2/69/L.39/Rev.1 
 

 

14-66746 4/6 

 

the adoption in 2014 by the Executive Board of the United Nations Development 

Programme, the United Nations Population Fund and the United Nations Office for 

Project Services of decisions 2014/24 and 2014/25 and the adoption by the 

Executive Board of the United Nations Children’s Fund of decision 2014/17, in 

which they noted common principles for the concept of critical mass of resources 

and core resources as developed by United Nations funds and programmes and 

requested the funds and programmes to develop and present resource mobilization 

strategies for the consideration of their Executive Boards in 2015;  

 12. Stresses the need to avoid the use of core or regular resources to 

subsidize activities financed by non-core or extrabudgetary resources, reaffirms that 

the guiding principle governing the financing of all non-programme costs should be 

based on full cost recovery from core and non-core funding sources, proportionally, 

and in this regard notes the timelines agreed by the executive boards of the United 

Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Population Fund, the United 

Nations Children’s Fund and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the 

Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) for an independent and external assessment 

to be performed in 2016 of the consistency and alignment of the new cost -recovery 

methodology with the quadrennial comprehensive policy review;  

 13. Notes with appreciation the work undertaken by those entities of the 

United Nations development system that have made efforts to align their strategic 

plans, frameworks and budgets with the quadrennial comprehensive policy review, 

and encourages all entities of the United Nations development system that have not 

done so to take further steps in this regard;  

 14. Recognizes the importance of continuing to strengthen and improve the 

results-focused delivery of operational activities for development of the United 

Nations system in order to maximize their support for accelera ting progress towards 

achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, especially in the least 

developed countries and other developing countries that are lagging behind in 

meeting the targets, as well as their support for the elaboration of the post -2015 

development agenda; 

 15. Welcomes the integration of poverty eradication, as the overarching 

priority, into the strategic plans of some United Nations system organizations, in 

accordance with their mandates; 

 16. Reaffirms its call, in its resolution 67/226, for the organizations of the 

United Nations development system to assign the highest priority to the eradication 

of poverty, and in this regard acknowledges the request by the Economic and Social 

Council to the United Nations funds and programmes to include in their regular 

reporting to the Council information on steps taken, in accordance with their 

mandates, on the scaling up of efforts to address the root causes of extreme poverty 

and hunger, sharing of good practices, lessons learned, strategies, programmes and 

policies, inter alia, capacity-building, employment generation, education, vocational 

training, rural development and the mobilization of resources, which aim at 

achieving poverty eradication and promoting the active participation of those l iving 

in poverty in the design and implementation of such programmes and policies;  

 17. Requests all entities of the United Nations development system to 

consider the post-2015 development agenda, once adopted, in the context of 



 
A/C.2/69/L.39/Rev.1 

 

5/6 14-66746 

 

midterm reviews and the elaboration of strategic plans and frameworks, in order to 

ensure consistency and alignment with the agenda; 

 18. Recalls the requests contained in its resolution 67/226 on strengthening 

South-South cooperation, in this regard notes the progress made by some entities of 

the United Nations development system in mainstreaming South-South and 

triangular cooperation into their key policies, strategic frameworks, operational 

activities and budgets, and welcomes the recommendations and measures, as set out 

in decision 18/1 of the High-level Committee on South-South Cooperation,
7
 to 

strengthen South-South and triangular cooperation, including through improved 

allocation of resources across the United Nations development system, including the 

United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation; 

 19. Stresses that South-South cooperation is not a substitute for, but rather a 

complement to, North-South cooperation; 

 20. Recalls the policy for independent system-wide evaluation of United 

Nations operational activities for development, in this regard reaffirms the decision 

in its resolution 68/229 that two pilot independent system-wide evaluations should 

be conducted in 2014 on the themes set out therein, subject to the provision and 

availability of extrabudgetary resources, as outlined in the policy, in this regard 

notes with concern the lack of progress, and reiterates its invitation to countries in a 

position to do so to contribute additional extrabudgetary resources for the effective 

and accelerated implementation of the evaluations in 2015, and requests the interim 

coordination mechanism for system-wide evaluation of operational activities for 

development of the United Nations system to provide an update on progress in the 

implementation of the evaluations at the operational activities segment of the 

substantive session of 2015 of the Economic and Social Council;  

 21. Recognizes the need to review the composition and functioning of the 

governing structures of the United Nations funds and programmes, in this regard 

welcomes Economic and Social Council resolution 2014/14, and calls for early 

reforms of those governance structures; 

 22. Reaffirms the importance of achieving diversification in the composition 

of the resident coordinator system in terms of geographical distributio n and gender, 

also reaffirms the importance of the participation of all United Nations agencies, 

funds and programmes on an equal footing in the resident coordinator system, in 

this regard requests the Secretary-General to make every effort to ensure the full 

application of these principles in the appointment of resident coordinators, 

encourages all agencies to nominate qualified candidates for the resident coordinator 

assessment centre, and requests the United Nations development system to continue 

to identify solutions in order to strengthen its ability to efficiently recruit and deploy 

appropriately senior and experienced resident coordinators who meet the highest 

standards of integrity; 

 23. Welcomes the dialogues held at the operational activities segment of the 

Economic and Social Council of its substantive session of 2014 regarding the role of 

the United Nations development system in the changing development landscape and 

the need to align the United Nations system to address emerging challenges, in th is 

regard reaffirms the decision of the Council to convene a transparent and inclusive 

dialogue involving Member States and all relevant stakeholders on the longer -term 

positioning of the United Nations development system, with a view to tackling the 



A/C.2/69/L.39/Rev.1 
 

 

14-66746 6/6 

 

interlinkages between the alignment of functions, funding practices and governance
