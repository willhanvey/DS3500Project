concerning the International Tribunal, 

 Recalling also its resolution 1966 (2010) of 22 December 2010, establishing 
the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (“the Mechanism”) 
and requesting the International Tribunal to take all possible measures to 
expeditiously complete all its remaining work no later than 31 December 2014, 
prepare its closure and ensure a smooth transition to the Mechanism, 

 Recalling further that the branch of the Mechanism for the International 
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda shall commence functioning on 1 July 2012, 

 Taking note of the assessments by the International Tribunal in its Completion 
Strategy Report (S/2011/317), 

 Noting that, upon the completion of the cases to which they are assigned, four 
permanent judges will be redeployed from the Trial Chambers to the Appeals 
Chamber and two permanent judges will leave the International Tribunal, 

 Noting the concerns expressed by the President and Prosecutor of the 
International Tribunal about staffing, and reaffirming that staff retention is essential 
for the timely completion of the International Tribunal’s work, 

 Urging the International Tribunal to take all possible measures to complete its 
work expeditiously as requested in resolution 1966 (2010), 

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 

 1. Decides that, notwithstanding article 13, paragraph 1, and article 12 quater, 
paragraph 2 (a), of the Statute of the International Tribunal, ad litem judges may be 
eligible for election as, and may vote in the election of, the President of the 
International Tribunal; 



S/2011/410  
 

11-40224 2 
 

 2. Decides in this regard that, notwithstanding article 12 quater, paragraph 2, 
of the Statute of the International Tribunal, an ad litem judge elected as President of 
the International Tribunal may exercise the same powers as a permanent judge, 
which will not alter his or her status or give rise to any additional allowances or 
benefits other than those which already exist, and will effect no changes of the 
current terms and conditions of service as an ad litem judge; 

 3. Decides that, notwithstanding article 12 quater, paragraph 2, of the 
Statute of the International Tribunal, an ad litem judge elected as Vice President of 
the International Tribunal may act as President when required to do so by under the 
Statute or the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, which will not alter his or her status 
or give rise to any additional allowances or benefits other than those which already

note of the intention of the International Tribunal to complete the case by December 
2011; and underscores that this exceptional authorization shall not be considered as 
establishing a precedent. The President of the International Tribunal shall have the 
responsibility to ensure that this arrangement is compatible with the independence 
and impartiality of the judge, does not give rise to conflicts of interest and does not 
delay the delivery of the judgment; 

 5. Reaffirms the necessity of trial of persons indicted by the International 
Tribunal and reiterates its call on all States, especially the States of the Great Lakes

 6. Reiterates the importance of the International Tribunal being adequately 
staffed to complete its work expeditiously and calls upon relevant United Nations 
bodies to intensify cooperation with the Secretariat and the Registrar of the 
International Tribunal and to take a flexible approach in order to find practicable 
solutions to address this issue as the International Tribunal approaches the 
completion of its work, and at the same time calls upon the International Tribunal to 
renew its efforts to focus on its core functions; 

 7. Commends States that have accepted the relocation of acquitted persons 
or convicted persons who have completed serving their sentences to their territories, 
and calls upon other States in a position to do so to cooperate with and render all 
necessary assistance to the International Tribunal in the relocation of acquitted
