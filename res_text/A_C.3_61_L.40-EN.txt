Protocol to the Convention on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography,9 

 Recalling Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2003/14 of 17 April 2003, 
2004/14 of 15 April 2004 and 2005/13 of 14 April 2005, and Human Rights Council 
decision 1/102 of 30 June 2006, 

 Concerned that the 19 March 2006 presidential election was severely flawed 
and fell significantly short of Belarus Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe commitments to hold a free and fair election, and that the situation of human 
rights in Belarus in 2005 was steadily deteriorating, as documented in the final 
report of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the report of the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus,10 

 Noting that the Belarusian authorities have decided to hold local elections on 
14 January 2007, and expressing its hope that those would be free and fair, in full 
respect of international electoral standards, 

 1. Expresses deep concern: 

 (a) About the failure of the Government of Belarus to cooperate fully with 
all the mechanisms of the Human Rights Council, in particular with the special 
rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in Belarus, while noting the serious 
concern relating to the deterioration of the human rights situation in Belarus 
expressed by seven independent human rights experts of the United Nations in a 
statement issued on 29 March 2006; 

 (b) That in spite of detailed recommendations by the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe and dialogue between the Government and the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe following previous elections, 
Belarus again failed to meet its commitments to hold free and fair elections, 
including by allowing the arbitrary use of State power against opposition candidates, 
routine harassment, the detention and arrest of political and civil society activists, 
the obstruction of the access of opposition candidates to State media, the negative 
portrayal in the State media of opposition candidates and activists, including human 
rights defenders, and the serious shortcomings of the vote count that lacked 
minimum transparency; 

 (c) About continued reports of harassment, arbitrary arrest and detentions of 
up to 1,000 persons, including opposition candidates, before and after the 19 March 
2006 election; 

 (d) About the continued and expanding criminal prosecutions, lack of due 
process and closed political trials of leading opposition figures and human rights 
defenders; 

 (e) About the continued harassment and detention of Belarusian journalists 
covering local opposition demonstrations, and that senior officials of the 
Government of Belarus were implicated in the enforced disappearance and/or 
summary execution of three political opponents of the incumbent authorities in 1999 
and of a journalist in 2000 and in the continuing investigatory cover-up, as

documented in the report adopted in resolution 1371 of 28 April 2004 by the 
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe; 

 (f) About the decision of the Belarusian authorities to revoke the teaching 
licence of the European Humanities University in Minsk and to terminate the lease 
of its buildings, forcing the University in Belarus to close down; 

 (g) About persistent reports of harassment and closure of non-governmental 
organizations, national minority organizations, independent media outlets, religious 
groups, opposition political parties and independent trade unions, independent youth 
and student organizations, and the harassment and prosecutions of individuals, 
including students engaged in the promotion and protection of human rights, rule of 
law and democracy; 

 2. Urges the Government of Belarus: 

 (a) To bring the electoral process and legislative framework into line with 
international standards, especially those of the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, demonstrate such commitment through the upcoming local 
elections in January 2007 and rectify the shortcomings of the electoral process, 
identified by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights in its report 
of 7 June 2006, including election laws and practices that restrict campaigning 
opportunities for de facto opposition candidates, arbitrary application of electoral 
laws, including on registration of candidates, obstruction of the right of access to the 
media, biased presentation of the issues by the State media and falsification of vote 
counts; 

 (b) To cease politically motivated prosecution, harassment and intimidation 
of political opponents and pro-democracy activists and human rights defenders, 
students, independent media, religious organizations, educational institutions and 
civil society actors; and to cease the harassment of students and to create the 
conditions whereby they can continue their studies in Belarus; 

 (c) To respect the rights of freedom of speech, assembly and association and 
to release immediately all political prisoners and other individuals detained for 
exercising those rights; 

 (d) To suspend from their duties officials implicated in any case of enforced 
disappearance, summary execution and torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, pending investigation of those cases, and to 
ensure that all necessary measures are taken to investigate fully and impartially such 
cases and to bring the alleged perpetrators to justice before an independent tribunal, 
and if found guilty, to ensure that they are punished in accordance with the 
international human rights obligations of Belarus; 

 (e) To investigate and hold accountable those responsible for the 
mistreatment and detention of domestic and foreign journalists in connection with 
the 19 March 2006 election and post-election demonstrations; 

 (f) To uphold the right to freedom of religion or belief, including the ability 
to maintain communications with individuals and communities in matters of religion 
and belief at the national and international level; 

 (g) To investigate and hold accountable those responsible for the 
mistreatment, arbitrary arrest and incarceration of civic and political activists

leading up to and following the March 2006 presidential elections and to release 
immediately and unconditionally all political prisoners; 

 (h) To carry out all other steps called for by the Commission on Human 
Rights in its resolution 2005/13; 

 3. Insists that the Government of Belarus cooperate fully with all the 
mechanisms of the Human Rights Council, in particular with Commission on 
Human Rights resolution 2004/14 establishing the mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur appointed in Commission resolution 2005/13, as well as with the 
representative of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on 
freedom of the media.
