 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming its primary responsibility under the Charter of the United Nations 

for the maintenance of international peace and security,  

 Stressing that reforming the security sector in post-conflict environments is 

critical to the consolidation of peace and stability, promoting poverty reduction, rule 

of law and good governance, extending legitimate State authority, and preventing 

countries from relapsing into conflict, and further stressing that, in this regard, a 

professional, effective and accountable security sector and accessible and impartial 

law-enforcement and justice sectors are equally necessary to laying the foundations 

for peace and sustainable development,  

 Recalling the sovereign right and the primary responsibility of the country 

concerned to determine the national approach and priorities of security sector 

reform and recognizing that it should be a nationally owned process that is rooted in 

the particular needs and conditions of the country in question and encouraging the 

development of expertise in the field of security sector reform at the national level,  

 Recognizing that the political leadership and political will of national 

authorities are critical for the progress of security sector reform and reaffirming the 

lead role of national authorities in developing an inclusive national vision for 

security sector reform, coordinating the implementation of the vision, dedicating 

national resources towards national security institutions, and monitoring the impact 

of the security sector reform process, 

 Recalling the statements by its President of 21 February 2007 

(S/PRST/2007/3), 12 May 2008 (S/PRST/2008/14) and 12 October 2011 

(S/PRST/2011/19), and noting with appreciation the report of the Secretary-General

General Assembly, which have provided guidance to the United Nations Secretariat 

on the subject of security sector reform and the development of a United Nations 

approach to security sector reform,  

 Expressing concern at the range of challenges that weak and dysfunctional 

security institutions pose, including impairing the ability of the State to extend 

public security and rule of law within its boundaries, and noting that good 

governance and oversight of the security sector is important in ensuring that security 

institutions are capable of protecting the population, and further noting that failure 

to address operational and accountability deficits can undermine the positive gains 

of peacekeeping and necessitates the return of peacekeeping and special political 

missions in previous areas of operation and recognizing that effective security sector 

reform processes have been an important element of the stabilization and 

reconstruction of some post-conflict countries, 

 Reaffirming that an effective, professional and accountable security sector 

without discrimination and with full respect for human rights and the rule of law is 

the cornerstone of peace and sustainable development and is important for conflict 

prevention,  

 Recalling that the bulk of Security Council-mandated United Nations 

assistance in the area of security sector reform takes place in, and is directed to, 

countries in Africa and that a number of African countries are becoming important

 Noting the support provided by bilateral actors, as well as regional actors, 

including the European Union, to security sector reform efforts and other initiatives 

in the area of security sector reform, in particular in Africa, and stressing the 

importance of coordination as appropriate between the different actors involved in 

supporting security sector reforms through bilateral contributions and emphasiz ing 

the role United Nations peacekeeping operations or special political missions can 

play in enhancing this coordination, 

 Recognizing the centrality of security sector reform as a key element of 

peacekeeping and special political mission mandates, noting the increasing number 

and complexity of mission mandates on security sector reform, and emphasizing the 

importance of the United Nations, including through its peacekeeping operations 

and special political missions, supporting national Governments, upon their request 

where appropriate, to develop security institutions that are accessible and responsive 

to the needs of their population, and the important role of the Peacebuilding 

Commission and the Peacebuilding Fund in supporting security sector reform,  

 Recalling the important role that the United Nations has played in supporting 

national efforts to build sustainable security institutions, and commending the 

efforts of the United Nations, in particular the Department of Peacekeeping 

Operations, including the Security Sector Reform Unit and the United Nations 

Inter-Agency Security Sector Reform Task Force, in further strengthening a 

comprehensive United Nations approach to security sector reform, through the 

development of guidance and civilian capacities, coordination mechanisms, and

Country Team, as appropriate, and encouraging relevant United Nations entities 

mandated for security sector reform activities to work through the existin g 

coordination mechanisms, as appropriate, 

 Acknowledging the necessity for the United Nations to balance its support for 

the reform of individual components of the security sector, which in some contexts 

include defence, police, corrections, and border and immigration services, with 

sector-wide initiatives that address strategic governance, management and oversight 

aspects in order to ensure their long-term sustainability based on the particular 

needs and conditions of the country in question,  

 Reiterating the importance of the rule of law as one of the key elements of 

conflict prevention, peacekeeping, conflict resolution and peacebuilding and 

reiterating the statement by its President of 21 February 2014 (S/PRST/2014/5), and 

recalling that security sector reform must take place within a broad framework of 

the rule of law, and noting in this regard the contribution that effective, professional 

and accountable police services, that provide security to the population, can make in 

building trust between State authorities and communities and restoring the rule of 

law in post-conflict countries, 

 Reaffirming its commitment to address the impact of armed conflict on women

 Recognizing that security sector reform constitutes a key element of the 

political processes of States recovering from conflict and of the strengthening of the 

rule of law institutions,  

 Recognizing the interlinkages between security sector reform and other 

important factors of stabilization and reconstruction, such as, but not limited to, 

transitional justice, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration as well as long-

term rehabilitation of former combatants including in particular women and 

children, national small arms and light weapons management, arms embargo 

implementation, reduction of armed violence, organized crime and anti-corruption 

measures, protection of civilians, including in particular women and children, as 

well as gender equality and human rights issues,
