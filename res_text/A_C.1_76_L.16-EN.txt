 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its decision 75/517 of 7 December 2020 and relevant resolutions on 

the question, 

 Recognizing the abiding concern of all Member States for ensuring respect for 

the rights and obligations arising from treaties to which they are parties and from 

other sources of international law,  

 Convinced that observance by Member States of the Charter of the United 

Nations and compliance with non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament 

agreements to which they are parties and with other agreed obligations are essential 

for regional and global peace, security and stability, 

 Stressing that failure by States parties to comply with such agreements and with 

other agreed obligations not only adversely affects the security of States parties but 

also can create security risks for other States relying on the constraints and 

commitments stipulated in those agreements,  

 Stressing also that the viability and effectiveness of non-proliferation, arms 

limitation and disarmament agreements and of other agreed obligations require that 

those agreements be fully complied with and enforced, 

 Concerned by non-compliance by some States with their respective obligations,  



A/C.1/76/L.16  
 

 

21-14498 2/3 

 

 Noting that verification and compliance, and enforcement in a manner consistent 

with the Charter, are integrally related,  

 Recognizing the importance of and support for effective national, regional and 

international capacities for such verification, compliance and enforcement,  

 Recognizing also that full compliance by States with all their respective 

non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament agreements and with other agreed 

obligations they have undertaken contributes to efforts to prevent the development 

and proliferation, contrary to international obligations, of weapons of mass 

destruction, related technologies and means of delivery, as well as to e fforts to deny 

non-State actors access to such capabilities,  

 1. Underscores the contribution that compliance with non-proliferation, arms 

limitation and disarmament agreements and with other agreed obligations makes to 

enhancing confidence and to strengthening international security and stability;  

 2. Urges all States to implement and to comply fully with their respective 

obligations; 

 3. Welcomes efforts by all States to pursue additional areas of cooperation, 

as appropriate, that can increase confidence in compliance with existing 

non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament agreements and commitments and 

reduce the possibility of misinterpretation and misunderstanding;  

 4. Calls upon all States to include and empower women, including through 

capacity-building efforts, as appropriate, as full, equal and meaningful participants in 

the design and implementation of disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control 

efforts; 

 5. Calls upon all Member States to encourage and, for those States in a 

position to do so, to appropriately help States that request assistance to increase th eir 

capacity to implement fully their obligations;  

 6. Calls upon Member States to support efforts aimed at the resolution of 

compliance questions by means consistent with such agreements and other applicable 

international law; 

 7. Welcomes the role that the United Nations has played and continues to play 

in maintaining the integrity of certain arms limitation, disarmament and 

non-proliferation agreements and in addressing threats to international peace and 

security; 

 8. Calls upon all concerned States to take concerted action, in a manner 

consistent with relevant international law, to encourage, through bilateral and 

multilateral means, the compliance by all States with their respective 

non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament agreements and with other agreed 

obligations, and to hold those not in compliance with such agreements or obligations 

accountable for their non-compliance in a manner consistent with the Charter of the 

United Nations; 

 9. Urges those States not currently in compliance with their respective 

obligations and commitments to make the strategic decision to come back into 

compliance; 

 10. Encourages efforts by all States, the United Nations and other 

international organizations, pursuant to their respective mandates, to take action, 

consistent with the Charter, to prevent serious damage to international security and 

stability arising from non-compliance by States with their existing non-proliferation, 

arms limitation and disarmament obligations;  



 
A/C.1/76/L.16  

 

3/3 21-14498 

 

 11. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-ninth session, 

under the item entitled “General and complete disarmament”, the sub-item entitled 

“Compliance with non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament agreements 

and commitments”.
