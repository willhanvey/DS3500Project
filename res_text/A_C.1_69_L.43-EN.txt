 The General Assembly, 

 Guided by the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United 

Nations and the rules of international humanitarian law,  

 Recalling its resolutions 62/30 of 5 December 2007, 63/54 of 2 December 

2008, 65/55 of 8 December 2010 and 67/36 of 3 December 2012,  

 Determined to promote multilateralism as an essential means to carry forward 

negotiations on arms regulation and disarmament,  

 Taking note of the opinions expressed by Member States and relevant 

international organizations on the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions 

containing depleted uranium, as reflected in the reports submitted by the Secretary -

General pursuant to resolutions 62/30, 63/54, 65/55 and 67/36,1  

 Recognizing the importance of implementing, as appropriate, the 

recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations 

Environment Programme and the World Health Organization to mitigate potential 

hazards to human beings and the environment from the  contamination of territories 

with depleted uranium residues,  

 Considering that studies conducted so far by relevant international 

organizations have not provided a detailed enough account of the magnitude of the 

potential long-term effects on human beings and the environment of the use of 

armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium,

 Recalling that the United Nations Environment Programme, in its report to the 

Secretary-General on the subject,2 affirms that major scientific uncertainties persist 

regarding the long-term environmental impacts of depleted uranium, particularly 

with respect to long-term groundwater contamination, and calls for a precautionary 

approach to the use of depleted uranium,  

 Convinced that, as humankind becomes more aware of the need to take 

immediate measures to protect the environment, any event that could jeopardize 

such efforts requires urgent attention to implement the required measures,  

 Noting that further research should be done to assess the health risks and 

environmental impact of the use of arms and ammunitions containing depleted 

uranium in conflict situations, 

 Taking into consideration the potential harmful effects of the use of armaments 

and ammunitions containing depleted uranium on human health and the environment,  

 1. Expresses its appreciation to the Member States and international 

organizations that submitted their views to the Secretary-General pursuant to 

resolution 67/36 and previous resolutions on the subject;  

 2. Invites Member States and relevant international organizations, 

particularly those that have not yet done so, to communicate to the Secretary -

General their views on the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions 

containing depleted uranium; 

 3. Requests the Secretary-General to request relevant international 

organizations to update and complete, as appropriate, their studies and research on 

the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium 

on human health and the environment; 

 4. Encourages Member States, particularly the affected States, as necessary, 

to facilitate the studies and research referred to in paragraph 3 above;  

 5. Also encourages Member States to follow closely the development of the 

studies and research referred to in paragraph 3 above;  

 6. Invites Member States that have used armaments and ammunitions 

containing depleted uranium in armed conflicts to provide the relevant authorities of 

affected States, upon request, with information, as detailed as possible, about the 

location of the areas of use and the amounts used, with the objective of facilitating 

the assessment of such areas; 

 7. Encourages Member States in a position to do so to provide assistance to 

States affected by the use of arms and ammunitions containing depleted uranium, in 

particular in identifying and managing contaminated sites and material;  

 8. Requests the Secretary-General to submit an updated report on the 

subject to the General Assembly at its seventy-first session, reflecting the 

information submitted by Member States and relevant international organizations, 

including the information submitted pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 above;  

 9. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-first session, 

under the item entitled “General and complete disarmament”, the sub-item entitled 

“Effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium”.
