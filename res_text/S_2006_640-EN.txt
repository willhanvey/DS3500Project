 The Security Council, 

 Recalling all its previous resolutions on Lebanon, in particular resolutions 425 
(1978), 426 (1978), 520 (1982), 1559 (2004), 1655 (2006) 1680 (2006) and 1697 
(2006), as well as the statements of its President on the situation in Lebanon, in 
particular the statements of 18 June 2000 (S/PRST/2000/21), of 19 October 2004 
(S/PRST/2004/36), of 4 May 2005 (S/PRST/2005/17), of 23 January 2006 
(S/PRST/2006/3) and of 30 July 2006 (S/PRST/2006/35), 

 Expressing its utmost concern at the continuing escalation of hostilities in 
Lebanon and in Israel since Hizbollah’s attack on Israel on 12 July 2006, which has 
already caused hundreds of deaths and injuries on both sides, extensive damage to 
civilian infrastructure and hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons, 

 Emphasizing the need for an end of violence, but at the same time emphasizing 
the need to address urgently the causes that have given rise to the current crisis, 
including by the unconditional release of the abducted Israeli soldiers, 

 Mindful of the sensitivity of the issue of prisoners and encouraging the efforts 
aimed at urgently settling the issue of the Lebanese prisoners detained in Israel, 

 Welcoming the efforts of the Lebanese Prime Minister and the commitment of 
the Government of Lebanon, in its seven-point plan, to extend its authority over its 
territory, through its own legitimate armed forces, such that there will be no 
weapons without the consent of the Government of Lebanon and no authority other 
than that of the Government of Lebanon, welcoming also its commitment to a 
United Nations force that is supplemented and enhanced in numbers, equipment, 
mandate and scope of operation, and bearing in mind its request in this plan for an 
immediate withdrawal of the Israeli forces from southern Lebanon, 

 Determined to act for this withdrawal to happen at the earliest, 

 Taking due note of the proposals made in the seven-point plan regarding the 
Shebaa farms area, 

 Welcoming the unanimous decision by the Government of Lebanon on 
7 August 2006 to deploy a Lebanese armed force of 15,000 troops in South Lebanon 
as the Israeli army withdraws behind the Blue Line and to request the assistance of 
additional forces from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) as

term solution to the conflict, 

 Determining that the situation in Lebanon constitutes a threat to international
