  Draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council,  

 Welcoming the analysis on developments on the ground over the last six 
months in the report of the Secretary-General of 3 December 2007 (S/2007/699) on 
the United Nations operation in Cyprus, in accordance with his mandate, 

 Noting that the Government of Cyprus is agreed that in view of the prevailing 
conditions on the island it is necessary to keep UNFICYP beyond 15 December 
2007, 

 Echoing the Secretary-General’s firm belief that the responsibility of finding a 
solution lies first and foremost with the Cypriots themselves, that the upcoming year 
offers an important window of opportunity to make decisive progress, which must 
be grasped by all parties, in the search for a comprehensive solution, and noting the 
primary role of the United Nations in assisting the parties to bring the Cyprus 
conflict and division of the island to a comprehensive and durable settlement, 

 Taking note of the assessment of the Secretary-General that the security 
situation on the island and along the Green Line remains generally stable, 
welcoming the decrease in the overall number of incidents involving the two sides, 
and urging both sides to avoid any action which could lead to an increase in tension, 

 Underlining that activity in the buffer zone, in particular proposals for large-
scale commercial projects, which are not compatible with returning to normal 
conditions as expressed in the UNFICYP mandate, should not be at the expense of 
stability and security; reiterating the Secretary-General’s firm belief that the 
situation in the buffer zone would be improved if both sides accepted the 1989 aide-
memoire used by the United Nations, 

 Welcoming the principles and decisions enshrined in the 8 July 2006 
Agreement, stressing that a comprehensive settlement based on a bicommunal, 
bizonal federation and political equality, as set out in the relevant Security Council 
resolutions, is both desirable and possible and should not be further delayed, 

 Deploring the continued failure to date to implement the 8 July 2006 
Agreement, and urging the leaders of both communities to act to start the process 
without delay in order to prepare the ground for fully fledged negotiations leading to 
a comprehensive and durable settlement, 

 Welcoming the agreement to allow European Union funds to support demining 
activities; urging the rapid finalization of the protocol between the relevant parties 



S/2007/732  
 

07-64494 2 
 

governing the remaining demining activities in order to complete demining of the 
buffer zone, 

 Welcoming the progress and continuation of the important activities of the 
Committee on Missing Persons; expressing the hope that this process will promote 
reconciliation between the communities, 

 Welcoming the proposed confidence-building measures advanced by both 
sides, as a means of creating greater trust between the two communities and 
encouraging their early implementation; encouraging also progress on measures 
such as the opening of additional crossing points including, but not limited to, at 
Ledra Street, taking into account the arrangements already in place at existing 
crossing points, and reaffirming the importance of continued crossing of the Green 
Line by Cypriots, 

 Welcoming all efforts to promote bicommunal contacts and events, including, 
inter alia, on the part of all United Nations bodies on the island, urging the two sides 
to promote the active engagement of civil society and the encouragement of 
cooperation between economic and commercial bodies and to remove all obstacles 
to such contacts, 

 Agreeing that an active and flourishing civil society is essential to the political 
process and expressing concern, in this respect, that opportunities for constructive 
public debate about the future of the island, within and between the communities, 
are becoming fewer, and that this atmosphere is hampering, in particular, efforts to 
foster bicommunal activities intended to benefit all Cypriots, and to promote 
reconciliation and build trust in order to facilitate a comprehensive settlement, 

 Reaffirming the importance of the Secretary-General continuing to keep the 
operations of UNFICYP under close review while continuing to take into account 
developments on the ground and the views of the parties, and reverting to the 
Council with recommendations as appropriate for further adjustments to 
UNFICYP’s mandate, force levels and concept of operation as soon as warranted, 

 Welcoming the steps taken by the Republic of Cyprus to address the living 
conditions of many UNFICYP troops,  

 Echoing the Secretary-General’s gratitude to the Government of Cyprus and 
the Government of Greece for their voluntary contributions to the funding of 
UNFICYP, and his request for further voluntary contributions from other countries 
and organizations, 

 Welcoming and encouraging efforts by the United Nations to sensitize 
peacekeeping personnel in the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS and other 
communicable diseases in all its peacekeeping operations, 

 1. Welcomes the analysis on developments on the ground over the last six 
months in the Secretary-General’s report, in accordance with his mandate;

of a settlement, and that negotiations to reunify the island have been at an impasse 
for too long; 

 3. Expresses full support for the 8 July process, notes with deep concern the 
lack of any progress, and calls upon all parties immediately to engage constructively 
with the United Nations efforts, as described in Under-Secretary-General Gambari’s

3 07-64494 
 

letter of 15 November 2006 and to cease mutual recriminations; urges all parties to 
show flexibility and political will over the coming months to make measurable 
progress which will allow fully fledged negotiations to begin;

1251 (1999) of 29 June 1999 and subsequent resolutions; 

 5. Expresses its full support for UNFICYP and decides to extend its 
mandate for a further period ending 15 June 2008; 

 6. Calls on both sides to continue to engage, as a matter of urgency and 
while respecting UNFICYP’s mandate, in consultations with UNFICYP on the 
demarcation of the buffer zone, in particular in relation to the Ledra Street crossing 
point, and on the United Nations 1989 aide-memoire, with a view to reaching early 
agreement on outstanding issues; 

 7. Calls on the Turkish Cypriot side and Turkish forces to restore in 
Strovilia the military status quo which existed there prior to 30 June 2000; 

 8. Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report on implementation of 
this resolution by 1 June 2008; 

 9. Welcomes the efforts being undertaken by UNFICYP to implement the 
Secretary-General’s zero tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and to 
ensure full compliance of its personnel with the United Nations code of conduct, 
requests the Secretary-General to continue to take all necessary action in this regard 
and to keep the Security Council informed, and urges troop-contributing countries to 
take appropriate preventive action including the conduct of predeployment 
awareness training, and to take disciplinary action and other action to ensure full 
accountability in cases of such conduct involving their personnel; 

 10. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
