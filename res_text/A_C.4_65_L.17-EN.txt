emergency-related and development programmes, 

 Reiterating that the effective functioning of the United Nations Relief and 
Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East remains essential in all fields 
of operation, 

 Recognizing the need to maintain and extend the Agency’s management reform 
process in order to enable the Agency to effectively deliver services to the Palestine 
refugees, most efficiently utilize donor resources and reduce operational and 
administrative costs, and encouraging in this regard the Agency’s efforts to sustain 
change, 

 Recalling its resolution 3331 B (XXIX) of 17 December 1974, in which it 
decided that expenses for salaries of international staff in the service of the United 
Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East which 
would otherwise be a charge on voluntary contributions should be financed by the 
regular budget of the United Nations for the duration of the Agency’s mandate, 

 Recalling the recommendation of the Working Group at its extraordinary 
meeting in June 2009 that the General Assembly review, at its next session, the basis 
for its decision in resolution 3331 B (XXIX) to provide funding to the Agency for 
international posts so as to enable the Agency to meet contemporary demands from 
stakeholders and the Assembly itself,3 

 Stressing the need to continue supporting the institutional strengthening of the 
Agency, including the need to reinforce the Agency’s resource mobilization and 
advocacy capacities as well as the need for more predictable funding, through the 
provision of financial resources from the regular budget of the United Nations, in 
accordance with the requests made in its resolutions 64/89 of 10 December 2009 
and 65/100,

the strengthening of the management capacity of the United Nations Relief and 
Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East;4 

 2. Takes note of the grave financial situation faced by the Agency, including 
recurrent budgetary shortfalls due to underfunding and rising costs; 

 3. Calls upon the Agency to continue its management reform process in 
order to enhance its ability to raise and efficiently utilize resources, reduce 
operational and administrative costs, and implement change for more effective 
delivery of services to its beneficiaries;  

 4. Requests the Secretary-General to continue to support the institutional 
strengthening of the Agency through the provision of financial resources from the 
regular budget of the United Nations; 

 5. Stresses that approval of funding for the biennium 2012-2013 and for 
future bienniums, taking into consideration the recommendations in the report of the 
Secretary-General,4 is subject to justification in the context of the proposed 
programme budget for the relevant bienniums and consideration thereof by the 
General Assembly;

 6. Reiterates its appeal to all States, the specialized agencies and 
non-governmental organizations to continue and to increase their contributions to

the Agency’s valuable and necessary work in assisting the Palestine refugees in all 
fields of operation;

increase the support of traditional donors and to enhance income from non-traditional 
donors, including through partnerships with public and private entities;

sixty-seventh session on the progress made with regard to the implementation of the 
present resolution.
