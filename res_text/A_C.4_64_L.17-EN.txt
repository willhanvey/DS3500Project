Geneva Convention1 and relevant provisions of customary law, including those

 Recalling the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International

Occupied Palestinian Territory,4 and recalling also General Assembly resolutions 
ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004 and ES-10/17 of 15 December 2006,  

 Noting that the International Court of Justice concluded that “the Israeli 
settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have 
been established in breach of international law”,5  

 Taking note of the recent report of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights 
Council on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by

 Recalling also the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State solution to the

settlement activity, including so-called “natural growth”, and the dismantlement of

 Bearing in mind the detrimental impact of Israeli settlement policies, decisions

international humanitarian law, relevant United Nations resolutions and the 
agreements reached between the parties, and concerned particularly about Israel’s 
construction and expansion of settlements in and around occupied East Jerusalem, 
including its so-called E-1 plan that aims to connect its illegal settlements around 
and further isolate occupied East Jerusalem, the continuing demolition of 
Palestinian homes and eviction of Palestinian families from the city, and 
intensifying settlement activities in the Jordan Valley,

Israel of the wall inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around

East Jerusalem, and expressing its concern in particular about the route of the wall 
in departure from the Armistice Line of 1949, which is causing humanitarian 
hardship and a serious decline of socio-economic conditions for the Palestinian 
people, is fragmenting the territorial contiguity of the Territory, and could prejudge 
future negotiations and make the two-State solution physically impossible to 
implement,  

 Deeply concerned that the wall’s route has been traced in such a way as to 
include the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem,

East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan and any activities involving the

provocation, incitement and destruction,

provocation and incitement by illegal armed Israeli settlers in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, against Palestinian civilians and 
their properties and agricultural lands,  

 Noting the Israeli withdrawal from within the Gaza Strip and parts of the 
northern West Bank and the importance of the dismantlement of the settlements 
therein as a step towards the implementation of the road map, 

 Taking note of the relevant reports of the Secretary-General,9  

 Taking note also of the special meeting of the Security Council convened on 
26 September 2008,  

 1. Reaffirms that the Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territory, 
including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan are illegal and an 
obstacle to peace and economic and social development;  

 2. Calls upon Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the Geneva 
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 
12 August 1949,1 to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
and to the occupied Syrian Golan and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the 
Convention, in particular article 49;  

 3. Also calls upon Israel, the occupying Power, to comply strictly with its 
obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law, with 
respect to the alteration of the character, status and demographic composition of the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem;

harassment by Israeli settlers, especially against Palestinian civilians and their 
properties and agricultural lands, and stresses the need for the implementation of 
Security Council resolution 904 (1994), in which the Council called upon Israel, the 
occupying Power, to continue to take and implement measures, including 
confiscation of arms, aimed at preventing illegal acts of violence by Israeli settlers, 
and called for measures to be taken to guarantee the safety and protection of the 
Palestinian civilians in the occupied territory;
