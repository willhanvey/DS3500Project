responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, in order to 

prevent these crimes, avoid their recurrence and seek sustainable peace, justice, 

truth and reconciliation, and, in this regard, reaffirming the need to end impunity for 

serious violations of international humanitarian law, including those involving 

attacks against humanitarian personnel, 

 Stressing that the fight against impunity and to ensure accountability for 

genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other egregious crimes has been 

strengthened through the work on and prosecution of these crimes in the 

international criminal justice system, ad hoc and mixed tribunals as well as 

specialized chambers in national tribunals; and recognising in this regard the 

contribution of the International Criminal Court, in accordance with the principle of 

complementarity to national criminal jurisdictions as set out in the Rome Statute, 

towards holding accountable those responsible for such crimes, and reiterating its 

call on the importance of State cooperation with these courts and tribunals in 

accordance with the States’ respective obligations,  

 Recalling that the primary responsibility under international law for the 

security and protection of humanitarian personnel and United Nations and 

associated personnel lies with the Government hosting a United Nations operation 

conducted under the Charter of the United Nations or its agreements with relevant 

organizations,  

 Gravely concerned at the growing number of acts of violence in many parts of 

the world against national and international personnel of humanitarian 

organizations, United Nations personnel and its associated personnel, and 

humanitarian assets, including humanitarian supplies, facilities and transports, in 

particular deliberate attacks which are in violation of international humanitarian law, 

as well as other applicable international law and the adverse impact of such 

violence, including on humanitarian access, exacerbated by the presence of armed 

actors, including non-state armed groups, terrorist and criminal networks, and their 

activities,  

 1. Reaffirms the obligation of all parties involved in an armed conflict to 

comply with international humanitarian law, in particular their obligations under the 

Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the obligations applicable to them under the 

Additional Protocols thereto of 1977, to ensure the respect and protection of all 

humanitarian personnel and United Nations and associated personnel, as well as 

with the rules and principles of international human rights law and refugee law; 

 2. Strongly condemns all forms of violence and intimidation, including, 

inter alia, murder, rape and sexual assault, armed robbery, abduction, hostage -

taking, kidnapping, harassment and illegal arrest and detention to which those 

participating in humanitarian operations are increasingly exposed, as well as attacks 

on humanitarian convoys and acts of destruction and looting of their assets;  

 3. Urges all parties involved in an armed conflict to allow full unimpeded 

access by humanitarian personnel to all people in need of assistance, and to make 

available, as far as possible, all necessary facilities for their operations, and to 

promote the safety, security and freedom of movement of humanitarian personnel 

and United Nations and its associated personnel and their assets;  

 4. Urges States to ensure that crimes against humanitarian personnel do not 

remain unpunished, affirming the need for States to ensure that perpetrators of 



 
S/2014/640 

 

3/3 14-60168 

 

attacks committed on their territory against such personnel do not operate with 

impunity, and that perpetrators of such acts are brought to justice, as provided for by 

national laws and obligations under international law;  

 5. Reaffirms the obligation of all humanitarian personnel and United 

Nations and its associated personnel to observe and respect the laws of the country 

in which they are operating, in accordance with international law and the Charter of 

the United Nations, and underlines the importance for humanitarian organizations to 

uphold the principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence in their 

humanitarian activities; 

 6. Expresses its determination to take appropriate steps in order to ensure 

the safety and security of humanitarian personnel and United Nations and its 

associated personnel, including, inter alia, by:  

 (a) Ensuring that the mandates of relevant United Nations peacekeeping 

operations can, where appropriate and on a case-by-case basis, help to contribute to 

a secure environment to enable the delivery of humanitarian assistance by 

humanitarian organizations, in accordance with humanitarian principles;  

 (b) Requesting the Secretary-General to seek the inclusion of, and that host 

countries include, key provisions of the Convention on the Safety of United Nations 

and Associated Personnel, including, among others, those regarding the prevention 

of attacks against members of United Nations operations, the establishment of such 

attacks as crimes punishable by law and the prosecution or extradition of offenders, 

in future as well as, if necessary, in existing status-of-forces, status-of-missions and 

host country agreements negotiated between the United Nations and those countries, 

mindful of the importance of the timely conclusion of such agreements;  

 (c) Encouraging the Secretary-General, in accordance with his prerogatives 

under the Charter of the United Nations, to bring to the attention of the Security 

Council situations in which humanitarian assistance is unable to reach people in 

need as a consequence of violence directed against humanitarian personnel and 

United Nations and its associated personnel; 

 (d) Issuing the declaration of exceptional risk for the purposes of  

article 1 (c) (ii) of the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated 

Personnel, in situations where in its assessment circumstances would support such a 

declaration, and inviting the Secretary-General to advise the Security Council, 

where in his assessment circumstances would support such a declaration;  

 (e) Calling upon all States to consider becoming parties to the Convention 

on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel and its Optional Protocol, 

and urging States parties to take steps to enable its effective implementation;  

 7. Requests the Secretary-General to include in all his country-specific 

situation reports, and other relevant reports which address the protection of 

civilians, the issue of the safety and security of humanitarian personnel and United 

Nations and its associated personnel, including recording specific acts of violence 

against such personnel, remedial actions taken to prevent similar incidents and 

actions taken to identify and hold accountable those who commit such acts, and to 

provide the Security Council with recommendations on measures to prevent simi lar 

incidents, ensure accountability and enhance the safety and security of such 

personnel.
