Concerted international action for the elimination of apartheid

The General Assembly,

Alarmed by the critical situation in South Africa caused by the policy of
apartheid and in particular by the extension of the nation-wide state of emergency,

Convinced that the root-cause of the crisis in southern Africa is the policy
of apartheid,

Noting with grave concern that in order to perpetuate apartheid in South
Africa the authorities there have committed acts of aggression and breaches of the
peace,

Recognizing that the policy of bantustanization deprives the majority of the
people of their citizenship and makes them foreigners in their own country,

Noting that the so-called reforms in South Africa have had the effect of
further entrenching the apartheid system and further dividing the people of South
Africa,

Convinced that only the total eradication of apartheid and the establishment
of majority rule on the basis of the free and fair exercise of universal adult
sUffrage can lead to a peaceful and lasting solution in South Africa,

Convinced that broad-based negotiations involving the genuine representatives
of South Africa's majority population should be initiated immediately by the South
African authorities with a view to establishing a free, de~ocratic, united and
non-racial South Africa,

Recognizing the responsibility of the United Nations and the international
community to take all necessary action for the eradication of apartheid, and, in
particular, the need for effective pressure on the South African authorities as a
peaceful means of achieving the abolition of apartheid,

Encouraged, in this context, by the growing international consensus, as
demonstrated by the adoption of Security Council resolution 569 (1985) of
26 July 1985, and the increase. in and expansion of national, regional and
intergovernmental measures to this end,

Considering sanctions to be the most effective peaceful means available to the
international community to increase pressure on the South African authorities,

Convinced of the vital importance of the strict observance of Security Council
resolution 418 (1977) of 4 November 1977, by which the Council instituted a
mandatory arms embargo against South Africa, and Council resolution 558 (1984) of
13 December 1984 concerning the import of arms, ammunition and military vehicles
produced in South Africa, and of the need to make these embargoes fully effective
in conformity with Council resolution 591 (1986) of 28 November 1986,

Commending the national policies not to sell and export oil to South Africa,

Considering that measures to ensure effective and scrupulous implementation of
such embargoes through international co-operation are essential and urgent,

Noting, in this respect, the efforts undertaken by the Intergovernmental Group
to Monitor the Supply and Shipping of Oil and Petroleum Products to South Africa,

Noting with deep concern that, through a combination of military and economic
pressures, in violation of international law, the authorities of South Africa have
resorted to economic reprisals and aggression against, and destabilization of,
neighbouring States,

Alarmed by the deteriorating situation of millions of refugees, returnees and
displaced persons in southern Africa caused by these policies and actions,

Considering that contacts between apartheid South Africa and the front-line
and other neighbouring States, necessitated by geography, colonial legacy and other
reasons, should not be used by other States as a pretext for legitimizing the
apartheid system or justifying attempts to break the international isolation of
that system,

Convinced that the existence of apartheid will continue to lead to
ever-incr.easing resistance by the oppressed people, by all possible means, and

increased tension and conflict that will have far-reaching consequences for
southern Africa and the world,
