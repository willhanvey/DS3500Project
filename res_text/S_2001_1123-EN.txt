implementation beginning on 30 May 2002;

3. Reaffirms the obligation of all States, pursuant to resolution 661 (1990)
and subsequent relevant resolutions, to prevent the sale or supply to Iraq of any
commodities or products, including weapons or any other military equipment, and to
prevent the making available to Iraq of any funds or any other financial or economic
resources, except as authorized by existing resolutions;

and safety of all persons directly involved in their implementation;

5. Appeals to all States to continue to cooperate in the timely submission of
technically complete applications and the expeditious issuing of export licences, and
to take all other appropriate measures within their competence in order to ensure
that urgently needed humanitarian supplies reach the Iraqi population as rapidly as
possible;

6. Reaffirms its commitment to a comprehensive settlement on the basis of
the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, including any clarification
necessary for the implementation of resolution 1284 (1999);

Annex 2
Procedures

1. Applications for each export of commodities and products should be
forwarded to the Office of the Iraq Programme (OIP) by the exporting States
through permanent or observer missions, or by United Nations agencies and
programmes. Each application should include technical specifications and end-user
information in order for a determination to be made on whether the contract contains
any item referred to in paragraph 24 of resolution 687 (1991) or any item on the
Goods Review List (GRL). A copy of the concluded contractual arrangements
should be attached to the application.

2. Each application and the concluded contractual arrangements will be
reviewed by customs experts in the OIP and experts from UNMOVIC, consulting
the IAEA as necessary, in order to determine whether the contract contains any item
referred to in paragraph 24 of resolution 687 (1991) or included on the GRL. The
OIP will identify an official to act as a contact point on each contract.

3. In order to verify that the conditions set out in paragraph 2 above are
met, the experts may request additional information from the exporting States or
Iraq. The exporting States or Iraq should provide the additional information
requested within a period of 60 days. If the experts do not require any additional
information within four working days, the procedure under paragraphs 5, 6 and 7
below applies.

4. If the experts determine that the exporting State or Iraq has not provided
the additional information within the period set out in paragraph 3 above, the
application will not proceed further until the necessary information has been
provided.

5. If the UNMOVIC experts, consulting the IAEA as necessary, determine
that the contract contains any item referred to in paragraph 24 of resolution 687
(1991), the application shall be considered lapsed and returned to mission or agency
which submitted it.

6. If the UNMOVIC experts, consulting the IAEA as necessary, determine
that the contract contains any item referred to in the GRL, they will forward to the
Committee full details of the GRL listed items, including the technical
specifications of the items and the associated contract. In addition, OIP and
UNMOVIC, consulting the IAEA as necessary, shall provide to the Committee an
assessment of the humanitarian, economic and security implications, of the approval
or denial of the GRL listed items, including the viability of the whole contract in
which the GRL listed item appears and the risk of diversion of the item for military
purposes. OIP shall also provide information on the possible end-use monitoring of
such items. OIP will immediately inform the missions or agencies concerned. The
remaining items in the contract, which are determined as not included in the GRL,
will be processed according to the procedure in paragraph 7 below.

7. If the UNMOVIC experts, consulting the IAEA as necessary, determine
that the contract does not contain any item referred to in paragraph 2 above, the
Office of the Iraq Programme will inform immediately the Government of Iraq and
the exporting State in written form. The exporter will be eligible for payment upon
verification by Cotecna that the goods have arrived as contracted in Iraq.



14

S/2001/1123

8. If the mission or agency submitting a contract disagrees with the decision
to refer the contract to the Committee, it may appeal against this decision within two
business days to the Executive Director of OIP. In that event, the Executive Director
of OIP, in consultation with the Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC, will appoint
experts to reconsider the contract in accordance with the procedures set out above.
Their decision, endorsed by the Executive Director and Executive Chairman, will be
final and no further appeals will be permitted. The application shall not be
