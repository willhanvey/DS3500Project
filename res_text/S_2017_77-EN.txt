  France: draft resolution  
 

 

 The Security Council,  

 Recalling its previous resolutions and statements on the Central African 

Republic (CAR), in particular resolutions 2121 (2013), 2127 (2013), 2134 (2014), 

2149 (2014), 2181 (2014), 2196 (2015), 2212 (2015), 2217 (2015), 2262 (2016), 

2264 (2016), 2281 (2016), 2301 (2016) as well as resolution 2272 (2016), and the 

Statements of its President of 18 December 2014 (S/PRST/2014/28), 20 October 

2015 (S/PRST/2015/17), and 16 November 2016 (S/PRST/2016/17),  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 

territorial integrity of the CAR, and recalling the importance of the principles of 

non-interference, good-neighbourliness and regional cooperation,  

 Recalling that the CAR bears the primary responsibility to protect all 

populations within its territory from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and 

crimes against humanity,  

 Noting with concern that while improving, the security situation in the CAR 

remains fragile, due to the continued presence of armed groups and other armed 

spoilers, as well as the ongoing violence, the lack of capacity of the national 

security forces, the limited authority of the State over all of the CAR territory, and 

the persistence of the root causes of the conflict,  

 Emphasizing that any sustainable solution to the crisis in the CAR should be 

CAR-owned, including the political process, and should prioritize reconciliation of 

the Central African people, through an inclusive process that involves men and 

women of all social, economic, political, religious and ethnic backgrounds, 

including, those displaced by the crisis,  

 Calling upon the CAR authorities to urgently implement transparent and 

inclusive measures that allow for stabilization and reconciliation in the CA R, 

including to take concrete steps to restore the effective authority of the State over all 

of the territory of the CAR; to fight impunity by restoring administration of the 

judiciary and the criminal justice system, including the penitentiary system, 

throughout the country; to speed up the reform of the CAR Armed Forces (FACA) 

and internal security forces in order to put in place multi -ethnic, professional, and 

republican security services through appropriate security sector reform processes; to 

carry out the inclusive and effective disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and 

repatriation (DDRR) of armed groups, including children formerly associated with

them; and to establish a functioning public financial management in order to meet 

the expenses related to the functioning of the State, implement early recovery plans, 

and revitalize the economy,  

 Encouraging the CAR authorities, in collaboration with the United Nations 

Multidimensional Integrated Mission in the CAR (MINUSCA) and the European 

Union Training Mission in the CAR (EUTM-RCA), to provide equal opportunities 

for members of armed groups, whether anti-Balaka or ex-Séléka, in the process of 

selecting eligible demobilized members to integrate into the national security and 

defence forces, and to ensure that FACA soldiers of all prefectures enjoy equal 

access to the registration and simplified verification process,  

 Underlining the importance of rebuilding a multi-ethnic, republican and 

professional national army in the CAR, recognizing in this regard the work carried 

out by the EUTM-RCA and welcoming the intention of Member States of the 

Central Africa Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) to contribute to the 

training of the national security and defence forces in support of the CAR 

authorities and in coordination with EUTM,  

 Calling upon the CAR authorities to ensure that perpetrators of violations of 

applicable international law, including those committed against children and 

women, are excluded from the CAR security and armed forces,  

 Welcoming the commitment of the Secretary-General to enforce strictly his 

zero-tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse, expressing grave concern 

over numerous allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse reportedly committed by 

peacekeepers in the CAR, stressing the urgent need for troop- and police-

contributing countries and MINUSCA to promptly investigate those cases in a 

credible and transparent manner and to hold accountable those responsible for such 

criminal offenses or misconduct, and further stressing the need to prevent such 

exploitation and abuse and to improve how these allegations are addressed,  

 Welcoming the Secretary-General’s Report of 29 September 2016 (S/2016/824) 

submitted pursuant to resolution 2301 (2016),  

 Further welcoming also the midterm update and the final report (S/2016/1032) 

of the Panel of Experts on the CAR established pursuant to resolution 2127 (2013), 

expanded by resolution 2134 (2014) and extended pursuant to resolution 2262 

(2016), and taking note of the Panel of Experts’ recommendations,  

 Strongly condemning the ongoing violence and instability in the CAR, and the 

threats of violence, human rights violations and abuses and international 

humanitarian law violations, including against women and children; the attacks 

against United Nations peacekeepers, international forces and humanitarian 

personnel; the continuous cycle of provocations and reprisals by armed groups, both 

inside and outside Bangui and denial of humanitarian access, committed by armed 

elements, which continue to adversely affect the dire humanitarian situation faced 

by the civilian population and to impede humanitarian access to vulnerable 

populations,  

 Stressing the urgent and imperative need to end impunity in the CAR and to 

bring to justice perpetrators of these acts, some of which may amount to crimes 

under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), to which the

CAR is a State party, noting in this regard the opening by the Prosecutor of the 

International Criminal Court on 24 September 2014 of an investigation following 

the request of the national authorities on alleged crimes committed since 2012 and 

welcoming the ongoing cooperation by the CAR authorities in this regard,  

 Stressing the importance of putting in place an effective national judicial 

system, underlining the need to bolster national accountability mechanisms, 

including through further implementation of the 7 August 2014 Memorandum of 

Understanding (MoU) on Urgent Temporary Measures, and the law promulgated in 

June 2015 to establish a national Special Criminal Court to investigate and 

prosecute serious crimes committed in the CAR, and recalling the importance of 

continuous support of the international community to this process pursued by the 

CAR authorities,  

 Emphasizing that those engaging in or providing support for acts that 

undermine the peace, stability or security of the CAR, threaten or impede the 

political stabilization and reconciliation process, target civilians and attack 

peacekeepers may meet criteria for designation under sanctions as stated in this 

resolution,  

 Expressing concern that illicit trafficking, trade, exploitation and smuggling of 

natural resources including gold, diamonds and wildlife has a negative impact in the 

economy and the development of the country, and that it continues to threaten the 

peace and stability of the CAR,  

 Taking note of the Kimberley Process (KP) Administrative Decision on 

Resumption of Exports of Rough Diamonds from the CAR, its annexed Operational 

Framework, and the work of the KP Monitoring Team for CAR and recognizing the 

extraordinary efforts of the CAR Authorities and the KP, to responsibly and 

progressively, through pre-established “compliant zones”, reintegrate the CAR into 

the global diamond trade,  

 Noting with concern the findings of the Panel of Experts’ final report that the 

Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) remains active in the CAR, has established links to 

other armed groups and is generating revenues from the exploitation and trade of 

natural resources, including gold, diamonds and wildlife poaching,  

 Further noting with concern the ongoing transnational criminal activity in the 

region, emphasizing the risk of the situation in the CAR providing a conducive 

environment for further transnational criminal activities, such as those involving 

arms trafficking and the use of mercenaries as well as a potential breeding ground 

for radical networks,  

 Acknowledging in this respect the important contribution the Council -

mandated arms embargo can make to countering the illicit transfer of arms and 

related materiel in the CAR and its region, and in supporting post-conflict 

peacebuilding, DDRR and SSR processes, recalling its resolutions 2117 (2013), 

2127 (2013), 2220 (2015) and 2262 (2016) and expressing grave concern at the 

threat to peace and security in the CAR arising from the illicit transfer, destabilizing 

accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons, and the use of such 

weapons against civilians affected by armed conflict,

and this resolution, including the obligation to implement targeted sanctions against 

individuals and entities designated by the Sanctions Committee established pursuant 

to resolution 2127 (2013) (the Committee),  

 Noting the critical importance of effective implementation of the sanctions 

regime, including the key role that neighbouring States, as well as regional and 

subregional organizations, can play in this regard and encouraging efforts to further 

enhance cooperation and implementation of the sanctions regime in all its aspects,   

 Noting with concern the reports that sanctioned individuals are travelling in 

the region in violation of the travel ban, and underlining that individuals or entities 

who knowingly facilitate the travel of a sanctioned individual in violation of the 

travel ban may be determined by the Committee to have met the designation criteria 

for sanctions,  

 Welcoming efforts by the Chair of the Committee and the President of the 

Security Council to support and strengthen the implementation of the measures
