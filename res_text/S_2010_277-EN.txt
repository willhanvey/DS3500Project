 Sharing the Secretary-General’s assessment of the impact of the earthquake

operations, provide basic services and build State capacity, and acknowledging the 
valuable supporting role MINUSTAH can play in this regard,

Representative of the Secretary-General in the coordination and conduct of all 
activities of United Nations agencies, funds and programmes in Haiti,

 Welcoming the Secretary-General’s report (S/2010/200) of 22 April 2010, and 
its recommendations,  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, as described in 
section 1 of operative paragraph 7 of resolution 1542 (2004),  

 1. Authorizes the deployment of a further 680 police in addition to the 
police strength authorized by resolution 1908 (2010), as a temporary surge capacity 
with clearly defined objectives, and a particular focus on building the capacity of 
the Haitian National Police; 

 2. Decides, therefore, that MINUSTAH will consist of a military component 
of up to 8,940 troops of all ranks and of a police component of up to 4,391 police 
and that it will keep the new levels of troops and police in MINUSTAH under close 
and regular review, including through the electoral period and subsequent 
constitutional transfer of power, and requests the Secretary-General to include in his 
upcoming report to the Council an assessment of the implementation of resolution 
1908 and the present resolution; 

 3. Reiterates that the ownership and primary responsibility for stabilization 
and development lies with the Government and people of Haiti, and recognizes the 
supporting role of MINUSTAH in this regard; 

 4. Recognizes the need for MINUSTAH to assist the Government of Haiti in 
providing adequate protection of the population, with particular attention to the 
needs of internally displaced persons and other vulnerable groups, especially women 
and children, including through additional joint community policing in the camps 
along with strengthened mechanisms to address sexual and gender-based violence; 
and to tackle the risk of a resurgence in gang violence, organized crime and 
trafficking of children;

collaboration with OCHA and the United Nations Country Team in supporting the 
humanitarian and recovery efforts and further encourages all actors to continue to 
engage in joint planning and coordination at the national and local level;

and police components, such as the concept of operations and rules of engagement, 



 S/2010/277
 

3 10-38990 
 

be regularly updated, as appropriate, and be in line with the provisions of all its 
relevant resolutions, and requests the Secretary-General to report on them to the 
Security Council and troop- and police-contributing countries; 

 7. Encourages MINUSTAH to provide logistical support and technical 
expertise, within available means, to assist the Government of Haiti, as requested, to 
continue operations to build the capacity of its rule of law institutions at the national 
and local level, and to speed up the implementation of the government’s 
resettlement strategy for displaced persons, in the knowledge that such measures are 
temporary and will be phased out as Haitian national capacity grows; 

 8. Requests MINUSTAH to continue its support to the Haitian Government 
and to the Provisional Electoral Council, as requested, in the preparation and 
conduct of Haiti’s elections, and to coordinate international electoral assistance to 
Haiti in cooperation with other international stakeholders including the OAS;
