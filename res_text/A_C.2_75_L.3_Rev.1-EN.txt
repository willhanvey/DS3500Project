 Reaffirming World Trade Organization decision WT/MIN(15)/48-WT/L/982 of 

19 December 2015 on the implementation of preferential treatment in favour of 

services and service suppliers of the least developed countries and increasing their 

participation in services trade and decision WT/L/508/Add.1 of 25 July 2012 on 

accession by the least developed countries, encouraging progress on the 

implementation of the World Trade Organization work programme on small 

economies, which supports their efforts towards sustainable development,  as also 

reflected in the outcome document of the third International Conference on Small 

Island Developing States, the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) 

Pathway, 1  and stressing that Aid for Trade and targeted trade-related capacity-

building are essential to integrating developing countries, in particular the least 

developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing 

States, into the international trading system,  

 Recognizing the critical role of women as producers and traders and the need to 

address their specific challenges in order to facilitate their equal and active 

participation in domestic, regional and international trade,  

 Recognizing also that multilateral rules and disciplines are the best guarantee 

against protectionism and are fundamental to the transparency, predictability and 

stability of international trade,  

 Noting the commitments to working to ensure that bilateral, regional and 

plurilateral trade agreements complement the multilateral trading system, recognizing 

that they can play an important role in complementing global liberalization initiatives, 

and in this regard recalling the entry into force of the Agreement Establishing the 

African Continental Free Trade Area, on 30 May 2019, 

 Noting with great concern the threat to human health, safety and well-being 

caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as the severe 

disruption to societies and economies and the devastating impact on lives and  

livelihoods, and that the poorest and most vulnerable are the hardest hit by the 

pandemic, reaffirming the ambition to get back on track to achieve the Sustainable 

Development Goals by designing sustainable and inclusive recovery strategies to 

accelerate progress towards the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda and to help to 

reduce the risk of future shocks, and recognizing that the COVID-19 pandemic requires 

a global response based on unity, solidarity and renewed multilateral cooperation,  

 Deeply concerned that the COVID-19 pandemic, owing to its severe disruptions 

to societies, economies, employment, global trade, supply chains and travel, as well 

as to agricultural, industrial and commercial systems, is having a devastating impact 

on sustainable development and humanitarian needs, including on poverty 

eradication, livelihoods, ending hunger, food security and nutrition, education, 

environmentally sound waste management and access to health care, especially for 

the poor and people in vulnerable situations, in particular in developing countries, 

including countries in special situations and those countries most affected by the 

pandemic and its socioeconomic consequences, and is making the prospect of 

achieving all Sustainable Development Goals more difficult, including eradicating 

poverty in all its forms and dimensions by 2030, ending hunger and achieving food 

security and improved nutrition,  

 Reiterating the pledge that no one will be left behind, reaffirming the 

recognition that the dignity of the human person is fundamental, and the wish to see 

the Goals and targets met for all nations and peoples and for all segments of society, 

and recommitting to endeavour to reach the furthest behind first,

Nations Conference on Trade and Development 2  and the note by the Secretary-

General;3 

 2. Reaffirms that international trade is an engine for inclusive growth and 

poverty eradication and that it contributes to the promotion of sustainable development, 

structural transformation and industrialization, particularly in developing countries;  

 3. Reiterates that States will not be able to achieve the ambitious Goals and 

targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 4 without a revitalized and 

enhanced global partnership and comparably ambitious means of implementation, and 

that a revitalized global partnership will facilitate an intensive global engagement in 

support of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, bringing together Governments, 

civil society, the private sector, the United Nations system and other actors and 

mobilizing all available resources;  

 4. Reaffirms the commitments made through the adoption of the Addis Ababa 

Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development5 

in, inter alia, international trade as an important action area for sustainable 

development; 

 5. Notes with concern that the World Trade Organization is increasingly 

affected by insufficient progress in multilateral trade negotiations and that it is 

imperative for the World Trade Organization to address issues that are at the heart of 

current problems in international trade, and recognizes in this regard the need to 

strengthen the World Trade Organization, with a view to ensuring the continued 

viability and effectiveness of its dispute settlement, negotiating and monitoring 

functions; 

 6. Recommits firmly to promoting a universal, rules-based, open, transparent,

to rectify any trade-distorting measures that are inconsistent with World Trade

commitments and obligations, and also emphasizes that the work of the World Trade 

Organization shall maintain development at its centre, with provisions for special and 

differential treatment remaining integral;  

 8. Also emphasizes that the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the normal 

functioning of open markets, global supply chain connectivity  and the flow of 

essential goods and services, and that these disruptions hinder the fight against 

poverty, hunger and inequality, ultimately undermining efforts to achieve the 2030 

Agenda, reaffirms that emergency measures must be targeted, proportionate,  

transparent and temporary, that they must not create unnecessary barriers to trade or 

disruption to global supply chains, and that they must be consistent with World Trade 

Organization rules, and calls upon Member States to reaffirm the critical importanc e 

of connected global supply chains in ensuring the unimpeded flow of vital medical 

and food supplies and other essential goods and services across borders, by air, by 

land and by sea, and to encourage cooperation to facilitate cross-border travel of 

persons for essential purposes without undermining efforts to prevent the spread of 

the virus, highlights, in this regard, the critical role of digital technologies in
