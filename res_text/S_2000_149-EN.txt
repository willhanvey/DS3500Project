the Settlement Plan and agreements adopted by the parties, to hold a free, fair
and impartial referendum for the self-determination of the people of the Western

an early, durable and agreed resolution of their dispute;

3. Requests the Secretary-General to provide an assessment of the
situation before the end of the present mandate;
