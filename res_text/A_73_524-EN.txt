 Convinced that occupation itself represents a gross and grave violation of human 

rights, 

 Noting with deep regret that 51 years have passed since the onset of the Israeli 

occupation, and stressing the urgent need for efforts to reverse the negative trends on 

the ground and to restore a political horizon for advancing and accelerating 

meaningful negotiations aimed at the achievement of a peace agreement that will 

bring a complete end to the Israeli occupation that began in 1967 and the resolution 

of all core final status issues, without exception, leading to a peaceful, just, lasting 

and comprehensive solution for the question of Palestine,  

 Recognizing that the occupation and ensuing persistent and systematic 

violations of international law by Israel, including international humanitarian and 

human rights law, are considered to be the main sources of other Israeli violations and 

discriminatory policies against the Palestinian civilian population in the Occupied 

Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem,  

 Gravely concerned about the continuing detrimental impact of ongoing 

unlawful Israeli practices and measures in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 

including East Jerusalem, including the excessive use of force by the Israeli 

occupying forces against Palestinian civilians, resulting in the death and injury of 

civilians and the widespread destruction of property and vital infrastructure, including 

during the Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip in July and August 2014, as 

well as ongoing settlement activities and construction of the wall, the internal forced 

displacement of civilians, the imposition of collective punishment measures, 

particularly against the civilian population in the Gaza Strip, where continuing severe 

restrictions on movement amount to a blockade, and the detention and imprisonment 

of thousands of Palestinians, 

 Expressing grave concern about tensions, instability and violence in the 

Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, due to the illegal policies 

and practices of Israel, the occupying Power, including, in particular, provocations 

and incitements regarding the holy places of Jerusalem, including the Haram al Sharif,  

 Gravely concerned about all acts of violence, intimidation and provocation by 

Israeli settlers against Palestinian civilians and properties, including homes, mosques, 

churches and agricultural lands,  

 Gravely concerned also by reports regarding serious human rights violations 

and grave breaches of international humanitarian law, 10 

 Recalling the report of the independent commission of inquiry established 

pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution S-21/1,11 and stressing the imperative 

of ensuring accountability for all violations of international humanitarian law and 

international human rights law in order to end impunity, ensure justice, deter further 

violations, protect civilians and promote peace,  

 Having considered the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli 

Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of 

the Occupied Territories12 and the relevant reports of the Secretary-General,13

 Recalling the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government

agreements between the Palestinian and Israeli sides, 

 Stressing the urgency of bringing a complete end to the Israeli occupation that 

began in 1967, and thus an end to the violation of the human rights of the Palestinian

 3. Deplores those policies and practices of Israel that violate the human rights 

of the Palestinian people and other Arabs of the occupied territories, as reflected in 

the report of the Special Committee covering the reporting period; 12 

 4. Expresses grave concern about the critical situation in the Occupied 

Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, particularly in the Gaza Strip, as a 

result of unlawful Israeli practices and measures, and especially condemns and calls 

for the immediate cessation of all illegal Israeli settlement activities and the 

construction of the wall, the lifting of the blockade of the Gaza Strip, as well as a 

complete cessation of the excessive and indiscriminate use of force and military 

operations against the civilian population, settler violence, the destruction and 

confiscation of properties, including home demolitions as a measure of reprisal, the 

forced displacement of civilians, all measures of collective punishment, and the 

detention and imprisonment of thousands of civilians;  

 5. Requests the Special Committee, pending complete termination of the 

Israeli occupation, to continue to investigate Israeli policies and practices in the 

Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories 

occupied by Israel since 1967, especially Israeli violations of the Geneva Convention 

relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, 1 and 

to consult, as appropriate, with the International Committee of the Red Cross, 

according to its regulations, in order to ensure that the welfare and human rights of 

the peoples of the occupied territories, including prisoners and detainees, are 

safeguarded, and to report to the Secretary-General as soon as possible and whenever 

the need arises thereafter;

 Recalling further the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government 

Arrangements of 13 September 19939 and the subsequent implementation agreements 

between the Palestinian and Israeli sides,  

 Recalling the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State solution to the Israeli-

Palestinian conflict, 10  and emphasizing specifically its call for a freeze on all 

settlement activity, including so-called natural growth, and the dismantlement of all 

settlement outposts erected since March 2001, and the need for Israel to uphold its 

obligations and commitments in this regard,  

 Recalling also its resolution 67/19 of 29 November 2012, 

 Noting the accession by Palestine to several human rights treaties and the core 

humanitarian law conventions, as well as other international treaties,  

 Aware that Israeli settlement activities involve, inter alia, the transfer of 

nationals of the occupying Power into the occupied territories, the confiscation of 

land, the forced transfer of Palestinian civilians, including Bedouin families, the 

exploitation of natural resources, the fragmentation of territory and other actions 

against the Palestinian civilian population and the civilian population in the occupied 

Syrian Golan that are contrary to international law,  

 Bearing in mind the extremely detrimental impact of Israeli settlement policies, 

decisions and activities on the ongoing regional and international efforts to resume 

and advance the peace process, on the prospects for the achievement of peace in the 

Middle East in accordance with the two-State solution of Israel and Palestine, living 

side by side in peace and security within recognized borders, on the basis of the 

pre-1967 borders, and on the viability and credibility of that solution,  

 Expressing grave concern about the continuation by Israel, the occupying 

Power, of settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 

Jerusalem, and condemning those activities as violations of international 

humanitarian law, relevant United Nations resolutions, the agreements reached 

between the parties and obligations under the Quartet road map and as actions in 

defiance of the calls by the international community to cease all settlement activities,  

 Deploring in particular Israel’s construction and expansion of settlements in 

and around occupied East Jerusalem, including its so-called E-1 plan that aims to 

connect its illegal settlements around and further isolate occupied East Jerusalem, the 

continuing demolition of Palestinian homes and eviction of Palestinian families from 

the city, the revocation of Palestinian residency rights in the city, and ongoing 

settlement activities in the Jordan Valley, all of which further fragment and undermine 

the contiguity of the Occupied Palestinian Territory,  

 Deploring the plans to demolish the Palestinian village of Khan al-Ahmar, in 

contravention of international law, which would have serious consequences with 

regard to the displacement of its residents, severely threaten the viability of the two -

State solution and undermine the prospect of peace, given the area’s sensitive location 

and importance for preserving the contiguity of the Palestinian territory, and 

demanding the cessation of such plans,  

 Taking note of the Quartet report of 1 July 2016, 11  and stressing its 

recommendations, as well as its recent statements, including of 30 September 2015, 

23 October 2015, 12 February 2016 and 23 September 2016, in which the Quartet 

members concluded that, inter alia, the continuing policy of settlement construction

and expansion, designation of land for exclusive Israeli use and denial of Palestinian 

development, including the recent high rate of demolitions, are steadily eroding the 

two-State solution, 

 Deploring the continuing unlawful construction by Israel of the wall inside the 

Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and 

expressing its concern, in particular, about the route of the wall in departure from the 

Armistice Line of 1949 and in such a way as to include the great majority of the Israeli 

settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and 

which is causing humanitarian hardship and a serious decline of socioeconomic 

conditions for the Palestinian people, is fragmenting the territorial contiguity of the 

Territory and undermining its viability, and could prejudge future negotiations and 

make the two-State solution physically impossible to implement,  

 Condemning acts of violence and terror against civilians on both sides, and 

recalling the need to end all acts of violence, including acts of terror, provocation, 

incitement and destruction, 

 Condemning also all acts of violence, destruction, harassment, provocation and 

incitement by Israeli settlers in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 

Jerusalem, against Palestinian civilians, including children, and their properties, 

including historic and religious sites, and agricultural lands, as well as acts of terror 

by several extremist Israeli settlers, and calling for accountability for the illegal 

actions perpetrated in this regard,  

 Taking note of the relevant reports of the Secretary-General, including pursuant 

to Security Council resolution 2334 (2016),12  

 Noting the special meeting of the Security Council convened on 26 September 

2008, as well as the meeting of the Council of 18 February 2011,  

 1. Reaffirms that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 

including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan are illegal and an obstacle 

to peace and economic and social development;  

 2. Calls upon Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the Geneva 

Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 

1949,1 to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and to the 

occupied Syrian Golan and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the Convention, 

in particular article 49, and to comply with all of its obligations under international 

law and cease immediately all actions causing the alteration of the character, status 

and demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 

Jerusalem, and of the occupied Syrian Golan;  

 3. Reiterates its demand for the immediate and complete cessation of all 

Israeli settlement activities in all of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 

Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan, and calls in this regard for the full 

implementation of all the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, including, inter 

alia, resolutions 446 (1979), 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979, 465 (1980), 476 (1980),

amounting to a blockade on the Gaza Strip, and in this regard to fully implement the 

Agreement on Movement and Access and the Agreed Principles for the Rafah 

Crossing, both of 15 November 2005, in order to allow for the sustained and regular

Organization commitments and the Quartet principles;

  Draft resolution V  

  The occupied Syrian Golan 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Having considered the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli 

Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of 

the Occupied Territories,1  

 Deeply concerned that the Syrian Golan, occupied since 1967, has been under 

continued Israeli military occupation,  

 Recalling Security Council resolution 497 (1981) of 17 December 1981,  

 Recalling also its previous relevant resolutions, the most recent of which was 

resolution 72/88 of 7 December 2017, 

 Having considered the report of the Secretary-General submitted in pursuance 

of resolution 72/88,2  

 Recalling its previous relevant resolutions in which, inter alia, it called upon 

Israel to put an end to its occupation of the Arab territories,  

 Reaffirming once more the illegality of the decision of 14 December 1981 taken 

by Israel to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian 

Golan, which has resulted in the effective annexation of that territory,  

 Reaffirming that the acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible under 

international law, including the Charter of the United Nations,  

 Reaffirming also the applicability of the Geneva Convention relative to the 

Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, 3 to the occupied 

Syrian Golan, 

 Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 237 (1967) of 14 June 1967,

on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 

338 (1973) of 22 October 1973 aimed at the realization of a just, comprehensive and 

lasting peace, and expressing grave concern about the stalling of the peace process on 

all tracks, 

 1. Calls upon Israel, the occupying Power, to comply with the relevant 

resolutions on the occupied Syrian Golan, in particular Security Council resolution 

497 (1981), in which the Council, inter alia, decided that the Israeli decision to impose 

its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan was null and 

void and without international legal effect and demanded that Israel, the occupying 

Power, rescind forthwith its decision;  

 2. Also calls upon Israel to desist from changing the physical character, 

demographic composition, institutional structure and legal status of the occupied 

Syrian Golan and in particular to desist from the establishment of settlements;  

 3. Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions 

taken or to be taken by Israel, the occupying Power, that purport to alter the character 

and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void, constitute a flagrant
