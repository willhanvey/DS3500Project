indiscriminate killing and deliberate targeting of civilians as such, in violation of 

international humanitarian law, and acts of violence that may foment sectarian 

tensions,  

 Noting with concern the culture of impunity for serious violations of 

international humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human rights law 

committed during the present conflict, which has provided a fertile ground for 

further violations and abuses,  

 Recalling that, amid expressions of popular discontent over restrictions on the 

enjoyment of civil, political, economic and social rights, civilian protests erupted in 

Dar’a in March 2011, and noting that the excessive and violent oppression of 

civilian protests by the Syrian authorities, which later escalated to the direct shelling 

of civilian population areas, fuelled the escalation of armed violence and extremist 

groups,  

 Expressing outrage at the continuing escalation of violence in the Syrian Arab 

Republic, which has caused more than 191,000 fatalities,16 and in particular at the 

continued widespread and systematic gross violations, as well as abuses, of human 

rights and violations of international humanitarian law, including those involving 

the continued use of heavy weapons and aerial bombardments, such as the 

indiscriminate use of ballistic missiles, cluster munitions, barrel and vacuum bombs, 

chlorine gas, and starvation of civilians as a method of combat by the Syrian 

authorities against the Syrian population,  

 Expressing grave concern at the disproportionate use of force by the Syrian 

authorities against civilians, which has caused immense human suffering and 

fomented the spread of extremism and extremist groups and which demonstrates the 

failure of the Syrian authorities to protect the Syrian population and to implement 

the relevant resolutions and decisions of United Nations bodies,

countries, notably in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, Egypt and Libya,
