 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions and statements by its President on the 
situation in Liberia and West Africa, 

 Welcoming the sustained progress made by the Government of Liberia since 
January 2006, in rebuilding Liberia for the benefit of all Liberians, with the support 
of the international community, 

 Stressing that Liberia’s progress in the timber sector must continue with the 
effective implementation and enforcement of the National Forestry Reform Law 
signed into law on 5 October 2006, and other new legislation related to revenue 
transparency (the Liberia Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative Act) and 
resolution of land and tenure rights (Community Rights Law with respect to Forest 
Lands and Lands Commission Act), 

 Encouraging the Government of Liberia to reaffirm its commitment and 
redouble its efforts to ensure the effective implementation of the Kimberley Process 
Certification Scheme in Liberia and to take all possible measures to prevent rough 
diamond smuggling, 

 Encouraging the Government of Liberia to improve its control over the gold 
sector and adopt the necessary legislation in this regard, and focus its efforts on 
establishing effective governance of the gold production sector, 

 Stressing the continuing importance of the United Nations Mission in Liberia 
(UNMIL) in improving security throughout Liberia and helping the Government 
establish its authority throughout the country, particularly in the diamond, gold, 
timber, and other natural resources-producing regions, and border areas, 

 Taking note of the report of the United Nations Panel of Experts on Liberia 
(S/2011/757) 757, 

 Underlining its determination to support the Government of Liberia in its 
efforts to meet the conditions of resolution 1521 (2003), welcoming the engagement 
of the Peacebuilding Commission, and encouraging all stakeholders, including 
donors, to support the Government of Liberia in its efforts,  

 Acknowledging the implementation of the guidelines of the Department of 
Peacekeeping Operations on cooperation and information sharing between the 



S/2011/769  
 

11-63823 2

Committees’ expert panels, 

 Commending the people of Liberia on the completion of their presidential 
election of 8 November, which was free, fair and transparent, and further 
commending the National Elections Commission’s successful organization of the 
electoral process, in accordance with Liberian law, 

 Expressing concern about the violent events of 7 November 2011 and welcoming 
the Government of Liberia’s establishment of a Special Independent Commission of 
Inquiry to investigate the events and determine the facts and circumstances through 
independent and impartial proceedings that meet international standards, in order to 
hold accountable those responsible, 

 Calling on all Liberian leaders to promote meaningful reconciliation and 
inclusive dialogue to consolidate peace and advance Liberia’s democratic 
development, 

 Determining that, despite significant progress, the situation in Liberia 
continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security in the region,
