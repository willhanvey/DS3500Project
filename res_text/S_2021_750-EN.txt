  France: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling all its previous resolutions, statements of its President and press 

statements on the situation in Mali,  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, unity and territorial 

integrity of Mali, emphasizing that the Malian authorities have primary responsibility 

for the provision of stability and security throughout the territory of Mali, and 

underscoring the importance of achieving national ownership of peace- and security-

related initiatives, 

 Recalling the provisions of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali 

(“the Agreement”) calling upon the Security Council to give its full support to the 

Agreement, to closely monitor its implementation and, if necessary, to take measures 

against anyone hindering the implementation of the commitments contained therein 

or the realization of its objectives,  

 Reiterating that the United Nations, the African Union, the Economic 

Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and other international partners 

remain firmly committed to the implementation of the Agreement as a means to 

achieve long-term peace and stability in Mali, welcoming the updated Feuille de route 

on the implementation of the Agreement and the efforts by the Comité de suivi de 

l’Accord (CSA) to enhance its role in support of this implementation , but expressing 

a significant impatience with parties over the persistent delays in the implementation 

of the Agreement, which contribute to a political and security vacuum jeopardizing 

the stability and development of Mali, stressing the need for increased ownership and 

prioritization in the implementation of the Agreement, and further stressing the 

importance of the full, equal and meaningful participation of women in all the 

mechanisms established by the Agreement to support and monitor its implementation, 

 Expressing grave concern about the continued deterioration of the political 

situation in Mali, in particular following the mutiny of 18 August 2020 and the 

violation of the Transition Charter of 24 May 2021, both of which the Security 

Council condemned, recalling the establishment of the transitional arrangements in 

Mali, including a Transition Charter, a Transition Action Plan, and an election 

calendar unveiled on 15 April 2021, calling on all Malian stakeholders to facilitate 

the full realization of the Political Transition and the handover of power to elected 

civilian authorities, urging the Malian authorities to implement these arrangements 

within the established 18-month timeline, including the organization of the 

presidential election on 27 February 2022 as per the electoral calendar, reiterating 

decisions that the Head of the Transition, the Vice-president and the Prime minister 



S/2021/750 
 

 

21-12012 2/3 

 

of the Transition should not under any circumstances be candidates for the 

forthcoming presidential election, and welcoming the mediation by ECOWAS and the 

role of the Monitoring Mechanism it has announced,  

 Expressing great concern at the violent and unilateral actions taken by non-State 

actors in Mali hampering the return of State authority and basic social services,  

 Strongly condemning the activities in Mali and the Sahel region of ISIL (Da’esh) 

and Al-Qaida-linked terrorist organizations such as Islamic State in West Africa 

Province (ISWAP), IS in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), and Jama'at Nasr al -Islam wal 

Muslimin (JNIM), 

 Strongly condemning all abuses and violations of human rights and violations 

of international humanitarian law in Mali, including those involving sexual violence 

in conflict and the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict, calling upon all 

parties to bring an end to such violations and abuses and to comply with their 

obligations under applicable international law,  

 Stressing that the measures imposed by this resolution are not intended to have 

adverse humanitarian consequences for the civilian population of Mali, 

 Recalling the need for Member States to ensure that all measures taken by them 

to implement this resolution comply with their obligations under international law, 

including international humanitarian law, international human rights law and 

international refugee law, as applicable,  

 Recalling the provisions of resolution 2584 (2021) urging the Malian parties to 

take immediate and concrete action, in a spirit of genuine cooperation, to  fulfil the 

priority measures listed in its paragraph 4 before the end of MINUSMA’s current 

mandate, encouraging the Panel of Experts established pursuant to resolution 2374 

(2017) (“the Panel of Experts”) to identify parties responsible for potential lack of 

implementation of these priority measures through its regular reporting and interim 

updates, and expressing its intent, should these priority measures not be implemented 

by the end of MINUSMA’s current mandate, to respond with measures pursuant to 

resolution 2374 (2017) on individuals and entities who are thus obstructing or 

threatening the implementation of the Agreement,  

 Stressing that all parties to the Agreement share the primary responsibility to 

make steadfast progress in its implementation,  

 Taking note of the decisions of the Security Council Committee established 

pursuant to resolution 2374 (2017) concerning Mali (“the Committee”) of 

20 December 2018 and 10 July 2019 that several individuals be placed on the list of 

individuals and entities subject to measures pursuant to resolution 2374 (2017) (“the 

2374 Sanctions List”) and further taking note of the intention of the Committee to 

consider the removal of these individuals from the 2374 Sanctions List if the priority 

measures listed in paragraph 4 of resolution 2584 (2021) are fully implemented and 

the individuals designated cease all illicit activities, including those listed in the 

statement of case, while stressing that the Security Council has not yet seen sufficient 

progress to merit such consideration,  

 Reiterating its call for all States, particularly Mali and those in the region, to 

actively implement the measures contained in this resolution,  

 Reiterating that individuals or entities placed on the 2374 Sanctions List shall 

not benefit from any financial, operational or logistical support from United Nations 

entities deployed in Mali, until their removal from the 2374 Sanctions List and 

without prejudice to the exemptions set by paragraphs 2, 5, 6 and 7 of resolution 2374 

(2017), and welcoming the measures already taken by United Nations entities
