 Remaining however deeply concerned over the lack of progress on the ground 

in some situations of concern, where parties to conflict continue to violate wi th 

impunity the relevant provisions of applicable international law relating to the rights 

and protection of children in armed conflict,  

 Underlining in this regard the importance of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda 

for Sustainable Development, and recognizing that a strong focus is needed on combating 

poverty, deprivation and inequality to prevent and protect children from all violations and 

abuses in particular in the context of armed conflict and to promote the resilience of 

children, their families and their communities, and the importance of promoting education 

for all and peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development,  

 Reaffirming the right to education and its fundamental contribution to the 

achievement of peace and security and further recognizing that investment in 

universal, and inclusive education and training is an important investment that States 

can make to ensure the immediate and long-term development of children, and 

reiterating that access to inclusive, equitable and quality formal and non-formal 

education are important factors that enable children and youth to acquire the relevant 

skills and to build their capacities, 

 Expressing concerns that children account for many of those adversely affected 

by armed conflict, including as refugees and internally displaced persons, and that the 

disruption of access to education and future economic opportunities has a dramatic 

impact on durable peace and reconciliation,  

 Expressing grave concern about the significant increase of attacks against 

schools and education facilities in recent years and the alarming number of children 

denied their right to education, as well as about attacks on schools and their 

infrastructure, rising instances of abduction of children, and the targeting of schools 

for the purposes of abductions, as reported by the United Nations, the severity and 

frequency of threats of attacks and attacks against schools and civilians connected to 

schools, including children and teachers, the use of schools for military purposes, as 

well as the immediate negative impact of attacks on the safety of students and their 

ability to enjoy their right to education, with long-term negative consequences for 

them as individuals, their families and their communities,  

 Acknowledging the disproportionate negative impact of the COVID-19 

pandemic, notably the socio-economic impact, and the adverse effects on children in 

armed conflict and children formerly associated with armed groups and armed forces 

who are undergoing reintegration assistance and noting the heightened risk for 

children in armed conflict, of not resuming their education following school closures, 

particularly girls, making them more vulnerable to child labor, child recruitment as 

well as forced marriage, 

 Expressing deep concerns that girls and women may be the intended victims of 

attacks targeting their access to and continuation of education, and expressing concern 

about the specific consequences of such attacks including but not limited to incidents 

of rape and other forms of sexual violence including sexual slavery, threats of attacks, 

at school and on the way to and from school, abductions, forced marriage, human 

trafficking, and any resulting stigma and grave consequences on their health, all of 

which may further impede the continuation of their education,  

 Expressing deep concern that many children in armed conflict, in particular 

girls, lack access to education owing to attacks and threats of attacks against schools, 

damaged or destroyed school buildings, mines and explosive remnants of war, 

insecurity, the prevalence of violence, including sexual and gender-based violence 

against children, in and around schools and loss or lack of civil documentation,  



 
S/2021/893 

 

3/7 21-15745 

 

 Stressing that all parties to armed conflict must comply strictly with the 

obligations applicable to them under international law for the protection of children 

in armed conflict, including those contained in the Geneva Conventions of 

12th August 1949 and the Additional Protocols of 1977 as well as in the Convention 

on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocol on the involvement of Children 

in armed conflict, welcoming the steps taken by a number of Member States to make 

commitments to protect children affected by armed conflict, including the ratification 

of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 

involvement of children in armed conflict,  

 Taking note of ongoing international and regional initiatives on Children and 

Armed Conflict, including the international conference held in Paris in 2007 on 

protecting children from unlawful recruitment or use by armed forces or armed groups 

and the follow-up conference held in Paris in 2017, and the commitments during the 

conferences, the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and the 

commemoration of the International Day to Protect Education from attacks,  

 Taking note of efforts aimed at facilitating the continuation of education in 

armed conflict, including the efforts of Member States that have endorsed the Safe

demands that all relevant parties immediately put an end to such practices and take 

special measures to protect children;  

 2. Strongly condemns the continued attacks as well as threats of attacks that 

are in contravention of international humanitarian law against schools and c ivilians

strengthen coherence between political, security, human rights, development and rule of 

law activities, which remain the primary responsibility of Member States;  

 6. Condemns the military use of schools in contravention of international law, 

and recognizes that use by armed forces and armed groups may render schools 

legitimate targets of attack, thus endangering children’s and teachers’ safety as well

schools and educational facilities in accordance with international humanitarian law;

recurrence of these acts; and urges Member States to ensure that such violations are 

investigated and those responsible duly prosecuted;  

 9. Encourages Member States affected by armed conflict to take immediate 

measures to rehabilitate, repair, or replace schools that have been subject to attack

protecting and supporting teachers, who play an important role in this regard, and 

calls for the continued support of relevant United Nations entities, as well as 

international and regional bodies, in assisting Member States, upon request;  

 10. Calls upon Member States to protect schools as spaces free from all forms 

of violence, noting that girls may be the intended victims of attack on their education,

sexual violence, and urges Member States to take steps to address girls’ equal 

enjoyment of their right to education;  

 11. Calls upon member states to halt and prevent recruitment and 

re-recruitment of children contrary to the obligations of parties to conflict, through,
