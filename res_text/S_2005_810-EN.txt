(S/PRST/2005/46),

Reaffirming its commitment to respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity
and political independence of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as all
States in the region, and its support for the process of the Global and All-Inclusive
Agreement on the Transition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, signed in
Pretoria on 17 December 2002, and underlining the importance of elections as the
foundation for the longer-term restoration of peace and stability, national
reconciliation and establishment of the rule of law in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo,

Reiterating its serious concern regarding the continuation of hostilities by
militias and foreign armed groups in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, and at the threat they pose to civilians and to the holding of elections in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to stability in the region,

Deploring the violations of human rights and international humanitarian law
committed by these groups and militias and stressing the urgent need for those
responsible for these crimes to be brought to justice,

Welcoming the robust action taken by the United Nations Organization Mission
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) against these groups and
militias, and commending the dedication of the personnel of MONUC, who are
operating in particularly hazardous conditions,

Calling upon all armed groups in the Great Lakes Region of Africa, such as
the Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda (FDLR), the Palipehutu —
Forces nationales de libération (FNL), the Lord’s Resistance Army, to act without
delay to lay down their arms, enter demobilization programmes and support efforts
to consolidate peace under way in the region,

Having noted the decision, taken on 16 September 2005 by the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, acting within the framework



2

S/2005/810

of the Tripartite Plus Joint Commission, to retain the deadline of 30 September 2005
for the voluntary disarmament of the FDLR, on the understanding that sanctions
would be imposed should they fail to respect this deadline,

Taking note of the letter dated 21 October 2005 from the ministers representing
Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Uganda on the
Tripartite Plus Joint Commission addressed to the President of the Council,

Calling upon the States of the region to deepen their cooperation with a view
to putting an end to the activities of illegal armed groups, and underlining that any
recourse to the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity of a State is
contrary to the Charter of the United Nations,

Urging in this regard participants in the International Conference on Peace,
Security, Democracy and Development in the Great Lakes Region of Africa to
convene the second summit as soon as possible,

Aware that the link between the illegal exploitation of natural resources, the

the factors fuelling and exacerbating conflicts in the Great Lakes Region of Africa,
and especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,

Paying tribute to the donor community for the assistance it is providing to the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and encouraging it to maintain that assistance,
