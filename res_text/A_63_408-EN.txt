overcoming the problems of smallness, isolation and lack of resources;

meet its obligations to the United Nations with respect to Tokelau and abide by the 
freely expressed wishes of the people of Tokelau with regard to their future status;

 Aware of the importance both to the Territories and to the Special Committee 
of the participation of elected and appointed representatives of the Territories in the 
work of the Special Committee, 

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories 
should continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 
referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 
important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people, 

 Convinced also that any negotiations to determine the status of a Territory 
must take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of that

concern at the procedure followed by some administering Powers, contrary to the 
wishes of the Territories themselves, of amending or enacting legislation for 
application to the Territories, either through Orders in Council, in order to apply to 
the Territories the international treaty obligations of the administering Power, or 
through the unilateral application of laws and regulations,

consultation with the administering Powers, 

 Mindful also that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its 
understanding of the political status of the peoples of the Territories and to fulfil its

and to receive information from other appropriate sources, including the 
representatives of the Territories, concerning the wishes and aspirations of the 
peoples of the Territories, 



 A/63/408

bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at 
assisting the peoples of the Territories in gaining a better understanding of the 
options of self-determination, 

 Mindful, in this connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the 
Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 
representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 
the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate, and that the regional nature of the 
seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial 
element in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political 
status of the Territories, 

 Mindful also that the 2008 Pacific regional seminar was held in Bandung, 
Indonesia, from 14 to 16 May,

Territories by the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations 
system, in particular the United Nations Development Programme, the Economic 
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and the Economic and Social 
Commission for Asia and the Pacific, as well as regional institutions such as the 
Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean Community, the Organization of 
Eastern Caribbean States, the Pacific Islands Forum and the agencies of the Council 
of Regional Organizations in the Pacific,

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,5 reviews the status of the self-
determination process, including in small island Territories under examination by
