  A global call for concrete action for the total elimination of racism, 

racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and the 

comprehensive implementation of and follow-up to the Durban

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling all its previous resolutions on the comprehensive follow-up to the 

World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related 

Intolerance and the effective implementation of the Durban Declaration and 

Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference,1 and in this regard 

underlining the imperative need for their full and effective implementation,  

 Stressing that the outcome of the World Conference against Racism, Racial 

Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance has the same status as the 

outcomes of all the major United Nations conferences, summits and special sessions 

in the human rights and social fields, and that the Durban Declaration and 

Programme of Action remains the only instructive outcome of the World 

Conference, which prescribes comprehensive measures for combating all the 

scourges of racism and adequate remedies for victims,  

 Recalling the three Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial 

Discrimination previously declared by the General Assembly, and regretting that the 

Programmes of Action for those Decades were not fully implemented and that their 

objectives are yet to be attained,

 Reiterating that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights 

and have the potential to contribute constructively to the development and wel l-being 

of their societies, and that any doctrine of racial superiority is scientifically false, 

morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and must be rejected, together 

with theories that attempt to determine the existence of separate human races, 

 Underlining the intensity, magnitude and organized nature of slavery and the 

slave trade, including the transatlantic slave trade, and the associated historical 

injustices, as well as the untold suffering caused by colonialism and apartheid, and 

that Africans and people of African descent, Asians and people of Asian descent and 

indigenous peoples continue to be victims of the cascading effects of those legacies,  

 Emphasizing that, despite efforts in this regard, millions of human beings 

continue to be victims of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 

intolerance, including their contemporary manifestations, some of which take violent 

forms, 

 Welcoming the efforts made by civil society in support of the follow-up 

mechanisms in the implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of 

Action,

27 March 2002, with the mandate to follow up on the implementation of the 

provisions of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and to make 

appropriate recommendations thereon, and in this regard underlining the cardinal 

role played and still to be played by those independent eminent exper ts in 

mobilizing global political will for concrete action for the total elimination of all the 

scourges of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,  

 Underlining the primacy of the political will, international cooperation and 

adequate funding at the national, regional and international levels needed to address 

all forms and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 

related intolerance for the successful implementation of the Durban Declaration and 

Programme of Action, 

 Recalling its resolution 2142 (XXI) of 26 October 1966, by which the General 

Assembly proclaimed 21 March as the International Day for the Elimination of 

Racial Discrimination, 

 Recalling also its resolution 62/122 of 17 December 2007, in which it 

designated 25 March as an annual International Day of Remembrance of the Victims 

of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade,  

 Looking forward to the commemoration of the fifteenth anniversary of the 

adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action,

discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and all their abhorrent and 

contemporary forms and manifestations is a matter of priority for the international 

community, 

 Underlining, in the above context, the imperative need to end posturing about 

racism, and calling upon all States to resolutely end impunity for acts of racism,

and racial discrimination; 

 2. Calls upon States that have not done so to consider acceding to the

Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in 2001;

regard, areas such as xenophobia, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism and incitement to

substantive gaps;
