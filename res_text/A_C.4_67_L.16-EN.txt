Additional Protocol I2 to the four Geneva Conventions,3  

 Recalling the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International 
Court of Justice on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory,4 and recalling also General Assembly resolutions 
ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004 and ES-10/17 of 15 December 2006,  

 Noting that the International Court of Justice concluded that “the Israeli 
settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have 
been established in breach of international law”,5  

 Taking note of the recent report of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights 
Council on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 
1967,6 

 Recalling the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government 
Arrangements of 13 September 19937 and the subsequent implementation 
agreements between the Palestinian and Israeli sides,  

 Recalling also the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State solution to the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict,8 and emphasizing specifically its call for a freeze on all 
settlement activity, including so-called natural growth, and the dismantlement of all 
settlement outposts erected since March 2001, and the need for Israel to uphold its 
obligations and commitments in this regard,  

 Aware that Israeli settlement activities involve, inter alia, the transfer of 
nationals of the occupying Power into the occupied territories, the confiscation of 
land, the displacement of Palestinian families, the exploitation of natural resources 
and other actions against the Palestinian civilian population and the civilian 
population in the occupied Syrian Golan that are contrary to international law,  

 Bearing in mind the extremely detrimental impact of Israeli settlement 
policies, decisions and activities on the efforts to resume and advance the peace 
process, on the credibility of the peace process and on the prospects for the 
achievement of peace in the Middle East in accordance with the two-State solution 
of Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security within recognized 
borders, on the basis of the pre-1967 borders,

Power, of settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 
Jerusalem, in violation of international humanitarian law, relevant United Nations 
resolutions, the agreements reached between the parties and obligations under the

Quartet road map, and in defiance of the calls by the international community to 
cease all settlement activities,  

 Expressing grave concern in particular about Israel’s construction and 
expansion of settlements in and around occupied East Jerusalem, including its 
so-called E-1 plan that aims to connect its illegal settlements around and further 
isolate occupied East Jerusalem, the continuing demolition of Palestinian homes and 
eviction of Palestinian families from the city, the revocation of Palestinian residency 
rights in the city, and ongoing settlement activities in the Jordan Valley,  

 Expressing grave concern about the continuing unlawful construction by Israel 
of the wall inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East 
Jerusalem, and expressing its concern in particular about the route of the wall in 
departure from the Armistice Line of 1949, which is causing humanitarian hardship 
and a serious decline of socioeconomic conditions for the Palestinian people, is 
fragmenting the territorial contiguity of the Territory and undermining its viability, 
and could prejudge future negotiations and make the two-State solution physically 
impossible to implement,  

 Deeply concerned that the wall’s route has been traced in such a way as to 
include the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem,  

 Deploring settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan and any activities involving the 
confiscation of land, the disruption of the livelihood of protected persons and the 
de facto annexation of land,  

 Recalling the need to end all acts of violence, including acts of terror, 
provocation, incitement and destruction,  

 Gravely concerned about the rising incidents of violence, destruction, 
harassment, provocation and incitement by illegal armed Israeli settlers in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, against Palestinian 
civilians, including children, and their properties, including historic and religious 
sites, and agricultural lands,  

 Taking note of the relevant reports of the Secretary-General,9  

 Taking note also of the special meeting of the Security Council convened on 
26 September 2008, as well as of the meeting of the Council of 18 February 2011,  

 1. Reaffirms that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan are illegal and 
an obstacle to peace and economic and social development;  

 2. Calls upon Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the Geneva 
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of  
12 August 1949,1 to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
and to the occupied Syrian Golan and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the 
Convention, in particular article 49, and to comply with all of its obligations under 
international law and cease immediately all actions causing the alteration of the

character, status and demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem, and of the occupied Syrian Golan;  

 3. Reiterates its demand for the immediate and complete cessation of all 
Israeli settlement activities in all of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan, and calls, in this regard, for the 
full implementation of all the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, 
including, inter alia, resolutions 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979, 452 (1979) of  
20 July 1979, 465 (1980) of 1 March 1980, 476 (1980) of 30 June 1980 and 1515 
(2003) of 19 November 2003;  

 4. Demands that Israel, the occupying Power, comply with its legal 
obligations, as mentioned in the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the 
International Court of Justice;4  

 5. Reiterates its call for the prevention of all acts of violence, destruction, 
harassment and provocation by Israeli settlers, especially against Palestinian 
civilians and their properties, including historic and religious sites, and agricultural 
lands, and stresses the need for the implementation of Security Council resolution 
904 (1994), in which the Council called upon Israel, the occupying Power, to 
continue to take and implement measures, including confiscation of arms, aimed at 
preventing illegal acts of violence by Israeli settlers, and called for measures to be 
taken to guarantee the safety and protection of the Palestinian civilians in the 
occupied territory;  

 6. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its 
sixty-eighth session on the implementation of the present resolution.
