  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland:  

  draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling the arms embargo on Libya which was imposed, modified and 

reaffirmed by resolutions 1970 (2011), 1973 (2011), 2009 (2011), 2040 (2012), 2095 

(2013), 2144 (2014), 2174 (2014), 2213 (2015), 2214 (2015), and 2278 (2016),  

 Recalling resolution 2259 (2015) which welcomed the signing of the 

17 December 2015 Libyan Political Agreement of Skhirat, Morocco and endorsed 

the Rome Communiqué of 13 December 2015 to support the Government of 

National Accord (“GNA”) as the sole legitimate government of Libya, that should  

be based in Tripoli, reiterating its support for the full implementation of the Libyan 

Political Agreement, and further expressing its determination in this regard to 

support the GNA, 

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, 

territorial integrity and national unity of Libya,  

 Reiterating its grave concern at the growing threat of terrorist groups in Libya 

proclaiming allegiance to Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) (also known as 

Da’esh), the growing trend of groups associating themselves with it, as well as the 

continued presence of other Al-Qaida-linked terrorist groups and individuals 

operating there, and recalling, in this regard, the obligations under resolution 2253 

(2015), 

 Recalling its resolution 2178 (2014), in particular paragraph 5 of that 

resolution, and expressing concern that the flow of foreign terrorist fighters to Libya 

can increase the intensity, duration and complexity of the conflict and pose a serious 

threat to their States of origin, transit, and travel, 

 Expressing deep concern at the threat posed by unsecured arms and 

ammunition in Libya and their proliferation, which undermines stability in Libya 

and the region, including through their transfer to armed groups in violation of the 

arms embargo, and underlining the importance of coordinated international support 

to Libya and the region to address these issues,  

 Expressing concern that the situation in Libya is exacerbated by the smuggling 

of illegal arms and related materiel in violation of the arms embargo, underlining its 

concern at the allegations of violations of the arms embargo by sea, land, or air, and 

expressing further concern that such arms and related materiel are being used by 

terrorist groups operating in Libya, including by ISIL,  



S/2016/531 
 

 

16-09888 2/4 

 

 Welcoming the Vienna Communiqué of 16 May 2016 which recognizes the 

necessity of enhanced coordination efforts between the legitimate Libyan military 

and security forces, urges them to work quickly to implement a unified command in 

accordance with the Libyan Political Agreement to coordinate in the fight against 

Da’esh and UN-designated terrorist groups in Libyan territory, and underlines that 

the GNA has voiced its intention to submit appropriate arms embargo exemption 

requests to the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1970 (2011) (“the 

Committee”) to procure necessary lethal arms and materiel to counter 

UN-designated terrorist groups and to combat Da’esh throughout Libya,  

 Recalling that international law, as reflected in the United Nations Convention 

on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982, sets out the legal framework applicable 

to activities in the ocean, 

 Reiterating its request in resolution 2278 (2016) to the GNA to appoint a focal 

point to brief the Committee at its request and provide informat ion relevant to the 

Committee’s work on the structure of the security forces under its control, 

consolidated procurement procedures, the infrastructure in place to ensure the safe 

storage, registration, maintenance and distribution of military equipment by  the 

Government security forces, and training needs, and emphasizes the importance of 

the GNA exercising control over and safely storing arms, with the support of the 

international community, 

 Affirming that the GNA may submit exemption requests under paragraph 8 of 

resolution 2174 (2014) for the supply, sale or transfer of arms and related materiel, 

including related ammunition and spare parts, for use by the national security forces 

under its control to, inter alia, combat ISIL (the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, 

also known as Da’esh), groups that have pledged allegiance to ISIL, Ansar Al 

Sharia, and other groups associated with Al-Qaida operating in Libya, and calls 

upon the Committee established pursuant to paragraph 24 of resolution 1970 (2011) 

to consider expeditiously such requests in accordance with its rules and procedures,  

 Affirming that, pursuant to paragraph 10 of resolution 2095 (2013), the 

supplies of non-lethal military equipment and the provision of any technical 

assistance, training or financial assistance, when intended solely for security or 

disarmament assistance to the GNA and the national security forces under its 

control, shall be exempt from prior notification to and approval by the Committee,  

 Taking note of the final report of the Panel of Experts S/2016/209 established 

by paragraph 24 of resolution 1973 (2011) and modified by resolution 2040 (2012) 

submitted pursuant to paragraph 24 (d) of resolution 2213 (2015), and the findings 

and recommendations contained therein, in particular the Panel’s report of regular 

violations of the arms embargo despite reinforcement of the measures,  

 Taking note of the decision of the Council of the European Union on 23 May 

2016 to extend the mandate of EUNAVFOR MED Operation Sophia by one year 

and to add further supporting tasks to its mandate, including the implementation of 

the UN arms embargo on the high seas off the coast of Libya,  

 Mindful of its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international 

peace and security under the Charter of the United Nations,  

 Reaffirming its determination that terrorism, in all forms and manifestations, 

constitutes one of the most serious threats to peace and security,
