criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivations, whenever and by 
whomsoever committed, and reiterating its unequivocal condemnation of Al-Qaida

ongoing and multiple criminal terrorist acts aimed at causing the deaths of innocent

stability, 

 Reaffirming that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any 
religion, nationality or civilization,

approach involving the active participation and collaboration of all States, and 
international and regional organizations to impede, impair, isolate and incapacitate 
the terrorist threat,

Ombudsperson is able to continue to carry out its role effectively, in accordance 
with its mandate, and recalling also the Presidential Statement of the Security 
Council (S/PRST/2011/5) of 28 February 2011,
