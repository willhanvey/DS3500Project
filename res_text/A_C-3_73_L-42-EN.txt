 4. Notes the approval by the Parliament of the Islamic Republic of Iran of the

reduction so far in the number of executions for drug-related crimes, at the alarmingly 

high frequency of the imposition and carrying-out of the death penalty by the Islamic

of the death penalty against minors and persons who at the time of their offence were 

under the age of 18, in violation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child,5 and

safeguards, including executions undertaken without notification of the prisoner ’s 

family members or legal counsel, and calls upon the Government of the Islamic

Penal Code, the constitutional guarantees of the Islamic Republic of Iran and 

international obligations;  

 12. Urges the Islamic Republic of Iran to cease the widespread and systematic 

use of arbitrary detention, including the use of this practice to target dual and foreign 

nationals, to release those who have been arbitrarily detained and to uphold, in law 

and in practice, procedural guarantees to ensure fair trial standards, including timely

widespread and serious restrictions, in law and in practice, on the right to freedom of 

expression and opinion, including in digital contexts, and the right to freedom of 

association and peaceful assembly, and to end its harassment, intimidation and 

persecution of political opponents, human rights defenders, women’s and minority

enable women’s participation in political and other decision-making processes, and, 

while recognizing the high enrolment of women in all levels of education in the
