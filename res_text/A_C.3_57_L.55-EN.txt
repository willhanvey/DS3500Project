essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State,

Reaffirming that everyone is entitled to a social and international order in
which the rights and freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights2 can be fully realized,

Reaffirming also the determination expressed in the Preamble to the Charter to
save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, to establish conditions under
which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources
of international law can be maintained, to promote social progress and better
standards of life in larger freedom, to practice tolerance and good neighbourliness,
and to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social
advancement of all peoples,

Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the
aspirations of all peoples for an international order based on the principles enshrined
in the Charter, including promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms for all and respect for the principle of equal rights and self-
determination of peoples, peace, democracy, justice, equality, the rule of law,
pluralism, development, better standards of living and solidarity,

Considering also that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims
that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone
is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein, without distinction of any
kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national
or social origin, property, birth or other status,

Reaffirming that democracy, development and respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing, and that
democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own
political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in all
aspects of their lives,

Emphasizing that democracy is not only a political concept but that it also has
economic and social dimensions,

Recognizing that democracy, respect for all human rights, including the right to
development, transparent and accountable governance and administration in all
sectors of society, and effective participation by civil society are an essential part of
the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred
sustainable development,

Noting with concern that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related
intolerance may be aggravated by, inter alia, inequitable distribution of wealth,
marginalization and social exclusion,

Underlining that it is imperative for the international community to ensure that
globalization becomes a positive force for all the world’s people, and that only
through broad and sustained efforts, based on common humanity in all its diversity,
can globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable,

Stressing that efforts to make globalization fully inclusive and equitable must
include policies and measures, at the global level, that correspond to the needs of
developing countries and countries with economies in transition and are formulated
and implemented with their effective participation,
