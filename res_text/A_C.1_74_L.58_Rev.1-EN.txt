 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 71/31 and 71/32 of 5 December 2016, 71/90 of 

6 December 2016, 72/250 of 24 December 2017, 73/6 of 26 October 2018, 73/91 of 

7 December 2018 and its decision 73/512 of 5 December 2018, as well as its other 

resolutions and decisions on this subject,  

 Recognizing the catastrophic consequences of the weaponization of outer space 

or any military conflicts in outer space and that the prevention of an arms race in 

outer space would avert a grave danger for international peace and security,  

 Emphasizing the importance of article IV of the Treaty on Principles Governing 

the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon 

and Other Celestial Bodies,1 

 Bearing in mind that all Member States, in particular those with major space 

capabilities, should contribute actively to the prevention of an arms race in outer 

space with a view to promoting and strengthening international cooperation in the 

exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes, with the objective of shap ing 

a community of shared future for humankind,  

 Recognizing that, while the existing international treaties related to outer space 

and the legal regime provided for therein play a positive role in regulating outer space 

activities, they are unable to fully prevent the placement of weapons in outer space

and therefore avert an arms race there, and that there is a need to consolidate and 

reinforce this regime, 

 Expressing serious concern over the plans declared by certain States that include 

the placement of weapons, in particular strike combat systems, in outer space,  

 Convinced that further measures should be examined in the search for effective 

and verifiable bilateral and multilateral agreements in order to prevent the 

weaponization of outer space and, as a consequence, an arms race in outer space,  

 Welcoming, in this regard, the draft treaty on the prevention of the placement of 

weapons in outer space and of the threat or use of force against outer space objects, 

introduced by China and the Russian Federation at the Conference on Disarmament 

in 2008,2 and the submission of its updated version in 2014, 3 

 Stressing the importance of the political statements made by a number of States 4 

that they would not be the first to place weapons in outer space,  

 Recognizing the primary role and responsibility of the Conference on 

Disarmament in the negotiation of a multilateral agreement or agreements on the 

prevention of an arms race in outer space,  

 1. Welcomes the deliberations held in 2018 and 2019 by the Group of 

Governmental Experts on Further Practical Measures for the Prevention of an Arms 

Race in Outer Space, which is tasked with considering and making recommendations 

on substantial elements of an international legally binding instrument on the 

prevention of an arms race in outer space, including, inter alia, on the prevention of 

the placement of weapons in outer space;  

 2. Emphasizes that the work of the Group of Governmental Experts has 

constituted an important contribution to international efforts to co nclude the above-

mentioned international legally binding instrument;  

 3. Expresses regret that, due to the position of one expert, consensus could 

not be reached on the final report of the Group of Governmental Experts;  

 4. Recommends that the work of the Group of Governmental Experts be taken 

into account in the search for further practical measures for the prevention of an arms 

race in outer space, in particular in the course of future negotiations at the Conference 

on Disarmament on the international legally binding instrument in this regard;  

 5. Requests the former Chair of the Group of Governmental Experts to report 

to the relevant multilateral forums, including the First Committee, the Conference on 

Disarmament, the Disarmament Commission and the Committee on the Peaceful Uses 

of Outer Space, on the work done by the Group;  

 6. Urges the international community to continue its efforts aimed at 

preventing an arms race, including the placement of weapons, in outer space, with a 

view to maintaining international peace and strengthening global security;  

 7. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-fifth session, 

under the item entitled “Prevention of an arms race in outer space”, the sub-item 

entitled “Further practical measures for the prevention of an arms race in outer space”.
