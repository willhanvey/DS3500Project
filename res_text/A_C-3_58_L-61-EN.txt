confidence in representational governance and contributes to greater national peace
and stability,

Recalling the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted on 10 December
1948,1 in particular the principle that the will of the people as expressed through
periodic and genuine elections shall be the basis of government authority, as well as

will be reported comprehensively and consistently;
