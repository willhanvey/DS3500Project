 Recalling its previous resolutions and statements on the Central African

territorial integrity of the CAR, and recalling the importance of the principles of 
non-interference, good-neighbourliness and regional cooperation,  

 Expressing deep concern at the continuing deterioration of the security 
situation in the CAR, characterized by a total breakdown in law and order, the 
absence of the rule of law, religiously motivated targeted killings and arson, and 
further expressing its grave concern about the consequences of instability in the 
CAR, on the central African region and beyond, and stressing in this regard the need 
for the international community to respond swiftly, 

 Condemning the attacks occurring in the CAR and, in particular those that 
have taken place since 5 December 2013 in Bangui which left more than 1000 
people dead and hundreds of thousands persons internally displaced, and which have 
triggered widespread violence between Christian and Muslim communities across 
the country, 

 Remaining seriously concerned by multiple and increasing violations of 
international humanitarian law and the widespread human rights violations and 
abuses, including those involving extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, 
arbitrary arrests and detention, torture, sexual violence against women and children, 
rape, recruitment and use of children and attacks against civilians and attacks 
against places of worship, committed by both former Seleka elements and militia 
groups, in particular those known as the “anti-Balaka”, 

 Alarmed by the increasing cycle of violence and retaliation and degeneration 
into a countrywide religious and ethnic divide, with the potential to spiral into an 
uncontrollable situation, including serious crimes under international law in 
particular war crimes and crimes against humanity, with serious regional 
implications,
