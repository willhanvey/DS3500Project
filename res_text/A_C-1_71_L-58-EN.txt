  Netherlands: draft resolution  
 

 

  National legislation on transfer of arms, military equipment and 

dual-use goods and technology  
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recognizing that disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation are essential 

for the maintenance of international peace and security,  

 Recalling that effective national control of the transfer of arms, military 

equipment and dual-use goods and technology, including those transfers that could 

contribute to proliferation activities, is an important tool for achieving those 

objectives, 

 Recalling also that the States parties to the international disarmament and 

non-proliferation treaties have undertaken to facilitate the fullest possible exchange 

of materials, equipment and technological information for peaceful purposes, in 

accordance with the provisions of those treaties,  

 Considering that the exchange of national legislation, regulations and 

procedures on the transfer of arms, military equipment and dual-use goods and 

technology contributes to mutual understanding and confidence among Member 

States,  

 Convinced that such an exchange would be beneficial to Member States that 

are in the process of developing such legislation, 

 Welcoming the electronic database established by the Office for Disarmament 

Affairs of the Secretariat, in which all information exchanged pursuant to General 

Assembly resolutions 57/66 of 22 November 2002, 58/42 of 8 December 2003, 

59/66 of 3 December 2004, 60/69 of 8 December 2005, 62/26 of 5 December 2007, 

64/40 of 2 December 2009, 66/41 of 2 December 2011 and 68/44 of 5 December 

2013, entitled “National legislation on transfer of arms, military equipment and 

dual-use goods and technology”, can be consulted,

 Welcoming also the adoption by the General Assembly and the entry into force 

of the Arms Trade Treaty
1
 on 2 April 2013 and 24 December 2014, respectively, and 

noting that the Treaty remains open for accession by any State that has not signed it,  

 Considering that, as long as not all States that report to the electronic database 

established by the Office for Disarmament Affairs have become party to the Treaty, 

the database will retain its added value,  

 Reaffirming the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence in 

accordance with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 1. Invites Member States that are in a position to do so, without prejudice to 

the provisions contained in Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) of 28 April 

2004 and subsequent relevant Council resolutions, to enact or improve national 

legislation, regulations and procedures to exercise effective control over the transfer 

of arms, military equipment and dual-use goods and technology, while ensuring that 

such legislation, regulations and procedures are consistent with the obligations of 

States parties under international treaties, such as the Arms Trade Treaty;
1
 

 2. Encourages Member States to provide, on a voluntary basis, information 

to the Secretary-General on their national legislation, regulations and procedures on 

the transfer of arms, military equipment and dual-use goods and technology, as well 

as the changes therein, and requests the Secretary-General to make that information 

accessible to Member States; 

 3. Decides to remain attentive to the matter.
