17-23111 2/13 

 

 Reaffirming that Member States must ensure that any measures taken to counter 

terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, in particular 

international human rights law, international refugee law, and international 

humanitarian law, underscoring that respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms 

and the rule of law are complementary and mutually reinforcing with effective 

counter-terrorism measures, and are an essential part of a successful counter-terrorism 

effort and notes the importance of respect for the rule of law so as to effectively 

prevent and combat terrorism, and noting that failure to comply with these and other 

international obligations, including under the Charter of the United Nations, is one of 

the factors contributing to increased radicalization to violence and fosters a sense of 

impunity, 

 Stressing that terrorism can only be defeated by a sustained and comprehensive 

approach involving the active participation and collaboration of all States and 

international and regional organizations to impede, impair, isolate, and incapacitate 

the terrorist threat,  

 Urging Member States and the United Nations system to take measures, 

pursuant to international law, to address all drivers of violent extremism conducive to 

terrorism, both internal and external, in a balanced manner as set out in the United 

Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy,  

 Recalling Resolution 2178 and the definition of foreign terrorist fighters, and 

expressing grave concern over the acute and growing threat posed by foreign terrorist 

fighters returning or relocating, particularly from conflict zones, to their countries of 

origin or nationality, or to third countries,  

 Reaffirming its call on Member States to ensure, in conformity with 

international law, that refugee status is not abused by the perpetrators, organizers or 

facilitators of terrorist acts, and that claims of political motivation are not recognized 

as grounds for refusing requests for the extradition of alleged terrorists,  

 Expressing continued concern that international networks have been established 

and strengthened by terrorists and terrorist entities among states of origin, transit, and 

destination, through which foreign terrorist fighters and the resources to support them 

have been channelled back and forth,  

 Acknowledging that returning and relocating foreign terrorist fighters have 

attempted, organized, planned, or participated in attacks in their countries of origin 

or nationality, or third countries, including against “soft” targets, and that the Islamic 

State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) also known as Da’esh, in particular has called on 

its supporters and affiliates to carry out attacks wherever they are located,  

 Stressing the need for Member States to develop, review, or amend national risk 

and threat assessments to take into account “soft” targets in order to develop 

appropriate contingency and emergency response plans for terrorist attacks,  

 Expressing grave concern that foreign terrorist fighters who have joined entities 

such as (ISIL), the Al-Nusrah Front (ANF) and other cells, affiliates, splinter groups 

or derivatives of ISIL, Al-Qaida or other terrorist groups, may be seeking to return to 

their countries of origin or nationality, or to relocate to third countries, and 

recognizing that the threat of returning or relocating foreign terrorist fighters includes, 

among others, such individuals further supporting acts or activities of ISIL, Al -Qaida 

and their cells, affiliates, splinter groups, and derivative entities, including by 

recruiting for or otherwise providing continued support for such entities, and stressing 

the urgent need to address this particular threat,  

 Having regard to and highlighting  the situation of individuals of more than one 

nationality who travel abroad for the purpose of the perpetration, planning, 



 
S/2017/1051 

 

3/13 17-23111 

 

preparation of, or participation in, terrorist acts or the providing or receiving of 

terrorist training, and may seek to return to their state of origin or nationality, or to 

travel to a third state, and urging States to take action, as appropriate, in compliance 

with their obligations under their domestic law and international law, including 

international human rights law,  

 Underlining the importance of strengthening international cooperation to 

address the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters, including on information 

sharing, border security, investigations, judicial processes, extradition, improving 

prevention and addressing conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism, preventing 

and countering incitement to commit terrorist acts, preventing radicalization to 

terrorism and recruitment of foreign terrorist fighters, disrupting, preventing financial 

support to foreign terrorist fighters, developing and implementing risks assessments 

on returning and relocating foreign terrorist fighters and their families, and 

prosecution, rehabilitation and reintegration efforts, consistent with applicable 

international law,  

 Recognizing, in this regard, that foreign terrorist fighters may be travelling with 

family members they brought with them to conflict zones, with families they have 

formed or family members who were born while in conflict zones, underscoring the 

need for Member States to assess and investigate these individuals for any potential 

involvement in criminal or terrorist activities, including by employing evidence-

based risk assessments , and to take appropriate action in compliance with relevant 

domestic and international law, including by considering appropriate prosecution, 

rehabilitation, and reintegration measures, and noting that children may be especially 

vulnerable to radicalization to violence and in need of particular social support, such 

as post-trauma counselling, while stressing that children need to be treated in a 

manner that observes their rights and respects their dignity, in accordance with 

applicable international law,  

 Noting with concern that terrorists craft distorted narratives, which are utilized 

to polarize communities, recruit supporters and foreign terrorist fighters, mobilize 

resources and garner support from sympathizers, in particular by exploiting 

information and communications technologies, including through the Internet and 

social media, 

 Encouraging Member States to collaborate in the pursuit of effective counter-

narrative strategies and initiatives, including those relating to foreign terrorist fighters 

and individuals radicalized to violence, in a manner compliant with their obligations 

under international law, including international human rights law, international 

refugee law and international humanitarian law,  

 Calling upon Member States to improve timely information sharing, through 

appropriate channels and arrangements, and consistent with international and 

domestic law, on foreign terrorist fighters, especially among law enforcement, 

intelligence, counterterrorism, and special services agencies, to aid in determining the 

risk foreign terrorist fighters pose, and preventing them from planning, directing, 

conducting, or recruiting for or inspiring others to commit terrorist attacks,  

 Recognizing that Member States face challenges in obtaining admissible 

evidence, including digital and physical evidence, from conflict zones that can be 

used to help prosecute and secure the conviction of foreign terrorist fighters and those 

supporting foreign terrorist fighters,  

 Welcoming the establishment of the UN Office on Counterterrorism (UNOCT), 

and encouraging continued cooperation on counterterrorism efforts between UNOCT, 

the Counter Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED), International Civi l 

Aviation Organization (ICAO), and United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime 



S/2017/1051 
 

 

17-23111 4/13 

 

(UNODC), and all other relevant UN bodies, and INTERPOL, on technical assistance 

and capacity building, in coordination with other relevant international, regional and 

subregional organizations, to assist Member States in implementing the Global 

Counter Terrorism Strategy,  

 Welcoming recent developments and initiatives at the international, regional and 

subregional levels to prevent and suppress international terrorism, including t he UN 

Counter-terrorism Committee’s 2015 Madrid Guiding Principles, and noting the 

ongoing work of the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF), in particular its 2016 

adoption of the Hague-Marrakech Memorandum Addendum on Good Practices for a 

More Effective Response to the FTF Phenomenon with a focus on Returning FTFs 

and its comprehensive set of good practices to address the foreign terrorist fighter 

phenomenon, and its publication of several other framework documents and good 

practices, including in the areas of countering violent extremism conducive to 

terrorism, including online, criminal justice, prosecution, rehabilitation and 

reintegration, soft target protection, kidnapping for ransom, providing support to 

victims of terrorism, and community-oriented policing to assist interested States with 

the practical implementation of the United Nations counter-terrorism legal and policy 

framework and to complement the work of the relevant United Nations counter-

terrorism entities in these areas,  

 Expressing concern that Foreign Terrorist Fighters may use civil aviation both 

as a means of transportation and as a target, and may use cargo both to target civil 

aviation and as a means of shipment of materiel, and noting in this regard that 

International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Annex 9 and Annex 17 to the 

Convention on International Civil Aviation, done at Chicago on December 7, 1944 

(the “Chicago Convention”), contain standards and recommended practices relevant 

to the detection and prevention of terrorist threats involving civil aviation, including 

cargo screening,  

 Welcoming, in this regard, ICAO’s decision to establish a standard under 

Annex 9 — Facilitation, regarding the use of Advance Passenger Information (API) 

systems by its Member States with effect from October 23, 2017, and recognizing that 

many ICAO Member States have yet to implement this standard,  

 Noting with concern that terrorists and terrorist groups continue to use the 

Internet for terrorist purposes, and stressing the need for Member States to act 

cooperatively when taking national measures to prevent terrorists from exploiting 

technology and communications for terrorist acts, as well as to continue voluntary 

cooperation with private sector and civil society to develop and implement more 

effective means to counter the use of the Internet for terrorist purposes, including by 

developing counter-terrorist narratives and through innovative technological 

solutions, all while respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms and in 

compliance with domestic and international law, and taking note of the industry led 

Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT) and calling for the GIFCT to 

continue to increase engagement with governments and technology companies 

globally,  

 Recognizing the development of the UN CTED-ICT4 Peace Tech Against 

Terrorism initiative and its efforts to foster collaboration with representatives from 

the technology industry, including smaller technology companies, civil society, 

academia, and government to disrupt terrorists’ ability to use the Internet in 

furtherance of terrorist purposes, while also respecting human rights and fundamental 

freedoms,  

 Noting with appreciation the efforts of INTERPOL, to address the threat posed 

by foreign terrorist fighters, including through global law enforcement information 

sharing enabled by the use of its secure communications network, databases, and 



 
S/2017/1051 

 

5/13 17-23111 

 

system of advisory notices and procedures to track stolen, forged identity papers and 

travel documents, and INTERPOL’s counter-terrorism fora and foreign terrorist 

fighter programme,  

 Recognizing that relevant information, including information included in 

INTERPOL databases from Member States, should be shared among national 

agencies, such that law enforcement, judicial and border securit y officers can 

proactively and systematically use that information as a resource, where appropriate 

and necessary, for investigations, prosecutions and screening at points of entry,  

 Recognizing that a comprehensive approach to the threat posed by foreign 

terrorist fighters requires addressing the conditions conducive to the spread of 

terrorism, including by preventing radicalization to terrorism, stemming recruitment, 

disrupting financial support to terrorists, countering incitement to commit terrorist 

acts, and promoting political and religious tolerance, good governance, economic 

development, social cohesion and inclusiveness, ending and resolving armed 

conflicts, and facilitating investigation, prosecution, reintegration and rehabilitation,  

 Reaffirming its request in paragraph 2 of resolution 2379 (2017), to establish an 

investigative team, to be headed by a Special Adviser, to support domestic efforts to 

hold ISIL (Da’esh) accountable by collecting, preserving, and storing evidence in Iraq 

of acts that may amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide 

committed by the terrorist group ISIL (Daesh) in Iraq, and recalling its invitation in 

paragraph 29 of resolution 2388 to the Secretary-General to ensure that the work of 

the Investigative Team is informed by relevant anti-trafficking research and expertise 

and that its efforts to collect evidence on trafficking in persons offences are gender -

sensitive, victim centred, trauma-informed, rights-based and not prejudicial to the 

safety and security of victims,  

 Acknowledging that prisons can serve as potential incubators for radicalization 

to terrorism and terrorist recruitment, and that proper assessment and monitoring of 

imprisoned foreign terrorist fighters is critical to mitigate opportunities for terrorists 

to attract new recruits, recognizing that prisons can also serve to rehabilitate and 

reintegrate prisoners, where appropriate, and also recognizing that Member States 

may need to continue to engage with offenders after release from prison to avoid 

recidivism, in accordance with relevant international law and taking into 

consideration, where appropriate, the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for 

the Treatment of Prisoners, or “Nelson Mandela Rules”, 

 Noting that some member states may face technical assistance and capacity 

building challenges when implementing this resolution, and encouraging the 

provision of assistance from donor states to help address such gaps,  

 Encouraging relevant UN entities, including UNODC and UNOCT, to further 

enhance, in close consultation with the Counter-Terrorism Committee and CTED, the 

provision and delivery of technical assistance to States, upon request, to better support 

Member State efforts to implement this resolution, 

 

  Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations  
 

 1. Recalls its decision in resolution 2178 that all Member States shall 

establish serious criminal offenses regarding the travel, recruitment, and financing of 

foreign terrorist fighters, urges Member States to fully implement their obligations in 

this regard, including to ensure that their domestic laws and regulations establish 

serious criminal offenses sufficient to provide the ability to prosecute and to penalize 

in a manner duly reflecting the seriousness of the offense, and reiterates its call on 

Member States to cooperate and support each other’s efforts to counter violent 

extremism conducive to terrorism;

whom they have reasonable grounds to believe are terrorists, including suspected 

foreign terrorist fighters, and distinguish them from other individuals, including their 

accompanying family members who may not have been engaged in foreign terrorist 

fighter-related offenses, including by employing evidence-based risk assessments, 

screening procedures, and the collection and analysis of travel data, in accordance 

with domestic and international law, including international human rights and 

humanitarian law, as applicable, without resorting to profiling based on any 

discriminatory ground prohibited by international law;  

 5. Calls upon Member States, in accordance with domestic and international 

law, to intensify and accelerate the timely exchange of relevant operational 

information and financial intelligence regarding actions or movements, and patterns 

of movements, of terrorists or terrorist networks, including foreign terrorist fighters, 

including those who have travelled to the conflict zones or are suspected to have 

travelled to the conflict zones, and their families travelling back to their countries of 

origin or nationality, or to third countries, from conflict zones, especially the 

exchange of information with their countries of origin, residence or nationality,
