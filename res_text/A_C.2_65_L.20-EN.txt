Conference on Financing for Development,3 the Doha Declaration on Financing for 
Development, adopted as the outcome document of the Follow-up International 
Conference on Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the 
Monterrey Consensus4 and other relevant outcomes of major United Nations 
conferences and summits, 

 Concerned over the multiple interrelated and mutually exacerbating current 
global crises, in particular the world financial and economic crisis, the volatile 
energy prices, the food crisis and the challenges posed by climate change, which 
have a negative impact on the development prospects of developing countries and 
which threaten to further widen the gap between developed and developing 
countries, including the technological and income gap, and could further undermine 
the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the 
Millennium Development Goals, 

 Underlining the need for a more sustainable economic growth and recovery, 
and recognizing that this goal can be achieved through inclusive multilateralism and 
the equal participation of all countries, as envisioned, inter alia, in the Declaration 
and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International 
Economic Order, 

 Recognizing that innovative and enhanced approaches to financing for 
development are needed to address the challenges posed by the current global 
economic situation, poverty and the achievement of the internationally agreed 
development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, and stressing that 
these new approaches should neither substitute nor negatively affect the level of 
traditional sources of development financing, including official development 
assistance, and need to be developed in a spirit of partnership, cooperation and 
solidarity, bearing in mind the common interests and national priorities of each 
country, 

 Recognizing also that many relevant principles contained in the Declaration 
and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International 
Economic Order have not been fully realized and that enhanced efforts are needed to 
minimize the negative effects of globalization on developing countries and ensure 
that it works as a positive force for all, in particular for developing countries, 

 Recognizing further that widespread financial deregulation has contributed to 
larger net capital outflows from developing countries to developed countries, 

 Stressing the need for policy space to allow the formulation of national 
development strategies by developing countries, aimed at bringing prosperity for all, 

 Reaffirming the need to enhance the voice and participation of developing 
countries in international economic decision-making and norm-setting, 

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General entitled “An overview 
of the major economic and policy challenges for equitable and inclusive sustained

 2. Reaffirms the need to continue working towards a new international

 3. Decides to continue considering the international economic situation and 
its impact on development and in that regard requests the Secretary-General to

item entitled “Globalization and interdependence”, an updated overview of the 
major international economic and policy challenges for equitable and inclusive 
sustained economic growth and sustainable development and of the role of the 
United Nations in addressing these issues, as well as possible ways and means to 
overcome those challenges, bearing in mind the outcomes of the major United 
Nations conferences and summits in the economic, social and related fields and the 
principles contained therein, in the light of the relevant principles contained in the 
Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and the 
Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.
