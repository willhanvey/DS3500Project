humanitarian organizations, to address the catastrophic consequences of nuclear

 Welcoming the facts-based discussions on the effects of a nuclear weapon 

detonation that were held at the conferences on the humanitarian impact of nuclear 

weapons, convened by Norway, on 4 and 5 March 2013, Mexico, on 13 and 

14 February 2014, and Austria, on 8 and 9 December 2014,  

 Cognizant that a key message from experts and international organizations at 

those conferences was that no State or international body could address the 

immediate humanitarian emergency caused by a nuclear weapon detonation or 

provide adequate assistance to victims,  

 Firmly believing that it is in the interest of all States to engage in discussions 

on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons with the aim of further 

broadening and deepening the understanding of this matter, and welcoming civil 

society’s ongoing engagement, 

 Reaffirming the role of civil society, in partnership with Governments, in 

raising awareness about the unacceptable humanitarian consequences of nuclear 

weapons, 

 Emphasizing that the catastrophic consequences of nuclear weapons affect not 

only Governments but each and every citizen of our interconnected world and have 

deep implications for human survival, for the environment, for socioeconomic 

development, for our economies and for the health of future generations,  

 1. Stresses that it is in the interest of the very survival of humanity that 

nuclear weapons never be used again, under any circumstances;  

 2. Emphasizes that the only way to guarantee that nuclear weapons will 

never be used again is their total elimination;  

 3. Stresses that the catastrophic effects of a nuclear weapon detonation, 

whether by accident, miscalculation or design, cannot be adequately addressed;
