population within and into and out of the Gaza Strip,   

 Expressing grave concern about the continuing systematic violation of the 

human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel, the occupying Power, including 

that arising from the excessive use of force and military operations causing death 

and injury to Palestinian civilians, including children, women and non-violent, 

peaceful demonstrators; the arbitrary imprisonment and detention of Palestinians, 

some of whom have been imprisoned for decades; the use of collective punishment; 

the closure of areas; the confiscation of land; the establishment and expansion of 

settlements; the construction of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory in 

departure from the Armistice Line of 1949; the destruction of property and 

infrastructure; the forced displacement of civilians; and all other actions by it 

designed to change the legal status, geographical nature and demographic 

composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem,   

 Deploring the conflict in and around the Gaza Strip in July and August 2014 

and the civilian causalities caused, including the killing and injury of thousands of 

Palestinian civilians, including children, women and the elderly, the widespread 

destruction of thousands of homes and civilian infrastructure, including schools, 

hospitals, water, sanitation and electricity networks, economic, indus trial and 

agricultural properties, public institutions, religious sites, and United Nations 

schools and facilities, the internal displacement of hundreds of thousands of 

civilians, and any violations of international law, including humanitarian and human 

rights law, in this regard,  

 Gravely concerned about the disastrous humanitarian situation and the critical 

socioeconomic and security situation in the Gaza Strip, including that resulting from 

the prolonged closures and severe economic and movement restrictions that in effect 

amount to a blockade and from the continuing and vastly negative repercussions of 

the military operations between December 2008 and January 2009, in November 

2012 and in July and August 2014, as well as about the firing of rockets into Israel,

ES-10/18 of 16 January 2009,  

 Stressing also that the situation in the Gaza Strip is unsustainable and that a 

durable ceasefire agreement must lead to a fundamental improvement in the living 

conditions of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip, including through the 

sustained and regular opening of crossing points, and ensure the safety and well -

being of civilians on both sides,

Conflict,12 and reiterating the necessity for serious follow-up by all parties of the 

recommendations addressed to them towards ensuring accountability and justice,   

 Expressing deep concern about the short- and long-term detrimental impact of 

such widespread destruction and the continued impeding of the reconstruction 

process by Israel, the occupying Power, on the human rights situation and on the 

socioeconomic and humanitarian conditions of the Palestinian civilian population,   

 Expressing deep concern also about the Israeli policy of closures and the 

imposition of severe restrictions, including through hundreds of obstacles to 

movement, checkpoints and a permit regime, all of which obstruct the freedom of 

movement of persons and goods, including medical and humanitarian goods, 

throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and impair 

the Territory’s contiguity, consequently violating the human rights of the Palestinian 

people and negatively impacting their socioeconomic situation and the efforts aimed 

at rehabilitating and developing the Palestinian economy, which remains that of a 

critical humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, while taking note of recent 

developments with regard to the situation of access there,   

 Expressing grave concern that thousands of Palestinians, including many 

children and women, continue to be held in Israeli prisons or detention centres under 

harsh conditions, including, inter alia, unhygienic conditions, solitary confinement, 

the extensive use of administrative detention of excessive duration without charge and 

denial of due process, lack of proper medical care and widespread medical neglect, 

including for prisoners who are ill, with the risk of fatal consequences, and denial of 

family visits, that impair their well-being, and expressing grave concern also about 

the ill-treatment and harassment and all reports of torture of any Palestinian prisoners,   

 Expressing deep concern about the recent hunger strikes by numerous 

Palestinian prisoners in protest of the harsh conditions of their imprisonment and 

detention by the occupying Power, while taking note of the agreement reached in 

May 2012 on conditions of detention in Israeli prisons and calling for its full and 

immediate implementation,  

 Expressing concern about the possible consequences of the enactment by Israel,  

the occupying Power, of military orders regarding the detention, imprisonment and 

deportation of Palestinian civilians from the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including  

East Jerusalem, and recalling in this regard the prohibition under international 

humanitarian law of the deportation of civilians from occupied territories,   

 Stressing the need for the prevention of all acts of violence, harassment, 

provocation and incitement by extremist Israeli settlers, especially against 

Palestinian civilians, including children, and their properties, including homes, 

agricultural lands and historic and religious sites, and expressing deep concern 

about the violation of the human rights of Palestinians in this regard,  

 Convinced of the need for an international presence to monitor the situation, to 

contribute to ending the violence and protecting the Palestinian civilian population 

and to help the parties to implement the agreements reached, and in this regard 

recalling the positive contribution of the Temporary International Presence in Hebron,
