15 November 2005, to allow for the freedom of movement of the Palestinian civilian 
population within and into and out of the Gaza Strip,  

 Expressing grave concern about the continuing systematic violation of the 
human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel, the occupying Power, including 
that arising from the excessive use of force and military operations causing death 
and injury to Palestinian civilians, including children, women and non-violent, 
peaceful demonstrators; the arbitrary imprisonment and detention of Palestinians, 
some of whom have been imprisoned for decades; the use of collective punishment; 
the closure of areas; the confiscation of land; the establishment and expansion of 
settlements; the construction of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory in 
departure from the Armistice Line of 1949; the destruction of property and 
infrastructure; the forced displacement of civilians; and all other actions by it 
designed to change the legal status, geographical nature and demographic 
composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem,  

 Gravely concerned in particular about the critical humanitarian, 
socioeconomic and security situation in the Gaza Strip, including that resulting from 
the prolonged closures and severe economic and movement restrictions that in effect 
amount to a blockade and from the continuing negative repercussions of the military 
operations between December 2008 and January 2009, which caused extensive loss 
of life and injury, particularly among Palestinian civilians, including children and 
women, widespread destruction and damage to Palestinian homes, properties, vital 
infrastructure and public institutions, including hospitals, schools and United 
Nations facilities, and the internal displacement of civilians, as well as about the 
firing of rockets into Israel,  

 Stressing the need for the full implementation by all parties of Security 
Council resolution 1860 (2009) of 8 January 2009 and General Assembly resolution 
ES-10/18 of 16 January 2009,  

 Gravely concerned by reports regarding serious human rights violations and 
grave breaches of international humanitarian law committed during the military 
operations in the Gaza Strip between December 2008 and January 2009, including 
the findings in the summary by the Secretary-General of the report of the Board of 
Inquiry10 and in the report of the United Nations Fact-finding Mission on the Gaza 
Conflict,11 and reiterating the necessity for serious follow-up by all parties of the 
recommendations addressed to them towards ensuring accountability and justice, 

 Deploring the loss of civilian lives, including women and children, as a result 
of the hostilities that had been affecting the Gaza Strip and Israel in November 
2012,  

 Expressing deep concern about the short- and long-term detrimental impact of 
such widespread destruction and the continued impeding of the reconstruction 
process by Israel, the occupying Power, on the human rights situation and on the 
socioeconomic and humanitarian conditions of the Palestinian civilian population,  

 Also expressing deep concern about the Israeli policy of closures and the 
imposition of severe restrictions, including through hundreds of obstacles to 
movement, checkpoints and a permit regime, all of which obstruct the freedom of

movement of persons and goods, including medical and humanitarian goods, 
throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and impair 
the Territory’s contiguity, consequently violating the human rights of the Palestinian 
people and negatively impacting their socioeconomic situation and the efforts aimed 
at rehabilitating and developing the Palestinian economy, which remains that of a 
critical humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, while taking note of recent 
developments with regard to the situation of access there, 

 Expressing grave concern that thousands of Palestinians, including many 
children and women, continue to be held in Israeli prisons or detention centres under 
harsh conditions, including, inter alia, unhygienic conditions, solitary confinement, 
the extensive use of administrative detention of excessive duration without charge 
and denial of due process, lack of proper medical care, denial of family visits and 
denial of due process, that impair their well-being, and expressing grave concern 
also about the ill-treatment and harassment of any Palestinian prisoners and all 
reports of torture, 

 Expressing deep concern about the recent hunger strikes by numerous 
Palestinian prisoners in protest of the harsh conditions of their imprisonment and 
detention by the occupying Power, while taking note of the agreement reached in 
May 2012 on conditions of detention in Israeli prisons and calling for its full and 
immediate implementation, 

 Expressing concern about the possible consequences of the enactment by 
Israel, the occupying Power, of military orders regarding the detention, 
imprisonment and deportation of Palestinian civilians from the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem, and recalling in this regard the prohibition 
under international humanitarian law of the deportation of civilians from occupied 
territories, 

 Stressing the need for the prevention of all acts of violence, harassment, 
provocation and incitement by extremist Israeli settlers, especially against 
Palestinian civilians, including children, and their properties, including homes, 
agricultural lands, and historic and religious sites, and expressing deep concern 
about the violation of the human rights of Palestinians in this regard, 

 Convinced of the need for an international presence to monitor the situation, to 
contribute to ending the violence and protecting the Palestinian civilian population 
and to help the parties implement the agreements reached, and in this regard 
recalling the positive contribution of the Temporary International Presence in 
Hebron,  

 Taking note of the continued efforts and tangible progress made in the 
Palestinian security sector, calling upon the parties to continue cooperation that 
benefits both Palestinians and Israelis, in particular by promoting security and 
building confidence, and expressing the hope that such progress will be extended to 
all major population centres, 

 Urging the parties to observe calm and restraint and to refrain from 
provocative actions, incitement and inflammatory rhetoric, especially in areas of 
religious and cultural sensitivity, including in East Jerusalem, and to take every 
possible step to promote conditions conducive to the success of the resumed peace 
negotiations,
