 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions concerning the situation in Somalia, in

resolution 1725 (2006), the statements of its President, in particular those of 13 July 
2006 (S/PRST/2006/31) and 22 December 2006 (S/PRST/2006/59),  

 Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political 
independence and unity of Somalia, 

 Reiterating its commitment to a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the 
situation in Somalia through the Transitional Federal Charter, and stressing the 
importance of broad-based and representative institutions reached through an 
all-inclusive political process, as envisaged in the Transitional Federal Charter, 

 Reiterating its strong support for the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General, Mr. François Fall, 

 Reiterating its appreciation of the efforts of the African Union, the League of 
Arab States and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development to promote peace, 
stability and reconciliation in Somalia, and welcoming their continued engagement 
in this regard, 

 Taking note of the communiqué of the African Union Peace and Security 
Council of 19 January 2007, which states that the African Union shall deploy for a 
period of six months a mission to Somalia (AMISOM), aimed essentially at 
contributing to the initial stabilization phase in Somalia, and that the mission will 
evolve into a United Nations operation that will support the long-term stabilization 
and post-conflict restoration of Somalia, 

 Welcoming the African Union’s intention to establish a mission in Somalia 
and underlining the urgency of the development, 

 Welcoming the decision of Ethiopia to withdraw its troops from Somalia, 
taking note of the fact that Ethiopia has already started withdrawing its troops, and 
underlining that the deployment of AMISOM will help avoid a security vacuum and 
create the conditions for full withdrawal and the lifting of emergency security 
measures currently in place,
