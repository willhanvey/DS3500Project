draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 4 June 2007 (S/2007/328) on 
the United Nations operation in Cyprus, 

 Noting that the Government of Cyprus is agreed that in view of the prevailing 
conditions in the island it is necessary to keep UNFICYP beyond 15 June 2007, 

 Echoing the Secretary-General’s firm belief that the responsibility of finding a 
solution lies first and foremost with the Cypriots themselves and noting the primary 
role of the United Nations in assisting the parties to bring the Cyprus conflict and 
division of the island to a comprehensive and durable settlement,  

 Taking note of the assessment of the Secretary-General that the security 
situation on the island and along the Green Line remains generally stable, but noting 
with concern the increase in the overall number of violations of the buffer zone, and 
urging both sides to avoid any action which could lead to an increase in tension, 

 Underlining that activity in the buffer zone should not be at the expense of 
stability and security, and noting the Secretary-General’s firm belief that the 
situation in the buffer zone would be improved if both sides accepted the 1989 aide-
memoire used by the United Nations, 

 Welcoming the principles and decisions enshrined in the 8 July 2006 
Agreement, stressing that a comprehensive settlement based on a bicommunal, 
bizonal federation and political equality, as set out in the relevant Security Council 
resolutions, is both desirable and possible and should not be further delayed,  

 Noting, with regret, the failure to date to implement the 8 July 2006 
Agreement, and urging the leaders of both communities to act to start the process 
without delay in order to prepare the ground for fully-fledged negotiations leading 
to a comprehensive and durable settlement, 

 Regretting that demining activity in the buffer zone has stalled, welcoming the 
provision by the European Union of funds to support these activities, and urging the 
Turkish Forces and the Turkish Cypriot side to allow the resumption of demining 
activities, 



S/2007/353  
 

07-38405 2 
 

 Reiterating its call to the parties to assess and address the humanitarian issue 
of all missing persons with due urgency and seriousness, and welcoming in this 
regard the progress and continuation of the important activities of the Committee on 
Missing Persons; expressing the hope that this process will promote reconciliation 
between the communities, 

 Welcoming the continuing crossings of the Green Line by Cypriots and 
encouraging further progress on other confidence-building measures, such as the 
opening of additional crossing points including, but not limited to, at Ledra Street, 
taking into account the arrangements already in place at existing crossing points, 

 Welcoming all efforts to promote bicommunal contacts and events, including, 
inter alia, on the part of all United Nations bodies on the island urging the two sides 
to promote the active engagement of civil society and the encouragement of 
cooperation between economic and commercial bodies and to remove all obstacles 
to such contacts, 

 Expressing concern, in this respect, that opportunities for constructive public 
debate about the future of the island, within and between the communities, are 
becoming fewer, and that this atmosphere is hampering, in particular, efforts to 
foster bicommunal activities intended to benefit all Cypriots, and to promote 
reconciliation and build trust in order to facilitate a comprehensive settlement, 

 Reaffirming the importance of the Secretary-General continuing to keep the 
operations of UNFICYP under close review while continuing to take into account 
developments on the ground and the views of the parties, and reverting to the 
Council with recommendations as appropriate for further adjustments to 
UNFICYP’s mandate, force levels and concept of operation as soon as warranted, 

 Noting the unacceptable accommodation conditions endured by many 
UNFICYP troops, and welcoming the recent commitment by the Republic of Cyprus 
to address this issue without delay, 

 Echoing the Secretary-General’s gratitude to the Government of Cyprus and 
the Government of Greece for their voluntary contributions to the funding of 
UNFICYP, and his request for further voluntary contributions from other countries 
and organizations, 

 Welcoming and encouraging efforts by the United Nations to sensitize 
peacekeeping personnel in the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS and other 
communicable diseases in all its peacekeeping operations, 

 1. Welcomes the observations in the Secretary-General’s report; 

 2. Expresses full support for the 8 July process, notes with concern the lack 
of progress, and calls upon all parties to immediately engage constructively with the 
United Nations efforts, as described in Under-Secretary-General Gambari’s letter of 
15 November 2006, to demonstrate measurable progress in order to allow fully-
fledged negotiations to begin, and to cease mutual recriminations; 

 3. Reaffirms all its relevant resolutions on Cyprus, in particular resolution 
1251 (1999) of 29 June 1999 and subsequent resolutions; 

 4. Reaffirms that the status quo is unacceptable, that time is not on the side 
of a settlement, and that negotiations on a final political solution to the Cyprus 
problem have been at an impasse for too long; 



 S/2007/353
 

3 07-38405 
 

 5. Expresses its full support for UNFICYP and decides to extend its 
mandate for a further period ending 15 December 2007; 

 6. Calls on both sides to engage, as a matter of urgency and while 
respecting UNFICYP’s mandate, in consultations with UNFICYP on the 
demarcation of the buffer zone, in particular in relation to the Ledra Street crossing 
point, with a view to reaching agreement on the United Nations 1989 aide-memoire; 

 7. Calls on the Turkish Cypriot side and Turkish forces to restore in 
Strovilia the military status quo which existed there prior to 30 June 2000; 

 8. Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report on implementation of 
this resolution by 1 December 2007; 

 9. Welcomes the efforts being undertaken by UNFICYP to implement the 
Secretary-General’s zero tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and to 
ensure full compliance of its personnel with the United Nations code of conduct, 
requests the Secretary-General to continue to take all necessary action in this regard 
and to keep the Security Council informed, and urges troop-contributing countries to 
take appropriate preventive action including the conduct of predeployment 
awareness training, and to take disciplinary action and other action to ensure full 
accountability in cases of such conduct involving their personnel; 

 10. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
