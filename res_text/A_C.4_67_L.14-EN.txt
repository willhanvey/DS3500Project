 Taking into account the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the 
International Court of Justice on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall 
in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,5 and recalling, in this regard, its resolution  
ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004,  

 Recalling its resolution 58/292 of 6 May 2004,  

 Convinced that occupation itself represents a gross and grave violation of 
human rights,  

 Gravely concerned about the continuing detrimental impact of ongoing 
unlawful Israeli practices and measures in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem, including the excessive use of force by the Israeli 
occupying forces against Palestinian civilians, resulting in the death and injury of 
civilians, the widespread destruction of property and vital infrastructure, ongoing 
settlement activities and construction of the wall, the internal displacement of 
civilians, the imposition of collective punishment measures, particularly against the 
civilian population in the Gaza Strip, where continuing severe restrictions on 
movement amount to a blockade, and the detention and imprisonment of thousands 
of Palestinians, 

 Gravely concerned also about acts of violence, intimidation and provocation 
by Israeli settlers against Palestinian civilians and properties, including homes, 
mosques, churches and agricultural lands, 

 Gravely concerned in particular by reports regarding serious human rights 
violations and grave breaches of international humanitarian law committed during the 
military operations in the Gaza Strip between December 2008 and January 2009, 
including the findings in the summary by the Secretary-General of the report of the 
Board of Inquiry6 and in the report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the 
Gaza Conflict,7 and reiterating the necessity for serious follow-up by all parties to the 
recommendations addressed to them towards ensuring accountability and justice,  

 Having considered the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli 
Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of 
the Occupied Territories8 and the relevant reports of the Secretary-General,9  

 Recalling the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government 
Arrangements of 13 September 199310 and the subsequent implementation agreements 
between the Palestinian and Israeli sides,  

 Stressing the urgency of bringing a complete end to the Israeli occupation that 
began in 1967 and thus an end to the violation of the human rights of the Palestinian 
people, and of allowing for the realization of their inalienable human rights, 
including their right to self-determination and their independent State,  

 Taking note of the application of Palestine for admission to membership in the 
United Nations, submitted on 23 September 2011,11
