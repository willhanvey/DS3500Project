  United States of America: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous relevant resolutions, including resolution 825 (1993), 

resolution 1540 (2004), resolution 1695 (2006), resolution 1718 (2006), resolution 

1874 (2009), resolution 1887 (2009), resolution 2087 (2013), resolution 2094 

(2013), resolution 2270 (2016), and resolution 2321 (2016), as well as the 

statements of its President of 6 October 2006 (S/PRST/2006/41), 13 April 2009 

(S/PRST/2009/7) and 16 April 2012 (S/PRST/2012/13),  

 Reaffirming that proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as 

well as their means of delivery, constitutes a threat to international peace and 

security,

Security Council resolutions through repeated launches and attempted launches of 

ballistic missiles, and noting that all such ballistic missile activities contribute to the 

DPRK’s development of nuclear weapons delivery systems and increase tension in 

the region and beyond, 

 Expressing great concern that the DPRK’s prohibited arms sales have 

generated revenues that are diverted to the pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic 

missiles while DPRK citizens have unmet needs,  

 Expressing its gravest concern that the DPRK’s ongoing nuclear - and ballistic 

missile-related activities have further generated increased tension in the region and 

beyond, and determining that there continues to exist a clear threat to international 

peace and security, 

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, and taking 

measures under its Article 41, 

 1. Condemns in the strongest terms the nuclear weapons and ballistic 

missile development activities including a series of ballistic missile launches and 

other activities conducted by the DPRK since 9 September 2016 in violation and 

flagrant disregard of the Security Council’s resolutions;  

 2. Reaffirms its decisions that the DPRK shall abandon all nuclear weapons 

and existing nuclear programmes in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner, 

and immediately cease all related activities; shall not conduct any further launches 

that use ballistic missile technology, nuclear tests, or any other provocation; shall 

suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile programme and in this context
