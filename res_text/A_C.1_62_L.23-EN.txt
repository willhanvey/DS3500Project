the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons 

 
 
 

  Bangladesh, Cuba, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Kuwait, 
Madagascar, Malaysia, Mauritius, Nepal and Viet Nam: draft resolution 
 
 

  Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Convinced that the use of nuclear weapons poses the most serious threat to the 
survival of mankind, 

 Bearing in mind the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 
8 July 1996 on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons,1  

 Convinced that a multilateral, universal and binding agreement prohibiting the 
use or threat of use of nuclear weapons would contribute to the elimination of the 
nuclear threat and to the climate for negotiations leading to the ultimate elimination 
of nuclear weapons, thereby strengthening international peace and security, 

 Conscious that some steps taken by the Russian Federation and the United 
States of America towards a reduction of their nuclear weapons and the 
improvement in the international climate can contribute towards the goal of the 
complete elimination of nuclear weapons, 

 Recalling that paragraph 58 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special 
Session of the General Assembly2 states that all States should actively participate in 
efforts to bring about conditions in international relations among States in which a 
code of peaceful conduct of nations in international affairs could be agreed upon 
and that would preclude the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, 

 Reaffirming that any use of nuclear weapons would be a violation of the 
Charter of the United Nations and a crime against humanity, as declared in its

resolutions 1653 (XVI) of 24 November 1961, 33/71 B of 14 December 1978, 
34/83 G of 11 December 1979, 35/152 D of 12 December 1980 and 36/92 I of 
9 December 1981, 

 Determined to achieve an international convention prohibiting the 
development, production, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons, leading to their 
ultimate destruction, 

 Stressing that an international convention on the prohibition of the use of 
nuclear weapons would be an important step in a phased programme towards the 
complete elimination of nuclear weapons, with a specified framework of time, 

 Noting with regret that the Conference on Disarmament, during its 2007 
session, was unable to undertake negotiations on this subject as called for in General 
Assembly resolution 61/97 of 6 December 2006, 

 1. Reiterates its request to the Conference on Disarmament to commence 
negotiations in order to reach agreement on an international convention prohibiting 
the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances; 

 2. Requests the Conference on Disarmament to report to the General 
Assembly on the results of those negotiations.
