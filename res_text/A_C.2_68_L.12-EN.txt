  Unilateral economic measures as a means of political and economic

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling the relevant principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, 

 Reaffirming the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning 
Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of 
the United Nations,1 which states, inter alia, that no State may use or encourage the 
use of unilateral economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another 
State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign 
rights, 

 Bearing in mind the general principles governing the international trading 
system and trade policies for development contained in relevant resolutions, rules 
and provisions of the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, 

 Recalling its resolutions 44/215 of 22 December 1989, 46/210 of 20 December 
1991, 48/168 of 21 December 1993, 50/96 of 20 December 1995, 52/181 of 
18 December 1997, 54/200 of 22 December 1999, 56/179 of 21 December 2001, 
58/198 of 23 December 2003, 60/185 of 22 December 2005, 62/183 of 19 December 
2007, 64/189 of 21 December 2009 and 66/186 of 22 December 2011, 

 Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures 
adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries in 
particular and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation 
and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open 
multilateral trading system,

 Recognizing that such measures constitute a flagrant violation of the principles 
of international law as set forth in the Charter, as well as the basic principles of the 
multilateral trading system, 

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;2 

 2. Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective 
measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against 
developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United 
Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the 
Charter of the United Nations and that contravene the basic principles of the 
multilateral trading system; 

 3. Calls upon the international community to condemn and reject the 
imposition of the use of such measures as a means of political and economic 
coercion against developing countries;  

 4. Requests the Secretary-General to continue to monitor the imposition of 
measures of this nature and to study the impact of such measures on the affected 
countries, including the impact on trade and development;  

 5. Also requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at 
its seventieth session a report on the implementation of the present resolution.
