 The Security Council, 

 Noting with concern that the situation in the Middle East is tense and is likely 
to remain so, unless and until a comprehensive settlement covering all aspects of the 
Middle East problem can be reached, 

 Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations 
Disengagement Observer Force of 30 November 2011 (S/2011/748), and also 
reaffirming its resolution 1308 (2000) of 17 July 2000, 

 Expressing grave concern at the serious events that occurred in UNDOF’s area 
of operations on 15 May and 5 June that put the long-held ceasefire in jeopardy, 

 Noting that evolving conditions in the region could have an impact on the 
functioning of the Force, 

 1. Calls upon the parties concerned to implement immediately its resolution 
338 (1973) of 22 October 1973; 

 2. Calls on all parties to cooperate fully with the operations of UNDOF and 
to ensure the security of as well as unhindered and immediate access for the United 
Nations personnel carrying out their mandate, in conformity with existing 
agreements;

1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement, and calls on the parties to exercise 
maximum restraint and prevent any breaches of the ceasefire and the area of 
separation; 

 4. Welcomes the efforts being undertaken by the United Nations 
Disengagement Observer Force to implement the Secretary-General’s zero-tolerance 
policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and to ensure full compliance of its 
personnel with the United Nations code of conduct, requests the Secretary-General 
to continue to take all necessary action in this regard and to keep the Security 
Council informed, and urges troop-contributing countries to take preventive and 
disciplinary action to ensure that such acts are properly investigated and punished in 
cases involving their personnel; 

 5. Welcomes the Secretary-General’s assessment of the operational capacity 
of UNDOF and requests that he take steps to immediately implement the 
recommendations as outlined in paragraph 12 of S/2011/748;

Observer Force for a period of six months, that is, until 30 June 2012;
