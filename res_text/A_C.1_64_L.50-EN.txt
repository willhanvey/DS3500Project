1992, 48/75 E of 16 December 1993, 49/75 C of 15 December 1994, 50/70 D of

matters,

 Welcoming further the inclusion by some Member States of their transfers of

additional background information, 

 Noting the focused discussions on transparency in armaments that took place 
in the Conference on Disarmament in 2009, 

 Noting with concern the reduction in reporting to the United Nations Register 
of Conventional Arms in the last two years,  

 Stressing that the continuing operation of the Register and its further

attracting the widest possible participation,

participation;

build capacity to submit meaningful reports, including capacity to report on small 
arms and light weapons;  

 (d) Requests the Secretary-General, with a view to the three-year cycle
