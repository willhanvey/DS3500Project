advantage of information and communications technologies to carry out criminal 

activities,

combating the use of information and communications technologies for criminal 

purposes, including by providing technical assistance to developing countries upon 

their request to improve national legislation and build the capacity of national 

authorities to deal with such use in all its forms, including its prevention, detection, 

investigation and prosecution, and emphasizing in this context the role that the United 

Nations, in particular the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, 

plays,
