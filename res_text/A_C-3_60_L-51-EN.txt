Commission on Human Rights on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment, including the definition of torture by the Supreme Court in
accordance with the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or
Degrading Treatment or Punishment,2 and the amendment of the Criminal Code to
include torture as a punishable crime;

(c) The statement made by the President of Uzbekistan on 28 January 2005

the judiciary, and calls the Government of Uzbekistan to take steps to allow for its
practical independence, as outlined by the President;

from travelling to a third country;

(c) Reports of arbitrary arrest and detention, including of eyewitnesses to the

expression, particularly harassment, beatings, arrests and threats made against
journalists and civil society activists attempting to document and publicize
information on the events in Andijan;

(e) Continued refusal to permit the registration of opposition political
parties, and their consequent inability to participate in the electoral process;

non-governmental organizations and civil society, including human rights defenders;

both the repeated calls of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights
for the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into the events that
occurred in Andijan on 13 May 2005, and the request of the Special Rapporteur of
the Commission on Human Rights on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions
to visit Uzbekistan soon afterwards;
