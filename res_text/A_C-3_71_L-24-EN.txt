 Condemning the grave deterioration of the human rights situation and the 

indiscriminate killing and deliberate targeting of civilians as such, in violation of 

international humanitarian law, and acts of violence that foment sectarian tensio ns, 

 Noting with deep concern the culture of impunity for serious violations of 

international humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human rights law 

committed during the present conflict, which has provided a fertile ground for 

further violations and abuses, 

 Recalling that, amid expressions of popular discontent over restrictions on the 

enjoyment of civil, political, economic and social rights, civilian protests erupted in 

Dar’a in March 2011, and noting that the excessive and violent oppression of  

civilian protests by the Syrian authorities, which later escalated to the direct shelling 

of civilians, fuelled the escalation of armed violence and extremist groups, 

including so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant ISIL-Da’esh, 

 Expressing outrage at the continuing escalation of violence in the Syrian Arab 

Republic, which has caused more than 400,000 fatalities, including the killing of 

many more than 15,000 children, and in particular at the continued widespread and 

systematic gross violations, as well as abuses, of human rights and violations of 

international humanitarian law, including those involving the continued

3/12 16-18969 

 

indiscriminate use of heavy weapons and aerial bombardments, such as the 

indiscriminate use of ballistic missiles, bunker-busting bombs, cluster munitions 

and barrel and vacuum bombs, and by the starvation of civilians as a method of 

warfare and the use of chlorine gas, which are prohibited under international 

humanitarian law, by the Syrian authorities against the Syrian population,  

 Expressing outrage and grave concern  at the escalation in violence in eastern 

Aleppo as a result of the recent offensive by the Syrian authorities and their allies, 

which has caused hundreds of civilian casualties, including rescue workers, first 

responders, women and more than 100 children and nearly 2,000 injured and has 

included repeated attacks against medical facilities, medical personnel and patients 

and on critical civilian infrastructure,  

 Recalling the specific obligations under international humanitarian law to 

respect and protect, in situations of armed conflict, medical personnel and 

humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means of 

transport and equipment, and hospitals and other medical facilities, and to ensure 

that the wounded and sick receive, to the fullest extent practicable and with the least 

possible delay, the medical care and attention required, and also recalling that, under 

international law, attacks intentionally directed against hospitals and places where 

the sick and wounded are collected, provided that they are not military objectives, 

as well as attacks intentionally directed against buildings, material, medical units 

and transport and personnel using the distinctive emblems of the Geneva 

Conventions in conformity with international law are war crimes,  

 Expressing grave concern at the disproportionate use of force by the Syrian 

authorities against civilians, which has caused immense human suffering and 

fomented the spread of extremism and extremist groups and which demonstrates the 

failure of the Syrian authorities to protect its population and to implement the 

relevant resolutions and decisions of United Nations bodies,  

 Expressing grave concern also at the spread of extremism and extremist 

groups, terrorism and terrorist groups, and strongly condemning all violations and 

abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law committed 

in the Syrian Arab Republic by any party to the conflict, in particular so -called 

ISIL-Da’esh, Al-Nusrah Front and militias fighting on behalf of the regime, 

Al-Qaida-affiliated terrorist groups and other extremist groups,  

 Expressing its deepest concern about the findings of the Organization for the 

Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism 

that the Syrian Arab Armed Forces were responsible for the use of chemical 

weapons in at least three attacks and so-called ISIL-Da’esh was responsible for one 

attack, reaffirming the principles of the Convention on the Prohibition of the 

Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their 

Destruction,
22

 and the determination of the States parties to the Convention “for the 

sake of all mankind, to exclude completely the possibility of the use of chemical 

weapons, through the implementation of the provisions of this Convention”, and 

noting that the Convention entered into force in the Syrian Arab Republic on 

14 October 2013,

 Expressing support for the work carried out by the Independent International 

Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, and strongly condemning the 

lack of cooperation by the Syrian authorities with the Commission of Inquiry,  

 Noting with serious concern the observation of the Commission of Inquiry 

that, since March 2011, the Syrian authorities have conducted widespread attacks 

against the civilian population as a matter of policy,  

 Strongly condemning the widespread practice of enforced disappearance, 

arbitrary detention and the use of sexual and gender-based violence and torture in 

detention centres referred to in the reports of the Commission of Inquiry,  including, 

but not limited to, Branch 215, Branch 227, Branch 235, Branch 251, Air Force 

Intelligence Investigation Branch at Mezzeh military airport, and Sednaya prison, as 

well as military hospitals, including Tishreen and Harasta hospitals,  

 Recalling the statements made by the Secretary-General, the United Nations 

High Commissioner for Human Rights and the special procedures of the Human 

Rights Council that crimes against humanity and war crimes are likely to have been 

committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, noting the repeated encouragement by the 

High Commissioner for the Security Council to refer the situation to the 

International Criminal Court, and regretting that a draft resolution
23

 was not adopted 

notwithstanding broad support from Member States,  

 Expressing its deepest concern about the findings of the Commission of 

Inquiry and also the allegations contained in the evidence presented by “Caesar” in 

January 2014 regarding the torture and execution of persons incarcerated by the 

Syrian authorities, and underscoring the need for those allegations and similar 

evidence to be collected, examined and made available for future accountability 

efforts, 

 Expressing concern that the implementation of Security Council resolutions 

2139 (2014), 2165 (2014), 2191 (2014), 2254 (2015) of 18 December 2015, 2258 

(2015), 2268 (2016) and 2286 (2016) remains largely unfulfilled, and noting the 

urgent need to strengthen efforts to address the humanitarian situation in the Syrian 

Arab Republic, including through protection of civilians and rapid, unimpeded and 

sustained humanitarian access, 

 Recalling its commitment to Security Council resolutions 2170 (2014), 2178 

(2014) and 2253 (2015), 

 Alarmed that more than 4.8 million refugees, including more than 3.6 million 

women and children, have been forced to flee the Syrian Arab Republic and that 

13.5 million people in the Syrian Arab Republic, of whom 6.1 million are internally 

displaced, require urgent humanitarian assistance, which has resulted in an influx of 

Syrian refugees into neighbouring countries, other countries in the region and 

beyond, and alarmed at the risk the situation presents to regional and international 

stability, 

 Expressing its profound indignation at the death of many more than 15,000 

children and the many more injured since the beginning of the peaceful protests in 

March 2011, and at all grave violations and abuses committed against children in

contravention of applicable international law, such as their recruitment and use, 

killing and maiming, rape, kidnapping and abductions and attacks on schools and 

hospitals, as well as their arbitrary arrest, detention, torture, ill -treatment and their 

use as human shields, 

 Expressing its deep appreciation for the significant efforts that have been 

made by neighbouring countries and other countries in the region to accommodate 

Syrians, while acknowledging the increasing financial, socioeconomic and political 

impact of the presence of large-scale refugee and displaced populations in those 

countries, notably in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, Egypt and Libya,  

 Welcoming the hosting by the Government of Kuwait of the First, Second  

and Third International Humanitarian Pledging Conferences for Syria, held on  

30 January 2013, 15 January 2014 and 31 March 2015, and expressing its deep 

appreciation for the significant pledges of humanitarian assistance that have been 

made, also welcoming the initiative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 

Northern Ireland, Germany, Norway, Kuwait and the United Nations, which 

co-hosted the London conference on supporting the Syrian Arab Republic and the 

region on 4 February 2016, and renewing its call upon all members of the 

international community to respond expeditiously to the Syrian humanitarian 

appeals and to disburse all previous pledges,  

 Welcoming also the efforts of the United Nations and the League of Arab 

States and all diplomatic efforts to achieve a political solution to the Syrian crisis 

based on the final communiqué of the Action Group for Syria of 30 June 2012,
24

 and 

consistent with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), 

 Expressing full support for the efforts of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-

General for Syria, with a view to protection of the civilian population and the full 

implementation of the Syrian political process that establishes credible, inclusive 

and non-sectarian governance, in accordance with the final communiqué
24

 and 

consistent with Security Council resolutions 2254 (2015) and 2258 (2015), urging 

the Special Envoy to pave the way for the negotiation of a genuine political 

transition, demanding a restoration of the cessation of hostilities and that all parties 

to the cessation of hostilities in the Syrian Arab Republic respect their 

commitments, and urging all Member States, especially the members of the 

International Syria Support Group, to use their influence to ensure respect for those 

commitments and the full implementation of those resolutions, to support efforts to 

create conditions for a durable and lasting ceasefire, which is essential to achieving 

a political solution to the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, and to bring to an 

end the systematic, widespread and gross violations and abuses of human rights and 

violations of international humanitarian law,  

 1. Strongly condemns the recent escalation of attacks directed against 

civilians in Aleppo and other besieged and hard-to-reach areas, and demands that 

the humanitarian provisions of Security Council resolutions 2254 (2015), 2258 

(2015) and 2286 (2016) be immediately implemented and that humanitarian aid be

 2. Also strongly condemns all violations and abuses of international human 

rights law and all violations of international humanitarian law committed, in 

particular all indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks, including the use of barrel 

bombs in civilian areas and against civilian infrastructure, and demands that all 

parties immediately demilitarize medical facilities and schools and comply with 

their obligations under international law;  

 3. Deplores and condemns in the strongest terms  the continued armed 

violence by the Syrian authorities against its own people since the beginning of the 

peaceful protests in 2011, and demands that the Syrian authorities immediately put 

an end to all indiscriminate attacks, including those involving the use of terror 

tactics, air strikes, barrel and vacuum bombs, incendiary weapons, chemical 

weapons and heavy artillery; 

 4. Strongly condemns any use of any toxic chemicals, such as chlorine, by 

any party as a weapon in the Syrian Arab Republic;  

 5. Recalls the decision of the Security Council that the Syrian Arab 

Republic shall not use, develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile or retain 

chemical weapons, or transfer, directly or indirectly, chemical weapons to other 

States or non-State actors and, in keeping with the decision of the Council, 

expresses its strong conviction that those individuals responsible for the use of 

chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic should be held accountable, and 

calls for a significant enhancement of the verification measures of the Organization 

for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons;  

 6. Welcomes the reports of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical 

Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism of 24 August 2016
25

 and  

21 October 2016,
26

 and notes with deep concern its findings that the Syrian Arab 

Armed Forces were responsible for the use of chemical weapons in at least three 

attacks in the Syrian Arab Republic (Talmenes in 2014, Sarmin in 2015 and Qmenas 

in 2015) and that so-called ISIL-Da’esh was responsible for one mustard gas attack 

in the Syrian Arab Republic (Marea in 2015);  

 7. Demands that the Syrian regime and so-called ISIL-Da’esh immediately 

cease the use of chemical weapons, and also demands that the Syrian regime adhere 

fully to its international obligations, including the requirement that it declare in full 

its chemical weapons programme, with special emphasis on the need for the Syrian 

Arab Republic to urgently resolve the verified gaps, inconsistencies and 

discrepancies pertaining to its declaration in respect of the Convent ion on the 

Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical 

Weapons and on Their Destruction
22

 and to eliminate its chemical weapons 

programme in its entirety as referred to in the report of the Director General of the 

Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, dated 22 February 2016)
27

and related submissions of the Syrian Arab Republic are accurate and complete, as 

required by the Convention and decision EC-M-33/DEC.1 of the Executive Council 

of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons;
