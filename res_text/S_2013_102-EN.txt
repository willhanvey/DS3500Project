  Morocco, Rwanda, Togo and United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland: draft resolution  
 
 

 The Security Council,  

 Recalling its previous resolutions, statements of its President and press 
statements on the situation in Guinea-Bissau, in particular resolutions 2030 (2011) 
and 2048 (2012),  

 Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on Guinea-Bissau, dated 
11 January 2013 (S/2013/26) and the recommendations contained therein, and 
welcoming the activities undertaken by the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding 
Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS), despite the political and security challenges 
in the field,  

 Remaining seriously concerned about the situation in Guinea-Bissau since the 
military coup of 12 April 2012, that undermined the conclusion of the democratic 
electoral process in Guinea-Bissau,  

 Stressing that the consolidation of peace and stability in Guinea-Bissau can 
only result from a consensual, inclusive and nationally owned transition process, the 
restoration and respect for constitutional order, the reforms in the defence, security 
and justice sectors, the promotion of the rule of law, the protection of human rights, 
the promotion of socioeconomic development and the fight against impunity and 
drug trafficking,  

 Taking note of the recent positive political developments in Guinea-Bissau and 
of the intention of key stakeholders to revise the transitional political pact including 
setting technically feasible deadlines for the holding of free, fair and transparent 
presidential and legislative elections in line with national legislation and relevant 
international standards,  

 Deploring the continued lack of effective civilian control and oversight over 
the defence and security forces, which hampers the political process and effective 
functioning of State institutions,  

 Stressing the importance of security sector reform (SSR) as a crucial element 
for long-term stability in Guinea-Bissau, welcoming the efforts of ECOWAS to 
support the SSR process in Guinea-Bissau and in this regard, taking note of the 
signing on 7 November 2012 of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for 
implementation of the SSR road map, while reiterating the need for coordinated 
action by all relevant regional and international partners of Guinea-Bissau in this 
field,  



S/2013/102  
 

13-24103 2 
 

 Expressing serious concern by reports of continuing serious violations of 
human rights, including political and civil rights, as well as the atmosphere of 
tension in Guinea-Bissau,  

 Reiterating its deep concern at the reported increasing in drug trafficking in 
Guinea-Bissau since the military coup of 12 April 2012 and urging both the civilian 
and military leadership in Guinea-Bissau and international partners to demonstrate 
greater commitment to combat drug trafficking,  

 Reiterating the importance of the continued support of the United Nations and 
regional and bilateral partners for the long-term security and development of 
Guinea-Bissau, particularly towards the restoration of constitutional order, the 
implementation of security and justice sectors reforms, the fight against drug 
trafficking, organized crime and human trafficking as well as the creation of 
enabling environment for good governance and inclusive social and economic 
development,  

 Reaffirming the need for active and close coordination of all partners of 
Guinea-Bissau to address existing political, security and development challenges 
and welcoming in this regard, the joint mission of the African Union (AU), 
ECOWAS, Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP), the European 
Union (EU) and the United Nations which took place in Bissau from 16 to 
21 December 2012, in order to assess the political and security situation in the 
country, and to formulate recommendations,  

 Stressing that the complex situation facing Guinea-Bissau has undermined the 
smooth implementation of the mandate conferred by the Council to the United 
Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS), pursuant to 
resolution 2030 (2011), as well as activities of the Peacebuilding Commission and 
considering in this regard, the need expressed by the Secretary-General to realign 
the United Nations system’s activities in the areas of state-building and 
peacebuilding,  

 Welcoming the appointment of Mr. José Ramos Horta as the new Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General in Guinea-Bissau and reiterating its 
gratitude for the work of the previous Special Representative of the Secretary-
General Joseph Mutaboba for the past four years,  

 Reaffirming its full commitment to the consolidation of peace and stability in 
Guinea-Bissau:  

 1. Decides to extend the current mandate of UNIOGBIS until 31 May 2013;  

 2. Requests the Secretary-General to report at the latest by 30 April 2013 to 
provide an assessment of the situation in Guinea-Bissau and to make 
recommendations with respect to the Mission’s mandate and a possible readjustment 
of the support of the United Nations, taking into account the scope of the 
challenges, and the recommendations of the joint international mission (AU, 
ECOWAS, CPLP, EU and United Nations);  

 3. Requests the Secretary-General to continue to work through UNIOGBIS, 
in coordination with other partners, including ECOWAS and CPLP, on the ongoing 
dialogue process among political parties, to facilitate the early finalization of a 
broader political agreement for the restoration of constitutional order and the 
holding of free, fair and transparent elections;  



 S/2013/102
 

3 13-24103 
 

 4. Calls upon Guinea-Bissau stakeholders to continue their efforts to 
deepen the internal political dialogue in order to create an environment conducive to 
the holding of free, fair and transparent elections, acceptable to all, for a rapid 
return to constitutional order and the long-term stabilization of Guinea-Bissau;  

 5.  Reiterates its demand to the armed forces to submit themselves fully to 
civilian control;  

 6.  Condemns the violations of human rights, including political and civil 
rights and urges the Guinea-Bissau authorities to take all necessary measures to 
protect human rights and put an end to impunity and to initiate investigations to 
identify the perpetrators of such acts and bring them to justice;  

 7.  Expresses its willingness to consider further action, based on additional 
information, against those involved in drug trafficking and organized crime in 
Guinea-Bissau in line of paragraphs 6 and 7 of its resolution 2048 (2012);  

 8.  Urges civilian and military officials in Guinea-Bissau to demonstrate 
greater commitment to effectively combat drug trafficking including by ensuring the 
proper functioning of state agencies responsible for border control and the fight 
against drug trafficking, and encourages them to further support the efforts of the 
international community to that end;  

 9.  Reaffirms the importance of coordination between the main partners of 
Guinea-Bissau having shared goals and speaking with one voice;
