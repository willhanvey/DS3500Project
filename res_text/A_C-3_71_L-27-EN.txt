welcoming the increasing number of accessions to and ratifications of the Second 

Optional Protocol,  

 Reaffirming its resolutions 62/149 of 18 December 2007, 63/168 of 

18 December 2008, 65/206 of 21 December 2010, 67/176 of 20 December 2012 and 

69/186 of 18 December 2014 on the question of a moratorium on the use of the 

death penalty, in which the General Assembly called upon States that still maintain 

the death penalty to establish a moratorium on executions with a view to aboli shing it,  

 Welcoming all relevant decisions and resolutions of the Human Rights 

Council,  

 Mindful that any miscarriage or failure of justice in the implementation of the 

death penalty is irreversible and irreparable,  

 Convinced that a moratorium on the use of the death penalty contributes to 

respect for human dignity and to the enhancement and progressive development of 

human rights, and considering that there is no conclusive evidence of the deterrent 

value of the death penalty,  

 Noting ongoing local and national debates and regional initiatives on the death 

penalty, as well as the readiness of an increasing number of Member States to make 

available to the public information on the use of the death penalty, and also, in this 

regard, the decision by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 26/2 of 26 June 

2014
5
 to convene biennial high-level panel discussions in order to further exchange 

views on the question of the death penalty,  

 Recognizing the role of national human rights institutions in contribut ing to 

ongoing local and national debates and regional initiatives on the death penalty,   

 Welcoming the considerable movement towards the abolition of the death 

penalty globally and the fact that many States are applying a moratorium, including 

long-standing moratoriums, either in law or in practice, on the use of the death 

penalty,  

 Emphasizing the need to ensure that persons facing the death penalty are 

treated with humanity and with respect for their inherent dignity and in compliance 

with their rights under international human rights law,  

 Noting the technical cooperation among Member States, as well as the role of 

relevant United Nations entities and human rights mechanisms, in supporting State 

efforts to establish moratoriums on the death penalty,   

 Bearing in mind the work of special procedures mandate holders who have 

addressed human rights issues related to the death penalty within the framework of 

their respective mandates,  

 1. Expresses its deep concern about the continued application of the death 

penalty;
