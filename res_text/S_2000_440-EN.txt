Deeply disturbed by the continuation of fighting between Eritrea and Ethiopia,

Deploring the loss of human life resulting from the fighting, and strongly

independence and territorial integrity of Eritrea and Ethiopia,

Expressing its strong support for the efforts of the Organization of African

Noting that the proximity talks held in Algiers from 29 April to 5 May 2000
and reported in the OAU Communiqué of 5 May 2000 (S/2000/394) were intended
to assist the two parties to arrive at a final detailed peace implementation plan
acceptable to each of them, which would lead to the peaceful resolution of the
conflict,

Recalling the efforts of the Security Council, including through its Mission to
the region, to achieve a peaceful resolution of the situation,

Convinced of the need for further and immediate diplomatic efforts,

Noting with concern that the fighting has serious humanitarian implications for
the civilian population of the two States,
