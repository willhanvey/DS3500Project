deep concern at the loss of civilian life from Al Shabaab attacks, further expressing 

concern over the presence in Somalia of pro-Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant 

actors, noting the threat posed by Al Shabaab is evolving and that degrading 

Al Shabaab and building and sustaining peace will require regional cohesion, a 

comprehensive strategy, reconfiguration of support, a focus on stabilisation, enhanced 

efforts across multiple avenues and an integrated and coherent approach among 

relevant actors,  

 Underlining its commitment to further strengthen Somalia’s security institutions 

and forces towards exercising full authority over its own territory and taking the lead 

in security operations,  

 Paying tribute to the bravery and sacrifices made by the African Union Mission 

in Somalia (AMISOM) and Somali security forces personnel in the fight against 

Al Shabaab, and commending the contribution of AMISOM to building lasting peace 

and stability in Somalia,  

 Welcoming the progress made over the last year including recovering additional 

territory from Al Shabaab, training Somali security and police forces, steps to deepen 

Somali security sector reform such as completion of biometric registration of Somali

the Somali-led Transition Plan which sets out the progressive transfer of security 

responsibilities from AMISOM to the Somali security institutions and forces, through 

operational, supporting and institutional-building activities, and underlines its 

expectation that the Somali authorities set out their clear vision for security post -2021

violations of international humanitarian law in Somalia, calling on all parties to act 

in full compliance with their obligations under international human rights law and

disaster management and relief efforts and their efforts to create conditions conducive 

to the delivery of humanitarian assistance,

conflicts and in peace-building, and stressing the importance of their full, effective 

and meaningful participation and involvement in all efforts at all levels for the 

maintenance and promotion of peace and security, and the need to increase their role

 Emphasising the need for adequate risk assessment and risk management
