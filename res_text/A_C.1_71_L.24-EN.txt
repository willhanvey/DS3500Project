  Humanitarian pledge for the prohibition and elimination of 

nuclear weapons  
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 70/48 of 7 December 2015,    

 Ever mindful of the unacceptable harm that victims of nuclear weapon 

explosions and nuclear testing have experienced, and recognizing that the rights and 

needs of victims have not yet been adequately addressed,  

 Understanding that the immediate, medium-term and long-term consequences 

of a nuclear weapon explosion would be significantly graver than was understood in 

the past and would not be constrained by national borders but have regional or even 

global effects, potentially threatening the survival of humanity,  

 Recognizing the complexity of and relationship between these consequences 

for, inter alia, health, the environment, infrastructure, food security, climate, 

development, social cohesion, displacement and the global economy, which would 

be systemic and potentially irreversible, 

 Aware that the risk of a nuclear weapon explosion is significantly greater than 

previously assumed and is indeed increasing with increased proliferation, the 

lowering of the technical threshold for nuclear weapon capability, the ongoing 

modernization of nuclear weapon arsenals in States possessing nuclear weapons and 

the role that is attributed to nuclear weapons in the nuclear doctrines of such States,

16-17879 2/3 

 

 Cognizant that the risk of the use of nuclear weapons, with its unacceptable 

consequences, can be avoided only when all nuclear weapons have been eliminated,  

 Emphasizing that the consequences of a nuclear weapon explosion and the 

risks associated with nuclear weapons concern the security of all humanity and that 

all States share the responsibility to prevent any use of nuclear weapons,  

 Emphasizing also that the scope of the consequences of a nuclear weapon 

explosion and the associated risks raise profound moral and ethical questions that go 

beyond debates about the legality of nuclear weapons, 

 Mindful that no national or international capacity exists that would adequately 

respond to the human suffering and humanitarian harm that would result from a 

nuclear weapon explosion in a populated area, and that such capacity most likely 

will never exist, 

 Affirming that it is in the interest of the very survival of humanity that nuclear 

weapons are never used again, under any circumstances,  

 Reiterating the crucial role that international organizations, relevant entities of 

the United Nations, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, 

elected representatives, academia and civil society play in advancing the shared 

objective of a nuclear-weapon-free world, 

 Recalling the three international conferences convened, respectively, by 

Norway in March 2013, Mexico in February 2014 and Austria in December 2014 on 

the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons, and the compelling evidence presented 

at these conferences, 

 Welcoming the fact that 127 States have drawn inescapable conclusions from 

the evidence on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons and, consequently, 

supported or endorsed the Humanitarian Pledge,
1
 

 1. Stresses the importance of having fact-based discussions and presenting 

findings and compelling evidence on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons in 

all relevant forums and within the United Nations framework, as they should be at 

the centre of all deliberations and the implementation of obligations and 

commitments with regard to nuclear disarmament;  

 2. Appeals to all States to follow the imperative of human security for all 

and to promote the protection of civilians against risks stemming from nuclear 

weapons; 

 3. Urges all States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 

Weapons
2
 to renew their commitment to the urgent and full implementation of their 

existing obligations under article VI, and calls upon all States to identify and pursue 

effective measures to fill the legal gap for the prohibition and elimination of nuclear 

weapons and to cooperate with all stakeholders to achieve this goal; 

 4. Calls upon all States to pursue an additional legal instrument or 

instruments with urgency and to support international efforts to prohibit and 

eliminate nuclear weapons;

 5. Recalls that all such efforts are aimed at contributing to the full 

implementation of article VI of the Treaty on the Non -Proliferation of Nuclear 

Weapons and the achievement and maintenance of a world without nuclear 

weapons; 

 6. Requests all States possessing nuclear weapons, pending the total 

elimination of their nuclear weapon arsenals, to take concrete interim measures to 

reduce the risk of nuclear weapon detonations, including by reducing the 

operational status of nuclear weapons and moving nuclear weapons away from 

deployment and into storage, diminishing the role of nuclear weapons in military 

doctrines and rapidly reducing all types of nuclear weapons;  

 7. Calls upon all relevant stakeholders, States, international organizations, 

the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, parliamentarians and civil 

society to cooperate in efforts to stigmatize, prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons 

in the light of their unacceptable humanitarian consequences and associated risks; 

 8. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-second 

session, under the item entitled “General and complete disarmament”, the sub -item 

entitled “Humanitarian pledge for the prohibition and elimination of nuclear 

weapons”.
