vulnerabilities of girls and boys should be duly considered when planning and 

carrying out actions concerning children in situations of armed conflict,  

 Stressing the importance of giving due consideration to child protection issues 

from the early stages of all peace processes, in particular the integration of child

and urges all parties to armed conflict to refrain from actions that impede children ’s 

access to education and to health services;

having committed crimes during armed conflicts should be treated primarily as 

victims of violations of international law, and urges Member States to comply with 



S/2018/667 
 

 

18-11344 6/8

and for the shortest appropriate period of time, as well as to avoid wherever possible 

the use of pretrial detention for children, and calls on Member States to apply  due 

process for all children detained for association with armed forces and armed groups;

integration of child protection issues in peace processes and underlines the 

importance of engaging armed forces and armed groups on child protection concerns 

during peace processes and in the peacebuilding process and calls upon Member 

States, United Nations entities, the Peacebuilding Commission, and other parties 

concerned to integrate child protection provisions, including those relating to the 

release and reintegration of children formerly associated with armed forces or armed 

groups, as well as provisions on the rights and well-being of children, into all peace 

negotiations, ceasefire and peace agreements, and in provisions for ceasefire 

monitoring, and taking into account children’s views, where possible, in these 

processes;  

 23.  Calls upon Member States, United Nations entities, including the 

Peacebuilding Commission and other parties concerned to ensure that the views of 

children are taken into account in programming activities throughout the conflict 

cycle, and to ensure that the protection, rights, well-being and empowerment of 

children affected by armed conflict are fully incorporated and prioritized in all post-

 25.  Urges concerned Member States, when undertaking security sector 

reforms, to mainstream child protection and ensure that the specific needs of girls and 

boys are fully taken into account, such as the inclusion of child protection in military 

training and standard operating procedures, including on the handover of children to 

relevant civilian child protection actors, the establishment of child protection units in 

national security forces, and the strengthening of effective age assessment 

mechanisms to prevent underage recruitment, while stressing in the latter regard the 

importance of ensuring universal birth registration, including late birth registration 

which should remain an exception;  

 26.  Encourages Member States to focus on long-term and sustainable 

reintegration and rehabilitation opportunities for children affected by armed conflict 

that are gender- and age-sensitive, including access to health care, psychosocial 

support, and education programmes, as well as raising awareness and working with 

communities to avoid stigmatization of these children and facilitate their return, while 

taking into account the specific needs of girls and boys, to contribute to the well -

being of children and to sustainable peace and security;  

 27.  Stresses the importance of long-term and sustainable funding for mental

that have not yet done so to ratify this instrument;  

 30.  Stressing the importance of accountability for all violations and abuses 

against children in armed conflict and calls on all States to continue to address 

impunity by efforts to strengthen national accountability mechanisms, including 

building investigative and prosecutorial capacities, ensuring that those responsible 

for violations and abuses against children are brought to justice and held accountable 

without undue delay, including through timely and systematic investigation and 

prosecution, the results of which are made public, and ensure that all victims have 

access to justice as well as to the medical and support services that they need;  

 31.  Emphasizes the responsibility of all States to put an end to impunity and 

to investigate and prosecute those responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, 

war crimes and other egregious crimes perpetrated against children and highlights in 

this regard the contribution of the International Criminal Court, in matters that are 

within its jurisdiction, and in accordance with the principle of complementarity to 

national criminal jurisdictions as set out in the Rome Statute;  

 32.  Reiterates the Security Council’s readiness to adopt targeted and 

graduated measures against persistent perpetrators of violations and abuses

to continue the inclusion of specific provisions for the protection of children in the 

mandates of all relevant United Nations peacekeeping operations and political 

missions, encourages deployment of child protection advisers to such missions, and 

calls upon the Secretary-General to ensure that the need for and the number and roles 

of such advisers are systematically assessed during the preparation and renewal of 

each United Nations peacekeeping operation and political mission, and that t hey are 

speedily recruited, expeditiously deployed, and properly resourced where appointed,
