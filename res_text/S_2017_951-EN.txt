recognizing cooperation between Sudan and South Sudan on refugees, humanitarian 

corridors, and trade,  

 Urging the Governments of Sudan and South Sudan to reinvigorate progress 

towards implementing the Temporary Arrangements for the Administration and 

Security of the Abyei Area as set out in the 20 June 2011 Agreement,  

 Expressing its full support for the efforts of the African Union on the situation 

between the Republic of Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan, in order to ease 

the current tension, facilitate the resumption of negotiations on post -secession 

relations and the normalization of their relations, and stressing the importance of the 

African Union’s continued engagement,  

 Reaffirming its previous resolutions 1265 (1999), 1296 (2000), 1674 (2006), 

1738 (2006), 1894 (2009) 2175 (2014) and 2222 (2015) on the protection of

 Stressing the need for effective human rights monitoring and reporting, 

including of any sexual and gender-based violence and violations and abuses 

committed against women and children, taking note that there have been no 

developments with regard to the operationalization of human rights monitoring in 

the Abyei Area, and reiterating its concern at the lack of cooperation by the parties 

with the Secretary-General to this end,  

 Recalling that its resolution 2086 (2013) reiterates the importance, when 

establishing and renewing the mandates of United Nations Missions, of including 

provisions on the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women in 

post-conflict situations and on children and armed conflict, and emphasizing that 

persistent barriers to full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), and subsequent 

resolutions on women, peace, and security, including 2242 (2015), will only be 

dismantled through dedicated commitment to women’s empowerment, participation, 

and human rights, and through concerted leadership, consistent information and 

action, and support, to build women’s engagement in all levels of decision -making,  

 Acknowledging the Government of Sudan and the Government of South 

Sudan’s acceptance at the 13–14 October 2015 JPSM meeting of the map presented

(SDBZ), their agreement that the centreline is only the location of the separation 

line between armed forces, as well as the parties’ agreement to activate all 

mechanisms relating to the JPSM as provided for in relevant agreements, and 

encouraging the parties to delineate or agree on the coordinates of, and demilitarize 

the SDBZ, including the “14 Mile Area”, and to fully implement the Joint Border 

Verification and Monitoring Mechanism (JBVMM), in accordance with Security 

Council resolution 2046 (2012) and the AUPSC Roadmap of 24 April 2012, and 

underlining the importance of fully establishing and maintaining effective JBVMM 

monitoring of the SDBZ, including the “14 Mile Area”, and further urging the 

parties to cooperate in allowing the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei 

(UNISFA) to fulfil its responsibility to provide security for the JBVMM’s mission 

to monitor the SDBZ,  

 Recalling its decision in resolution 2352 (2017) to end the mandate for support 

to the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism (JBVMM) unless both 

parties demonstrate through their actions clear commitment and steadfast guarantees 

for the implementation of the JBVMM, in line with steps outlined in paragraph 7 of

3/8 17-20315 

 

resolution 2352 (2017), including resuming border demarcation discussions, holding 

regular meetings of the JPSM, and granting UNISFA full freedom of movement,  

 Recognizing some progress by the parties since May 2017 but regretting the 

lack of significant concrete progress made by both parties on achieving the 

benchmarks for the JBVMM and the unnecessary impediments imposed upon the 

JBVMM, reducing its ability to effectively monitor the SDBZ,  

 Noting with concern the absence of local institutions to manage the Abyei Area 

and encouraging continued progress in convening Abyei Joint Oversight Committee 

(AJOC) meetings,  

 Recognizing the importance of regular dialogue between the Governments of 

Sudan and South Sudan, recalling the United Nations Security Council decision in 

resolution 2046 (2012) that the parties must resume immediately negotiations to 

reach agreement on Abyei’s final status under the auspices of the AUHIP, calling 

upon all parties to engage constructively in the process mediated by the AUHIP 

towards final agreement on the final status of the Abyei Area, and stressing that the 

parties must immediately implement pending aspects of the 20 June 2011 

Agreement, in particular to resolve the dispute over the Abyei Area Agreement, and 

to resolve the dispute over the Abyei Area Council, and immediately establish the 

Abyei Area Administration and Abyei Police Service,  

 Stressing that both countries and communities will have much to gain if they 

show restraint and choose the path of dialogue instead of resorting to violence or 

provocations,  

 Commending the continued assistance provided to the parties by the AUHIP, 

the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the Federal Democratic Republic 

of Ethiopia, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Sudan and South Sudan, 

and UNISFA,  

 Further commending the efforts of UNISFA in effectively carrying out its 

mandate, including by its ongoing facilitation of peaceful migration throughout the 

Abyei Area, conflict prevention, mediation and deterrence, and expressing its deep 

appreciation for the work of the troop-contributing countries, and strongly 

underscoring the unacceptability of any attack on United Nations personnel, 

including the firing on UNISFA patrols in early 2017 by unknown assailants, and 

reiterating that such attacks should be swiftly and thoroughly investigated, and that 

those responsible should be held to account,  

 Taking note of the security situation in the Abyei Area as characterized by the 

17 October 2017 Secretary-General’s report (S/2017/870), and acknowledging 

UNISFA’s contribution to enhanced peace and stability since its deployment and 

expressing its determination to prevent the recurrence of violence against or 

displacements of civilians and to avert intercommunal conflict,  

 Reiterating its deep concern regarding the public administration and rule of 

law vacuum in the Abyei Area, due to continued delays in the establishment of the 

Abyei Area Administration and Council and Police, including a special unit to deal 

with particular issues related to nomadic migration, which are essential to maintain 

law and order and prevent intercommunal conflict in Abyei, and in this regard, 

welcoming UNISFA’s efforts to support and strengthen community protection 

committees, and to continue engaging with both governments on this issue,  

 Noting with concern the continued delay in establishing the temporary 

institutions and resolving the final status of Abyei and that the continued threat of 

intercommunal violence contributes to heightened tensions in the Abye i Area,

S/2017/951 
 

 

17-20315 4/8 

 

including those ongoing tensions that prevent UNISFA’s and other agencies’ 

Sudanese staff from returning to Abyei,  

 Urging all parties to refrain from any unilateral action that could aggravate 

intercommunal relations within the Abyei Area, expressing concern over the 

continued implications of what the AUPSC described in their 6 November 2013 

press statement as “the decision by the Ngok Dinka to conduct a unilateral 

referendum” and also in this context, taking note that the Government of Sudan 

proceeded with its April 2015 national elections in Abyei,  

 Bearing in mind the current humanitarian situation in which humanitarian 

actors continue to provide assistance to 100,000 people in the Abyei Area and the 

importance of coherence of United Nations assistance in the region, and further 

stressing the urgency of facilitating the delivery of humanitarian assistance to all 

affected populations,  

 Affirming the importance of voluntary, safe, dignified return and sustainable 

reintegration of displaced persons, and of peaceful and orderly migration cycles 

respecting the traditional migratory routes from Sudan to South Sudan through 

Abyei, and urging UNISFA to continue to take measures as necessary to ensure 

security in the Abyei Area in accordance with its mandate,  

 Recalling its resolution 2117 (2013), and expressing grave concern at the 

threat to peace and security in Abyei arising from the illicit transfer, destabilizing 

accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons, welcoming the 

completion of infrastructure, systems, and policy for weapons confiscation, storage 

and destruction, and calling on UNISFA to ensure adequate protection of this 

infrastructure,  

 Expressing concern about the residual threat of landmines and explosive 

remnants of war in the Abyei Area, which hinders the safe return of displaced 

persons to their homes, safe migration, and livelihood activities,  

 Taking note of the 28 July 2017 and 17 October 2017 Secretary-General’s 

reports (S/2017/649 and S/2017/870), including the Secretary-General’s call on the 

parties to consolidate the gains achieved by UNISFA at the local level by actively 

engaging in efforts to establish the Abyei Area Administration and Council, and to 

constitute the Abyei Area Police,  

 Recalling that the Security Council welcomed in resolution 2205 (2015) the 

decision of the Secretary-General to appoint a civilian head of mission,  

 Recognizing that the current situation in Abyei and along the border between 

the Sudan and South Sudan continues to constitute a serious threat to international 

peace and security,  

 1. Decides to extend until 15 May 2018 the mandate of the United Nations

specific measures described in paragraph 9;  

 3. Decides to maintain the authorized troop ceiling of 4,791 until 15 April 

2018, and further decides that as of 15 April 2018, the authorized troop ceiling shall

stability and the future relations between them;  

 5. Further reiterates its demand that Sudan and South Sudan urgently 

commence the establishment of the Abyei Area Administration and Council, 

including by resolving the deadlock over the composition of the Council, and

engagement, and requests the Secretary-General to provide an assessment of 

progress on these issues in his regular reports;  

 8. Expresses serious concern regarding the delays to fully operationalize the 

JBVMM, recalls the Secretary-General’s benchmarks and recommendations 

regarding JBVMM operations, takes note that continued investment in achieving 

full operational capability of the JBVMM should be based on a set of conditions, 

including resolution of the dispute over the SDBZ, and calls upon the Government 

of Sudan and the Government of South Sudan to make timely and effective use of 

the JBVMM, JPSM and other agreed joint mechanisms to ensure the security and 

transparency of the SDBZ, including the “14 Mile Area”;  

 9. Determines to consider renewing UNISFA’s mandate to support the 

JBVMM should both parties adhere to the specific measures agreed to in the May

17-20315 6/8 

 

current or future legal status of the border, ongoing negotiations on the disputed and 

claimed areas, and demarcation of the borders;  

 11. Underscores that UNISFA’s protection of civilians mandate as set out in

protect civilians under imminent threat of physical violence, irrespective of the 

source of such violence, and commending UNISFA’s efforts in that regard;  

 12. Condemns the intermittent presence of South Sudan security service

violation of the 20 June 2011 Agreement, as well as any entry of armed militias into 

the territory, and reiterates its demands that immediately and without preconditions 

the Government of South Sudan fully redeploy its security service personnel from 

the Abyei Area and that the Government of Sudan redeploy the Oil P olice in Diffra 

from the Abyei Area, and further reiterates, in accordance with relevant resolutions, 

in particular resolution 1990 (2011) and resolution 2046 (2012), that the Abyei Area 

shall be demilitarized from any forces, as well as armed elements of the local

 13. Supports the AJOC’s 3 May 2013 and 30 March 2015 decisions on 

Abyei’s status as a weapons-free area, underscores the AUPSC’s concern in its 

7 May 2013 Communiqué over reports that various communities living in Abyei are 

heavily armed, recalls that the 20 June 2011 Agreement on Temporary 

Arrangements for the Administration and Security of the Abyei Area stipulates that 

Abyei should be a weapons-free area and that only UNISFA is authorized to carry 

weapons inside the area, and in this regard, urges the two Governments to take all 

necessary steps to ensure that Abyei is effectively demilitarized, including through 

disarmament programs as necessary;  

 14. Reaffirms that UNISFA may undertake weapons confiscation and 

destruction in the Abyei Area as authorized under resolution 1990 (2011), consistent 

with its mandate and within its existing capabilities, in coordination with the 

signatories of the June 2011 Agreement on the Temporary Arrangements for the 

Administration and Security of the Abyei Area, the AJOC, and the Misseriya and 

Ngok Dinka communities and consistent with the previous AJOC decision to 

establish the Area as a “weapons free area”, and reiterates its request that UNISFA, 

observe, document and report on the movement of weapons into Abyei and the 

presence, destruction and confiscation of weapons within Abyei as part of the 

Secretary-General’s regular reporting cycle;  

 15. Requests UNISFA to continue its dialogue with the AJOC and with the 

Misseriya and Ngok Dinka communities on effective strategies and oversight 

mechanisms for ensuring full compliance by all relevant parties with Abyei’s status 

as a weapons-free area, with a particular priority placed on the urgent elimination of 

heavy or crew-served weapons, as well as rocket-propelled grenades, and calls upon 

the Governments of Sudan and South Sudan, the AJOC, and the Misseriya and Ngok 

Dinka communities to extend full cooperation to UNISFA in this regard;  

 16. Urges the two Governments immediately to take steps to implement 

confidence-building measures among the respective communities in the Abyei Area, 

ensuring women are involved at all stages, including through reconciliation 

processes at the grass-roots level as well as through support for the ongoing efforts 

of non-governmental organizations engaging in peacebuilding, and by fully 

supporting UNISFA’s efforts in promoting community dialogue, strongly welcomes 

continued engagement between the Ngok Dinka and Misseriya communities, and 

strongly urges all Abyei communities to exercise maximum restraint in all their 

engagements and to desist from inflammatory acts or statements that may lead to 

violent clashes;
