 Reiterating its vision of a region where two democratic States, Israel and 

Palestine, live side by side in peace within secure and recognized borders,  

 Stressing that the status quo is not sustainable and that significant steps, 

consistent with the transition contemplated by prior agreements, are urgently needed 

in order to (i) stabilize the situation and to reverse negative trends on the ground, 

which are steadily eroding the two-State solution and entrenching a one-State 

reality, and (ii) to create the conditions for successful final status negotiations and 

for advancing the two-State solution through those negotiations and on the ground,  

 1. Reaffirms that the establishment by Israel of settlements in the 

Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, has no legal 

validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major 

obstacle to the achievement of the two-State solution and a just, lasting and 

comprehensive peace; 

 2. Reiterates its demand that Israel immediately and completely cease all 

settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, 

and that it fully respect all of its legal obligations in this regard;  

 3. Underlines that it will not recognize any changes to the 4 June 1967 

lines, including with regard to Jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties 

through negotiations; 

 4. Stresses that the cessation of all Israeli settlement activities is essential 

for salvaging the two-State solution, and calls for affirmative steps to be taken 

immediately to reverse the negative trends on the ground that are imperilling the 

two-State solution; 

 5. Calls upon all States, bearing in mind paragraph 1 of this resolution, to 

distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the State of Israel and 

the territories occupied since 1967;  

 6. Calls for immediate steps to prevent all acts of violence against civilians, 

including acts of terror, as well as all acts of provocation and destruction, calls for 

accountability in this regard, and calls for compliance with obligations under 

international law for the strengthening of ongoing efforts to combat terrorism, 

including through existing security coordination, and to clearly condemn all acts of 

terrorism;  

 7. Calls upon both parties to act on the basis of international law, including 

international humanitarian law, and their previous agreements and obligations, to 

observe calm and restraint, and to refrain from provocative actions, incitement and 

inflammatory rhetoric, with the aim, inter alia, of de-escalating the situation on the 

ground, rebuilding trust and confidence, demonstrating through policies and actions 

a genuine commitment to the two-State solution, and creating the conditions 

necessary for promoting peace; 

 8. Calls upon all parties to continue, in the interest of the promotion of 

peace and security, to exert collective efforts to launch credible negotiations on all 

final status issues in the Middle East peace process and within the time frame 

specified by the Quartet in its statement of 21 September 2010;  



 
S/2016/1100 

 

3/3 16-22921 

 

 9. Urges in this regard the intensification and acceleration of international 

and regional diplomatic efforts and support aimed at achieving, without delay a  

comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East on the basis of the relevant 

United Nations resolutions, the Madrid terms of reference, including the principle of 

land for peace, the Arab Peace Initiative and the Quartet Roadmap and an end to the  

Israeli occupation that began in 1967; and underscores in this regard the importance 

of the ongoing efforts to advance the Arab Peace Initiative, the initiative of France 

for the convening of an international peace conference, the recent efforts of the 

Quartet, as well as the efforts of Egypt and the Russian Federation;  

 10. Confirms its determination to support the parties throughout the 

negotiations and in the implementation of an agreement;  

 11. Reaffirms its determination to examine practical ways and means to 

secure the full implementation of its relevant resolutions;  

 12. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Council every three 

months on the implementation of the provisions of the present resolution;  

 13. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
