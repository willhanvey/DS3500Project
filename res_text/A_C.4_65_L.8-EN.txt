agreements,  

 1. Notes with regret that repatriation or compensation of the refugees, as 
provided for in paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), has not yet

be a matter of grave concern and the Palestine refugees continue to require 
assistance to meet basic health, education and living needs;

for Palestine has been unable to find a means of achieving progress in the 
implementation of paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), and

towards the implementation of that paragraph and to report to the Assembly on the 
efforts being exerted in this regard as appropriate, but no later than 1 September 
2011;

region, pending the just resolution of the question of the Palestine refugees;  

 4. Calls upon all donors to continue to make the most generous efforts 
possible to meet the anticipated needs of the United Nations Relief and Works 
Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, including with regard to increased

the region, particularly in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and those mentioned 
in recent emergency appeals;
