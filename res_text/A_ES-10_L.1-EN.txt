The General Assembly,

Aware of the commencement, after the adoption of General Assembly
resolution 51/223 of 13 March 1997, of construction by Israel, the occupying
Power, of a new settlement in Jabal Abu Ghneim to the south of East Jerusalem on
18 March 1997, and of other illegal Israeli actions in Jerusalem and the rest of
the Occupied Palestinian Territory,

Noting with regret that the Security Council, at its 3747th meeting, on
7 March 1997, and at its 3756th meeting, on 21 March 1997, twice failed to adopt
a resolution on the actions referred to above, as a result of the negative vote
of a permanent member of the Council,

 Reaffirming the permanent responsibility of the United Nations with regard
to the question of Palestine until it is solved in all its aspects,

Reaffirming also the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of
territory by force,

Having considered the serious deterioration of the situation in the
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including Jerusalem, and in the Middle East in
general, including the serious difficulties facing the Middle East peace
process, as a result of recent Israeli actions and measures,

Affirming its support for the Middle East peace process, started at Madrid
in 1991, on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) of
22 November 1967, 338 (1973) of 22 October 1973 and 425 (1978) of 19 March 1978,
for the principle of land for peace and for the full and timely implementation
of the agreements reached between the Government of Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization, the representative of the Palestinian people, and of
all commitments reached between the parties,

Recalling its relevant resolutions, including resolutions 181 (II) of
29 November 1947 and 51/223, and the relevant resolutions of the Security
Council, in particular those on Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the
occupied territories, including resolutions 252 (1968) of 21 May 1968,
446 (1979) of 22 March 1979, 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979, 465 (1980) of
1 March 1980, 476 (1980) of 30 June 1980, 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980,
672 (1990) of 12 October 1990 and 1073 (1996) of 28 September 1996,

Reaffirming that the international community, through the United Nations,
has a legitimate interest in the question of the City of Jerusalem and the
protection of the unique spiritual and religious dimension of the City, as
foreseen in relevant United Nations resolutions on this matter,

Reaffirming also the applicability of the Geneva Convention relative to the
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and the
Regulations annexed to the Hague Convention IV of 1907 to the Occupied
Palestinian Territory, including Jerusalem, and all other Arab territories
occupied by Israel since 1967,

Recalling the obligation of the high contracting parties to the Geneva
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War to
respect and ensure respect for the Convention in all circumstances, in
accordance with article 1 of the Convention,

Conscious of the serious dangers arising from persistent violation and
grave breaches of the Convention and the responsibilities arising therefrom, 

Convinced that ensuring respect for treaties and other sources of
international law is essential for the maintenance of international peace and
security, and determined, in accordance with the preamble to the Charter of the
United Nations, to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the
obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be
maintained,

Also convinced, in this context, that the repeated violation by Israel, the
occupying Power, of international law and its failure to comply with relevant
Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and the agreements reached
between the parties undermine the Middle East peace process and constitute a
threat to international peace and security,

Increasingly concerned about the actions of armed Israeli settlers in the
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including Jerusalem,

comply with relevant Security Council resolutions, in accordance with the
Charter of the United Nations;

6. Stresses the need to preserve the territorial integrity of all of the

world;

illegal Israeli activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including
Jerusalem, in particular settlement activities;

Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War
to take measures, on a national or regional level, in fulfilment of their
obligations under article 1 of the Convention, to ensure respect by Israel, the
occupying Power, of the Convention;

interested parties and the entire international community to exert all the

provisions to ensure the freedom of religion and of conscience of its
inhabitants, as well as permanent, free and unhindered access to the Holy Places
by the faithful of all religions and nationalities;

12. Rejects terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, in accordance
with all relevant United Nations resolutions and declarations;
