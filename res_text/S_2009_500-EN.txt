 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming its commitment to the continuing and full implementation, in a 
mutually reinforcing manner, of resolutions 1325 (2000), 1612 (2005), 1674 (2006), 
1820 (2008), 1882 (2009), 1888 (2009) and all relevant Statements of its Presidents, 

 Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
and bearing in mind the primary responsibility of the Security Council under the 
Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security,  

 Recalling the resolve expressed in the 2005 United Nations General Assembly 
World Summit Outcome Document (A/RES/60/1) to eliminate all forms of violence 
against women and girls, the obligations of States Parties to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the Optional 
Protocol thereto, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional 
Protocols thereto, recalling also the commitments contained in the Beijing 
Declaration and Platform for Action as well as those contained in the outcome 
document of the twenty-third Special Session of the United Nations General 
Assembly entitled “Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the 
Twenty-First Century” (A/S-23/10/Rev.1), in particular those concerning women 
and armed conflict,  

 Having considered the report of the Secretary-General (S/2009/465) of 
16 September 2009 and stressing that the present resolution does not seek to make 
any legal determination as to whether situations that are referred to in the Secretary-
General’s report are or are not armed conflicts within the context of the Geneva 
Conventions and the Additional Protocols thereto, nor does it prejudge the legal 
status of the non-State parties involved in these situations, 

 Welcoming the efforts of Member States in implementing its resolution 
1325 (2000) at the national level, including the development of national action 
plans, and encouraging Member States to continue to pursue such implementation, 

 Reiterating the need for the full, equal and effective participation of women at 
all stages of peace processes given their vital role in the prevention and resolution of 
conflict and peacebuilding, reaffirming the key role women can play in 



S/2009/500  
 

09-54231 2 
 

re-establishing the fabric of recovering society and stressing the need for their 
involvement in the development and implementation of post-conflict strategies in 
order to take into account their perspectives and needs,  

 Expressing deep concern about the under-representation of women at all stages 
of peace processes, particularly the very low numbers of women in formal roles in 
mediation processes and stressing the need to ensure that women are appropriately 
appointed at decision-making levels, as high level mediators, and within the 
composition of the mediators’ teams, 

 Remaining deeply concerned about the persistent obstacles to women’s full 
involvement in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and participation in 
post-conflict public life, as a result of violence and intimidation, lack of security and 
lack of rule of law, cultural discrimination and stigmatization, including the rise of 
extremist or fanatical views on women, and socio-economic factors including the 
lack of access to education, and in this respect, recognizing that the marginalization 
of women can delay or undermine the achievement of durable peace, security and 
reconciliation, 

 Recognizing the particular needs of women and girls in post-conflict 
situations, including, inter alia, physical security, health services including 
reproductive and mental health, ways to ensure their livelihoods, land and property 
rights, employment, as well as their participation in decision-making and 
post-conflict planning, particularly at early stages of post-conflict peacebuilding,  

 Noting that despite progress, obstacles to strengthening women’s participation 
in conflict prevention, conflict resolution and peacebuilding remain, expressing 
concern that women’s capacity to engage in public decision making and economic 
recovery often does not receive adequate recognition or financing in post-conflict 
situations, and underlining that funding for women’s early recovery needs is vital to 
increase women’s empowerment, which can contribute to effective post-conflict 
peacebuilding,  

 Noting that women in situations of armed conflict and post-conflict situations 
continue to be often considered as victims and not as actors in addressing and 
resolving situations of armed conflict and stressing the need to focus not only on 
protection of women but also on their empowerment in peacebuilding,  

 Recognizing that an understanding of the impact of situations of armed conflict 
on women and girls, including as refugees and internally displaced persons, 
adequate and rapid response to their particular needs, and effective institutional 
arrangements to guarantee their protection and full participation in the peace 
process, particularly at early stages of post-conflict peacebuilding, can significantly 
contribute to the maintenance and promotion of international peace and security,  

 Welcoming the United Nations initiative to develop a system similar to that 
pioneered by the United Nations Development Programme to allow decision-makers 
to track gender-related allocations in United Nations Development Group 
Multi-Donor Trust Funds,  

 Welcoming the efforts of the Secretary-General to appoint more women to 
senior United Nations positions, particularly in field missions, as a tangible step 
towards providing United Nations leadership on implementation of its resolution 
1325 (2000),  



 S/2009/500
 

3 09-54231 
 

 Welcoming the upcoming establishment of a United Nations Steering 
Committee to enhance visibility and strengthen coordination within the United 
Nations system regarding the preparations for the 10th anniversary of resolution 
1325 (2000),  

 Encouraging relevant actors to organize events during 2009-2010 at the 
global, regional and national levels to increase awareness about resolution 
1325 (2000), including ministerial events, to renew commitments to “Women and 
peace and security”, and to identify ways to address remaining and new challenges 
in implementing resolution 1325 (2000) in the future, 

 1. Urges Member States, international and regional organisations to take 
further measures to improve women’s participation during all stages of peace 
processes, particularly in conflict resolution, post-conflict planning and 
peacebuilding, including by enhancing their engagement in political and economic

women’s leadership and capacity to engage in aid management and planning, 
supporting women’s organizations, and countering negative societal attitudes about

violence;  

 4. Calls upon the Secretary-General to develop a strategy, including through

women-protection advisors to United Nations missions and asks them, in

tracking of funds allocated for addressing women’s needs in the post-conflict phase; 

 10. Encourages Member States in post-conflict situations, in consultation 
with civil society, including women’s organizations, to specify in detail women and 
girls’ needs and priorities and design concrete strategies, in accordance with their 
legal systems, to address those needs and priorities, which cover inter alia support 
for greater physical security and better socio-economic conditions, through 
education, income generating activities, access to basic services, in particular health 
services, including sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights and 
mental health, gender-responsive law enforcement and access to justice, as well as 
enhancing capacity to engage in public decision-making at all levels;  

 11. Urges Member States, United Nations bodies and civil society, including 
non-governmental organizations, to take all feasible measures to ensure women and 
girls’ equal access to education in post-conflict situations, given the vital role of 
education in the promotion of women’s participation in post-conflict decision-
making; 

 12. Calls upon all parties to armed conflicts to respect the civilian and 
humanitarian character of refugee camps and settlements, and ensure the protection 
of all civilians inhabiting such camps, in particular women and girls, from all forms 
of violence, including rape and other sexual violence, and to ensure full, unimpeded 
and secure humanitarian access to them; 

 13. Calls upon all those involved in the planning for disarmament, 
demobilization and reintegration to take into account particular needs of women and

6 months, for consideration, a set of indicators for use at the global level to track 
implementation of its resolution 1325 (2000), which could serve as a common basis for
