by side in peace and security within recognized borders, based on the pre-1967 

borders;  

 2. Stresses the need to urgently exert collective efforts to launch credible 

negotiations on all final status issues in the Middle East peace process based on the

of a final just, lasting and comprehensive peace settlement;

international law and their previous agreements and obligations, in both their policies

political horizon and the advancement of peace efforts;

composition, character and status of the Territory, and thus at  prejudging the final 

outcome of peace negotiations, and recalls in this regard the principle of the 

inadmissibility of the acquisition of land by force and therefore the illegality of the 

annexation of any part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East

resolution 2334 (2016) of its determination to examine practical ways and means to 

secure the full implementation of its relevant resolutions;

 (d) To respect and ensure respect for international law, in all circumstances, 

including through measures of accountability, consistent with international law;  

 14. Urges all States and the United Nations to continue and expedite the 

provision of economic, humanitarian and technical assistance to the Palestinian 

people and the Palestinian Government during this critical period in order to help to 

alleviate the serious humanitarian situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 

including East Jerusalem, which is dire in the Gaza Strip, to rehabilitate the 

Palestinian economy and infrastructure and to support the development and 

strengthening of Palestinian institutions and Palestinian State-building efforts in
