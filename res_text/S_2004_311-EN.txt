The Security Council,

Expressing the desire to see a full and fair investigation of efforts by the

resolutions,

question the administration and management of the Oil-for-food Programme
(hereinafter the Programme) established pursuant to resolution 986 (1995) of 14
April 1995 and subsequent relevant resolutions, including allegations of fraud and
corruption,

Affirming that any illicit activity by United Nations officials, personnel and
agents, as well as contractors, including entities that have entered into contracts
under the Programme, is unacceptable,

Emphasizing the importance of full cooperation with the independent high-
