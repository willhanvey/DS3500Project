security,  

 Expressing its gravest concern at the nuclear test by the Democratic People’s 

Republic of Korea (“the DPRK”) on September 2, 2017 in violation of resolutions

missile-related activities have destabilized the region and beyond, and determining

have dangerous, large-scale regional security implications,  

 Underscoring its commitment to the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and 

political independence of all States in accordance with the Charter, and recalling the 

purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,
