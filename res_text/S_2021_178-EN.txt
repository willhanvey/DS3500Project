access of the Panel of Experts during the course of its last mandate,  

 Expressing serious concern at the devastating humanitarian situation in Yemen, 

including the growing risk of large-scale famine and the negative consequences of the 

COVID-19 pandemic, and all instances of undue hindrances to the effective delivery 

of humanitarian assistance, including the recent interference in aid operations in 

Houthi-controlled areas as well as obstacles and the undue limitations on the delivery 

of vital goods to the civilian population occurring throughout Yemen, which is 

preventing vulnerable people from receiving the assistance they need to survive,

activity from the sanctions measures imposed by the Security Council in resolutions 

2140 (2014) and 2216 (2015) if the Committee determines that such an exemption is

these resolutions;

stability of Yemen, as described in paragraph 17 of that resolution;  

 

  Reporting

2216 (2015), expresses its intention to review the mandate and take appropriate action 

regarding the further extension no later than 28 February 2022, and requests the 

Secretary-General to take the necessary administrative measures as expeditiously as 

possible to re-establish the Panel of Experts, in consultation with the Committee until

established pursuant to resolution 2140 (2014);

Committee no later than 28 July 2021, and a final report no later than 28 January 2022 

to the Security Council, after discussion with the Committee, and also that they 

include information, as appropriate, inter alia about the recent trend in the illicit 

transfer and diversion of conventional weapons and about the commercially available 

components which have been used by individuals or entities designated by the 

Committee to assemble unmanned aerial vehicles, water-borne improvised explosive 

devices, and other weapon systems, and bearing in mind that this request should not 

have an adverse impact on humanitarian assistance or legitimate commercial 

activities; 

 11. Directs the Panel to cooperate with other relevant expert groups 

established by the Security Council to support the work of its Sanctions Committees,

 12. Urges all parties and all Member States, as well as international, regional 

and subregional organisations to ensure cooperation with the Panel of Experts, and 

further urges all Member States involved to ensure the safety of the members of the 

Panel of Experts and unhindered access, in particular to persons, documents and sites, 

in order for the Panel of Experts to execute its mandate; 

 13. Emphasises the importance of holding consultations with concerned 

Member States, as may be necessary, in order to ensure full implementation of the 

measures set forth in this resolution;  

 14. Recalls the Informal Working Group on General Issues of Sanctions report 

(S/2006/997) on best practices and methods, including paragraphs 21, 22 and 23 that 

discuss possible steps for clarifying methodological standards for monitoring 

mechanisms; 

 15. Reaffirms its intention to keep the situation in Yemen under continuous

this resolution, including the strengthening, modification, suspension or lifting of the 

measures, as may be needed at any time in light of developments;
