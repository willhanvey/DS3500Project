Reaffirming its determination to put an end to the suffering and casualties
caused by anti-personnel mines, which kill or maim hundreds of people every week,
mostly innocent and defenceless civilians and especially children, obstruct
economic development and reconstruction, inhibit the repatriation of refugees and

emplacement,

A/C.1/59/L.40/Rev.1

Believing it necessary to do the utmost to contribute in an efficient and
coordinated manner to facing the challenge of removing anti-personnel mines placed
throughout the world and to assure their destruction,

Wishing to do the utmost in ensuring assistance for the care and rehabilitation,
including the social and economic reintegration, of mine victims,

Welcoming the entry into force, on 1 March 1999, of the Convention on the
Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel
Mines and on Their Destruction,1 and noting with satisfaction the work undertaken
to implement the Convention and the substantial progress made towards addressing
the global landmine problem,

Recalling the First to Fifth Meetings of the States Parties to the Convention
held at Maputo (1999),2 Geneva (2000),3 Managua (2001),4 Geneva (2002)5 and
Bangkok (2003),6 and the reaffirmation of a commitment to the total elimination of
anti-personnel mines and to pursue, with renewed vigour, efforts to clear mined
areas, assist victims, destroy stockpiled anti-personnel mines and promote universal
adherence to the Convention,

Recalling also the preparatory process for the Convention’s First Review
Conference, to be held in Nairobi from 29 November to 3 December 2004, and the
two preparatory meetings held in 2004 pursuant to the decisions of the Fifth
Meeting of the States Parties,7

Welcoming the regional seminars that have been held in different parts of the
world during 2003 and 2004, which contributed to the exchange of information,
experiences and best practices in mine action as well as to preparations for the First
Review Conference, and recalling the efforts to enhance cooperation in regional
context and promote synergies between different regions,

Noting with interest the increased recognition of the need to integrate mine
action into international and national development programmes and strategies, and,
in this respect, welcoming the developments since the Fifth Meeting of the States
Parties, including the meeting between the President of the Fifth Meeting of the
States Parties and the President of the World Bank on 20 September 2004, which
contributed to possible partnership between the mine action community and the
World Bank,

Noting with satisfaction that additional States have ratified or acceded to the
Convention, bringing the total number of States that have formally accepted the
obligations of the Convention to one hundred and forty-three,

Emphasizing the desirability of attracting the adherence of all States to the
Convention, and determined to work strenuously towards the promotion of its
universalization,
