The Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation

The General Assembly,

Concerned about the increasing regional and global security challenges
caused, inter alia, by the ongoing proliferation of ballistic missiles capable of
delivering weapons of mass destruction,

Bearing in mind the purposes and principles of the United Nations and its role
and responsibility in the field of international peace and security in accordance with
the Charter of the United Nations,

Emphasizing the significance of regional and international efforts to prevent
and curb comprehensively the proliferation of ballistic missile systems capable of
delivering weapons of mass destruction, as a contribution to international peace and
security,

A/C.1/60/L.22

Welcoming the adoption of the Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic
Missile Proliferation1 on 25 November 2002 at The Hague, and convinced that the
Code will contribute to enhancing transparency and confidence among States,

Recalling its resolution 59/91 of 3 December 2004, entitled “The Hague Code
of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation”,

Confirming its commitment to the Declaration on International Cooperation in
the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for the Benefit and in the Interest of All
States, Taking into Particular Account the Needs of Developing Countries, as
contained in the annex to its resolution 51/122 of 13 December 1996,

Recognizing that States should not be excluded from utilizing the benefits of
space for peaceful purposes, but that in reaping such benefits and in conducting
related cooperation they must not contribute to the proliferation of ballistic missiles
capable of carrying weapons of mass destruction,

Mindful of the need to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
and their means of delivery,

1. Notes with satisfaction that one hundred and twenty-two States have
already subscribed to the Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile
Proliferation as a practical step against the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and their means of delivery;

2. Invites all States that have not yet subscribed to the Code of Conduct to
do so;

3. Encourages the exploration of further ways and means to deal effectively
with the problem of the proliferation of ballistic missiles capable of delivering
weapons of mass destruction;

4. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-first session an
item entitled “The Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation”.
