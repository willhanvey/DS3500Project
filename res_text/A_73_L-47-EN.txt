 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling the Charter of the United Nations, which states, inter alia, that all 

Members of the United Nations shall refrain in their international relations from the 

threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any 

State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations,  

 Recalling also its resolution 68/262 of 27 March 2014 on the territorial integrity 

of Ukraine, in which it affirmed its commitment to the sovereignty, political 

independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally 

recognized borders,  

 Recalling further its resolutions 71/205 and 72/190 on the situation of human 

rights in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine, of 

19 December 2016 and 19 December 2017, respectively, 

 Condemning the ongoing temporary occupation of part of the territory of 

Ukraine, namely, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol 

(hereinafter referred to as “Crimea”), by the Russian Federation, and reaffirming the 

non-recognition of its annexation,  

 Recalling that the temporary occupation of Crimea and the threat or use of force 

against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine by the Russian 

Federation is in contravention of commitments made under the Memorandum on 

Security Assurances in Connection with Ukraine’s Accession to the Treaty on the 

Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (Budapest Memorandum) of 5 December

1994, 1  in which, inter alia, the commitment to respect the independence and 

sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine was reaffirmed,  

 Supporting the commitment by Ukraine to adhere to international law in its 

efforts to put an end to the temporary Russian occupation of Crimea,  

 1. Stresses that the presence of Russian troops in Crimea is contrary to the 

national sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine and 

undermines the security and stability of neighbouring countries and the European 

region; 

 2. Expresses its grave concern over the progressive militarization of Crimea 

by the Russian Federation as the occupying Power, and also expresses concern over 

reports of the continuing destabilization of Crimea owing to transfers by the Russian 

Federation of weapon systems, including nuclear-capable aircraft and missiles, 

weapons, ammunition and military personnel to the territory of Ukraine, and urges 

the Russian Federation to stop such activity;  

 3. Expresses its concern regarding multiple military exercises of Russian 

armed forces held in Crimea, which can undermine regional security and entail 

considerable long-term negative environmental consequences in the region;  

 4. Also expresses its concern over the Russian Federation’s ongoing actions 

in parts of the Black Sea surrounding Crimea and the Sea of Azov, including the ir 

militarization, which pose further threats to Ukraine and undermine the stability of 

the broader region;  

 5. Expresses its utmost concern about the dangerous increase in tensions and 

the unjustified use of force by the Russian Federation against Ukraine, including 

against three vessels of the naval forces of Ukraine, namely, the Berdyansk, the 

Nikopol and the tugboat Yana Kapu, on 25 November 2018 in the Black Sea, as well 

as the serious wounding of some of their crew members, calls upon the Russian 

Federation to release the vessels and their crews and equipment unconditionally and 

without delay, and also calls for the utmost restraint to de-escalate the situation 

immediately; 

 6. Calls upon the Russian Federation to refrain from impeding the lawful 

exercise of navigational rights and freedoms in the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov and 

the Kerch Strait in accordance with applicable international law, in particular 

provisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea; 2  

 7. Condemns the Russian Federation’s construction and opening of the Kerch 

Strait bridge between the Russian Federation and temporarily occupied Crimea, 

which facilitates the further militarization of Crimea, and also condemns the 

increasing military presence of the Russian Federation in parts of the Black Sea and 

the Sea of Azov, including the Kerch Strait, and the Russian Federation’s harassment 

of commercial vessels and restriction of international shipping there;  

 8. Urges the Russian Federation, as the occupying Power, to withdraw its 

military forces from Crimea and to end its temporary occupation of Ukraine ’s 

territory without delay;  

 9. Decides to continue its consideration of the matter at its seventy-fourth 

session.
