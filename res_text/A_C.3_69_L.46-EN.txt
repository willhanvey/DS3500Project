 Reiterating its continuing support for the New Partnership for Africa’s 
Development11 as a development framework for Africa, 

 Expressing its appreciation for the efforts of the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on the Right to Development of the Human Rights Council and the 
members of the high-level task force on the implementation of the right to 
development in completing the 2008-2010 three-phase road map established by the 
Council in its resolution 4/4 of 30 March 2007,12  

 Deeply concerned about the negative impacts of the global economic and 
financial crises on the realization of the right to development, 

 Recognizing that, while development facilitates the enjoyment of all human 
rights, the lack of development may not be invoked to justify the abridgement of 
internationally recognized human rights, 

 Recognizing also that Member States should cooperate with each other in 
ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development, that the international 
community should promote effective international cooperation for the realization of 
the right to development and the elimination of obstacles to development and that 
lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires 
effective development policies at the national level, as well as equitable economic 
relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level, 

 Recognizing further that poverty is an affront to human dignity, 

 Recognizing that extreme poverty and hunger are one of the greatest global 
threats and require the collective commitment of the international community for its 
eradication, pursuant to Millennium Development Goal 1, and therefore calling 
upon the international community, including the Human Rights Council, to 
contribute towards achieving that goal, 

 Recognizing also that historical injustices have undeniably contributed to the 
poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion, economic disparity, 
instability and insecurity that affect many people in different parts of the world, in 
particular in developing countries, 

 Stressing that poverty eradication is one of the critical elements in the 
promotion and realization of the right to development and that poverty is a 
multifaceted problem that requires a multifaceted and integrated approach in 
addressing economic, political, social, environmental and institutional dimensions at 
all levels, especially in the context of the Millennium Development Goal of halving, 
by 2015, the proportion of the world’s people whose income is less than one United 
States dollar a day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, 

 Stressing also that the right to development should be central to the post-2015 
development agenda and that according to article 1 of the Declaration on the Right 
to Development, the right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of 
which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute 
to and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development, in which all 
human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized,

consideration of an international legal standard of a binding nature through a 
collaborative process of engagement; 

 9. Stresses the importance of the core principles contained in the 
conclusions of the Working Group at its third session,18 congruent with the purpose 
of international human rights instruments, such as equality, non-discrimination, 
accountability, participation and international cooperation, as critical to 
mainstreaming the right to development at the national and international levels, and 
underlines the importance of the principles of equity and transparency; 

 10. Also stresses that it is important that the Chair-Rapporteur and the 
Working Group, in the discharge of their mandates, take into account the need: 

 (a) To promote the democratization of the system of international 
governance in order to increase the effective participation of developing countries in 
international decision-making; 

 (b) To also promote effective partnerships such as the New Partnership for 
Africa’s Development11 and other similar initiatives with the developing countries, 
particularly the least developed countries, for the purpose of the realization of their 
right to development, including the achievement of the Millennium Development 
Goals; 

 (c) To strive for greater acceptance, operationalization and realization of the 
right to development at the international level, while urging all States to undertake 
at the national level the necessary policy formulation and to institute the measures 
required for the implementation of the right to development as an integral part of all 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, and also urging all States to expand and 
deepen mutually beneficial cooperation in ensuring development and eliminating 
obstacles to development in the context of promoting effective international 
cooperation for the realization of the right to development, bearing in mind that 
lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires 
effective development policies at the national level and a favourable economic 
environment at the international level; 

 (d) To consider ways and means to continue to ensure the operationalization 
of the right to development as a priority; 

 (e) To mainstream the right to development in the policies and operational 
activities of the United Nations and the specialized agencies, funds and 
programmes, as well as in the policies and strategies of the international financial 
and multilateral trading systems, bearing in mind in this regard that the core 
principles of the international economic, commercial and financial spheres, such as 
equity, non-discrimination, transparency, accountability, participation and 
international cooperation, including effective partnerships for development, are 
indispensable in achieving the right to development and preventing discriminatory 
treatment arising from political or other non-economic considerations in addressing 
the issues of concern to the developing countries; 

 11. Encourages the Human Rights Council to continue considering how to 
ensure follow-up to the work of the former Subcommission on the Promotion and

relevant provisions of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the 
Commission on Human Rights and in compliance with decisions to be taken by the 
Council; 

 12. Invites Member States and all other stakeholders to participate actively in 
future sessions of the Social Forum, while recognizing the strong support extended 
to the Forum at its first four sessions by the Subcommission on the Promotion and 
Protection of Human Rights; 

 13. Reaffirms the commitment to implement the goals and targets set out in 
all the outcome documents of the major United Nations conferences and summits 
and their review processes, in particular those relating to the realization of the right 
to development, recognizing that the realization of the right to development is 
critical to achieving the objectives, goals and targets set in those outcome 
documents; 

 14. Also reaffirms that the realization of the right to development is essential 
to the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which 
regards all human rights as universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, 
places the human person at the centre of development and recognizes that, while 
development facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights, lack of development may 
not be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally recognized human 
rights; 

 15. Stresses that the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection 
of all human rights lies with the State, and reaffirms that States have the primary 
responsibility for their own economic and social development and that the role of 
national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized; 

 16. Reaffirms the primary responsibility of States to create national and 
international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to development, as

conducive to the realization of the right to development;

freedoms; 

 19. Emphasizes the critical importance of identifying and analysing obstacles 
impeding the full realization of the right to development at both the national and 
international levels; 

 20. Affirms that, while globalization offers both opportunities and challenges, 
the process of globalization remains deficient in achieving the objectives of 
integrating all countries into a globalized world, and stresses the need for policies 
and measures at the national and global levels to respond to the challenges and 
opportunities of globalization if this process is to be made fully inclusive and 
equitable; 

 21. Recognizes that, despite continuous efforts on the part of the 
international community, the gap between developed and developing countries 



 A/C.3/69/L.46

 

7/9 14-63850 
 

remains unacceptably wide, that most of the developing countries continue to face 
difficulties in participating in the globalization process and that many risk being 
marginalized and effectively excluded from its benefits; 

 22. Expresses its deep concern, in this regard, about the negative impact on 
the realization of the right to development due to the further aggravation of the 
economic and social situation, in particular of developing countries, as a result of 
the ongoing international energy, food and financial crises, as well as the increasing 
challenges posed by global climate change and the loss of biodiversity, which have 
increased vulnerabilities and inequalities and have adversely affected development 
gains, in particular in developing countries; 

 23. Underlines the fact that the international community is far from meeting 
the target set in the United Nations Millennium Declaration4 of halving the number 
of people living in poverty by 2015, reaffirms the commitment made to meet that 
target, and emphasizes the principle of international cooperation, including 
partnership and commitment, between developed and developing countries towards 
achieving the goal; 

 24. Urges developed countries that have not yet done so to make concrete 
efforts towards meeting the targets of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for 
official development assistance to developing countries and 0.15 to 0.2 per cent of 
their gross national product to least developed countries, and encourages developing 
countries to build on the progress achieved in ensuring that official development 
assistance is used effectively to help to meet development goals and targets; 

 25. Recognizes the need to address market access for developing countries, 
including in the sectors of agriculture, services and non-agricultural products, in 
particular those of interest to developing countries; 

 26. Calls once again for the implementation of a desirable pace of 
meaningful trade liberalization, including in areas under negotiation in the World 
Trade Organization, the implementation of commitments on implementation-related 
issues and concerns, a review of special and differential treatment provisions, with a 
view to strengthening them and making them more precise, effective and 
operational, the avoidance of new forms of protectionism, and capacity-building and 
technical assistance for developing countries as important issues in making progress 
towards the effective implementation of the right to development; 

 27. Recognizes the important link between the international economic, 
commercial and financial spheres and the realization of the right to development, 
stresses in this regard the need for good governance and for broadening the base of 
decision-making at the international level on issues of development concern and the 
need to fill organizational gaps, as well as to strengthen the United Nations system 
and other multilateral institutions, and also stresses the need to broaden and 
strengthen the participation of developing countries and countries with economies in 
transition in international economic decision-making and norm-setting; 

 28. Also recognizes that good governance and the rule of law at the national 
level assist all States in the promotion and protection of human rights, including the 
right to development, and agrees on the value of the ongoing efforts being made by 
States to identify and strengthen good governance practices, including transparent, 
responsible, accountable and participatory government, that are responsive and 



A/C.3/69/L.46  
 

14-63850 8/9 
 

appropriate to their needs and aspirations, including in the context of agreed 
partnership approaches to development, capacity-building and technical assistance; 

 29. Further recognizes the important role and the rights of women and the 
application of a gender perspective as a cross-cutting issue in the process of 
realizing the right to development, and notes in particular the positive relationship 
between the education of women and their equal participation in the civil, cultural, 
economic, political and social activities of the community and the promotion of the 
right to development; 

 30. Stresses the need for the integration of the rights of children, girls and 
boys alike, in all policies and programmes and for ensuring the promotion and 
protection of those rights, especially in areas relating to health, education and the 
full development of their capacities; 

 31. Recalls the Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Intensifying Our 
Efforts to Eliminate HIV and AIDS, adopted on 10 June 2011 at the high-level 
meeting of the General Assembly on HIV and AIDS,19 stresses that further and 
additional measures must be taken at the national and international levels to fight 
HIV and AIDS and other communicable diseases, taking into account ongoing 
efforts and programmes, and reiterates the need for international assistance in this 
regard; 

 32. Welcomes the political declaration of the high-level meeting of the 
General Assembly on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases, 
adopted on 19 September 2011,20 with its particular focus on development and other 
challenges and social and economic impacts, particularly for developing countries; 

 33. Recalls the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on 
Sustainable Development, entitled “The future we want”;21  

 34. Also recalls the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,22 
which entered into force on 3 May 2008, and stresses the need to take into 
consideration the rights of persons with disabilities and the importance of 
international cooperation in support of national efforts in the realization of the right 
to development; 

 35. Stresses its commitment to indigenous peoples in the process of the 
realization of the right to development, reaffirms the commitment to promote their 
rights in the areas of education, employment, vocational training and retraining, 
housing, sanitation, health and social security, in accordance with recognized 
international human rights obligations and taking into account, as appropriate, the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted by the 
General Assembly in its resolution 61/295 of 13 September 2007, and in this regard 
recalls the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, held in 2014; 

 36. Recognizes the need for strong partnerships with civil society 
organizations and the private sector in pursuit of poverty eradication and 
development, as well as for corporate social responsibility;

provide the Office of the High Commissioner with the necessary resources;

institutions and to reflect those activities in detail in his next report to the Human
