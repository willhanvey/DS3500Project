 Recalling its decision 59/515 of 3 December 2004 and its resolution 60/74 of 
8 December 2005, by which it decided to include the issue of conventional 
ammunition stockpiles in surplus in the agenda of its sixty-first session, 

 1. Encourages all interested States to assess, on a voluntary basis, whether, 
in conformity with their legitimate security needs, parts of their stockpiles of 
conventional ammunition should be considered to be in surplus, and recognizes that 
the security of such stockpiles must be taken into consideration and that appropriate 
controls with regard to the security and safety of stockpiles of conventional 
ammunition are indispensable at the national level in order to eliminate the risk of 
explosion, pollution or diversion; 

 2. Appeals to all interested States to determine the size and nature of their 
surplus stockpiles of conventional ammunition, whether they represent a security 
risk, if appropriate, their means of destruction, and whether external assistance is 
needed to eliminate this risk; 

 3. Encourages States in a position to do so to assist interested States within 
a bilateral framework or through international or regional organizations, on a 
voluntary and transparent basis, in elaborating and implementing programmes to 
eliminate surplus stockpiles or to improve their management; 

 4. Encourages all Member States to examine the possibility of developing 
and implementing, within a national, regional or subregional framework, measures 
to address accordingly the illicit trafficking related to the accumulation of such 
stockpiles; 

 5. Requests the Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States 
regarding the risks arising from the accumulation of conventional ammunition 
stockpiles in surplus and regarding national ways of strengthening controls on 
conventional ammunition, and to submit a report to the General Assembly at its 
sixty-second session; 

 6. Decides to address the issue of conventional ammunition stockpiles in 
surplus in a comprehensive manner; 

 7. Requests the Secretary-General to establish a group of governmental 
experts, commencing no later than 2008, to consider further steps to enhance 
cooperation with regard to the issue of conventional ammunition stockpiles in 
surplus, and to transmit the report of the Group of Experts to the General Assembly 
for consideration at its sixty-third session; 

 8. Decides to include this issue in the provisional agenda of its sixty-third 
session.
