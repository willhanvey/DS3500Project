moratorium on the use of the death penalty, in which the General Assembly called 
upon States that still maintain the death penalty to establish a moratorium on 
executions with a view to abolishing it,  

 Welcoming Human Rights Council decision 18/117 of 28 September 2011,4 

 Mindful that any miscarriage or failure of justice in the implementation of the 
death penalty is irreversible and irreparable,  

 Convinced that a moratorium on the use of the death penalty contributes to 
respect for human dignity and to the enhancement and progressive development of 
human rights, and considering that there is no conclusive evidence of the deterrent 
value of the death penalty,  

 Noting ongoing local and national debates and regional initiatives on the death 
penalty, as well as the readiness of an increasing number of Member States to make 
available to the public information on the use of the death penalty,  

 Noting also the technical cooperation among Member States in relation to 
moratoriums on the death penalty,  

 1. Expresses its deep concern about the continued application of the death 
penalty;  

 2. Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of 
resolution 65/2065 and the recommendations contained therein;  

 3. Also welcomes the steps taken by some Member States to reduce the 
number of offences for which the death penalty may be imposed and the decisions 
made by an increasing number of States, at all levels of Government, to apply a 
moratorium on executions, followed in many cases by the abolition of the death 
penalty;  

 4. Calls upon all States:  

 (a) To respect international standards that provide safeguards guaranteeing 
protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, in particular the minimum 
standards, as set out in the annex to Economic and Social Council resolution 
1984/50 of 25 May 1984, as well as to provide the Secretary-General with 
information in this regard;  

 (b) To make available relevant information with regard to their use of the 
death penalty, inter alia, the number of persons sentenced to death, the number of 
persons on death row and the number of executions carried out, which can 
contribute to possible informed and transparent national and international debates, 
including on the obligations of States pertaining to the use of the death penalty;  

 (c) To progressively restrict the use of the death penalty and not to impose 
capital punishment for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age 
and on pregnant women;  

 (d) To reduce the number of offences for which the death penalty may be 
imposed;
