development required the meaningful involvement and active participation of 

regional, national and subnational legislatures and judiciaries, and all major groups, 

and, in this regard, that they agreed to work more closely with major groups and 

other stakeholders and encouraged their active participation, as appropriate, in 

processes that contribute to decision-making, planning and implementation of 

policies and programmes for sustainable development at all levels,  

 Conscious that the problems of ocean space are closely interrelated and need 

to be considered as a whole through an integrated, interdisciplinary and intersectoral 

approach, and reaffirming the need to improve cooperation and coordination at the 

national, regional and global levels, in accordance with the Convention, to support 

and supplement the efforts of each State in promoting the implementation and 

observance of the Convention and the integrated management and sustainable 

development of the oceans and seas,  

 Reiterating the essential need for cooperation, including through capacity-

building and transfer of marine technology, to ensure that all States, especially 

developing countries, in particular the least developed countries and small island 

developing States, as well as coastal African States, are able both to implement the 

Convention and to benefit from the sustainable development of the oceans and seas, 

as well as to participate fully in global and regional forums and processes dealing 

with oceans and law of the sea issues,  

 Emphasizing the need to strengthen the ability of competent international 

organizations to contribute, at the global, regional, subregional and bilateral levels, 

through cooperation programmes with Governments, to the development of national 

capacity in marine science and the sustainable management of the oceans and their 

resources,  

 Recalling that marine science is important for eradicating poverty, contributing 

to food security, conserving the world’s marine environment and resources, helping 

to understand, predict and respond to natural events and promoting the sustainable 

development of the oceans and seas, by improving knowledge, through sustained 

research efforts and the evaluation of monitoring results, and applying such 

knowledge to management and decision-making,

reclamation activities that are carried out in a manner that has a detrimenta l impact 

on the marine environment,  

 Reiterating its serious concern at the current and projected adverse effects of 

climate change and ocean acidification on the marine environment and marine 

biodiversity, and emphasizing the urgency of addressing these issues,  



A/69/L.29 
 

 

14-66001 4/51 

 

 Expressing concern that climate change continues to increase the severity and 

incidence of coral bleaching throughout tropical seas and weakens the ability of 

reefs to withstand ocean acidification, which could have serious and irreversible 

negative effects on marine organisms, particularly corals, as well as to withstand 

other pressures, including overfishing and pollution,   

 Reiterating its deep concern at the vulnerability of the environment and the 

fragile ecosystems of the polar regions, including the Arctic Ocean and the Arctic 

ice cap, particularly affected by the projected adverse effects of climate change and 

ocean acidification,

critical to the safety of navigation and life at sea, environmental protection, 

including the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems, and the economics of the 

global shipping industry, and encouraging further efforts towards electronic 

charting, which not only provides significantly increased benefits for safe 

navigation and management of ship movement, but also provides data and 

information that can be used for sustainable fisheries activities and other sectoral 

uses of the marine environment, the delimitation of maritime boundaries and 

environmental protection, and noting that under the International Convention for the 

Safety of Life at Sea, 1974,10 ships on international voyages are required to carry an 

electronic chart display and information system, in accordance with the 

implementation schedule as set out in that Convention,   

 Recognizing that ocean data buoys deployed and operated in accordance with 

international law are critical for improving understanding of weather, climate and 

ecosystems, and that certain types of ocean data buoys contribute to saving lives by 

detecting tsunamis, and reiterating its serious concern at intentional and 

unintentional damage to such buoys,  

 Emphasizing that underwater archaeological, cultural and historical heritage, 

including shipwrecks and watercraft, holds essential information on the history of 

humankind and that such heritage is a resource that needs to be protected and 

preserved,  

 Noting with concern the continuing problem of transnational organized crime 

committed at sea, including illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic 

substances, the smuggling of migrants, trafficking in persons and illicit trafficking 

in firearms, and threats to maritime safety and security, including piracy, armed 

robbery at sea, smuggling and terrorist acts against shipping, offshore installations 

and other maritime interests, and noting the deplorable loss of life and adverse 

impact on international trade, energy security and the global economy resulting 

from such activities,
