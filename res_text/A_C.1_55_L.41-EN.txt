Nuclear disarmament

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolution 49/75 E of 15 December 1994 on a step-by-step
reduction of the nuclear threat, and its resolution 50/70 P of 12 December 1995,
51/45 O of 10 December 1996, 52/38 L of 9 December 1997, 53/77 X of
4 December 1998 and 54/54 P of 1 December 1999 on nuclear disarmament,

Reaffirming the commitment of the international community to the goal of the
total elimination of nuclear weapons and the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free
world,

Bearing in mind that the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,
Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and
on Their Destruction of 1972 and the Convention on the Prohibition of the
Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their
Destruction of 1993 have already established legal regimes on the complete
prohibition of biological and chemical weapons, respectively, and determined to
achieve a nuclear weapons convention on the prohibition of the development,
testing, production, stockpiling, loan, transfer, use and threat of use of nuclear
weapons and on their destruction, and to conclude such an international convention
at an early date,

Recognizing that there now exist conditions for the establishment of a nuclear-
weapon-free world;

A/C.1/55/L.41

Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special
Session of the General Assembly, the first special session devoted to disarmament,
calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative
improvement and development of nuclear-weapons systems, and for a
comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time-frames, wherever feasible,
for the progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of
delivery, leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible
time,

Noting the reiteration by the States parties to the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of their conviction that the Treaty is a cornerstone
of nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament and the reaffirmation by the
States parties of the importance of the decision on strengthening the review process
for the Treaty, the decision on principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation
and disarmament, the decision on the extension of the Treaty and the resolution on
the Middle East, adopted by the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,

Reiterating the highest priority accorded to nuclear disarmament in the Final
Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly and by the
international community,

Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any
proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive
devices must constitute disarmament measures, and not only non-proliferation
measures,

Welcoming the entry into force of the Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation
of Strategic Offensive Arms (START I), to which Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Russian
Federation, Ukraine and the United States of America are States parties,

Welcoming also the ratification of the Treaty on Further Reduction and
Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (START II) by the Russian Federation and
looking forward to its early entry into force and its full implementation and to an
early commencement of START III negotiations,

Noting with appreciation the unilateral measures by the nuclear-weapon States
for nuclear arms limitation, and encouraging them to undertake further such
measures,

Recognizing the complementarity of bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral
negotiations on nuclear disarmament, and that bilateral negotiations can never
replace multilateral negotiations in this respect,

Noting the support in the Conference on Disarmament and in the General
Assembly for the elaboration of an international convention to assure non-nuclear-
weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, and the
multilateral efforts in the Conference on Disarmament to reach agreement on such
an international convention at an early date,

Recalling the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the
Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, issued on 8 July 1996, and
welcoming the unanimous reaffirmation by all Judges of the Court that there exists
an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion

negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and
effective international control,

Mindful of paragraph 114 and other relevant recommendations in the Final
Document of the Twelfth Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-
Aligned Countries, held at Durban, South Africa, from 29 August to 3 September
1998, calling upon the Conference on Disarmament to establish, on a priority basis,
an ad hoc committee to commence negotiations in 1998 on a phased programme of
nuclear disarmament and for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons with a
specified framework of time,

Recalling paragraph 72 of the Final Document of the XIIIth Ministerial
Conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Cartagena on
8-9 April 2000,

1. Recognizes that, in view of recent political developments, the time is now
opportune for all the nuclear-weapon States to undertake effective disarmament
measures with a view to the elimination of these weapons;

2. Also recognizes that there is a genuine need to diminish the role of
nuclear weapons in security policies to minimize the risk that these weapons will
ever be used and to facilitate the process of their total elimination;

3. Urges the nuclear-weapon States to stop immediately the qualitative
improvement, development, production and stockpiling of nuclear warheads and
their delivery systems;

measures to further reduce the operational status of their nuclear weapon systems;

5. Reiterates its call upon the nuclear-weapon States to undertake the step-
by-step reduction of the nuclear threat and to carry out effective nuclear
disarmament measures with a view to the total elimination of these weapons;

6. Calls upon the nuclear-weapon States, pending the achievement of the
total elimination of nuclear weapons, to agree on an internationally and legally
binding instrument on the joint undertaking not to be the first to use nuclear
weapons, and calls upon all States to conclude an internationally and legally binding
instrument on security assurances of non-use and non-threat of use of nuclear
weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States;

7. Urges the nuclear-weapon States to commence plurilateral negotiations
among themselves at an appropriate stage on further deep reductions of nuclear
weapons as an effective measure of nuclear disarmament;

8. Underscores the importance of observing the principles of irreversibility
to the process of nuclear disarmament, nuclear and other related arms control and
reduction measures;

9. Welcomes the positive outcome of the 2000 Review Conference of the
States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the
unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon States, in the Final Document of the
Conference, to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to
nuclear disarmament, to which all States Parties are committed under Article 6 of
the Treaty and the reaffirmation by the States Parties that the total elimination of



4

A/C.1/55/L.41

nuclear weapons is the only absolute guarantee against the use or threat of use of
nuclear weapons, and calls for the full and effective implementation of the steps set
out in the Final Document;

10. Calls for the immediate commencement of negotiations in the
Conference on Disarmament, on a non-discriminatory, multilateral and
internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile
material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of the
report of the Special Coordinator (CD/1299) and the mandate contained therein;

11. Urges the Conference on Disarmament to agree on a programme of work
which includes the immediate commencement of negotiations on such a treaty with
a view to their conclusion within five years;

12. Calls for the conclusion of an international legal instrument or
instruments on adequate security assurances to non-nuclear-weapon States;

13. Calls for the early entry into force and strict observance of the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty;

14. Expresses its regret that the Conference on Disarmament was unable to
establish an ad hoc committee on nuclear disarmament at its 2000 session, as called
for in General Assembly resolution 54/54 P;

15. Reiterates its call upon the Conference on Disarmament to establish, on a
priority basis, an ad hoc committee to deal with nuclear disarmament early in 2001
and to commence negotiations on a phased programme of nuclear disarmament
leading to the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons;

16. Calls for the convening of an international conference on nuclear
disarmament in all its aspects at an early date to identify and deal with concrete
measures of nuclear disarmament;

17. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its
