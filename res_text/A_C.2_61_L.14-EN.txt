 Reiterating that development concerns form an integral part of the Doha 
Development Agenda, which places the needs and interests of developing and least 
developed countries at the heart of the Doha work programme,2 

 Noting that agriculture lags behind the manufacturing sector in the process of 
establishment of multilateral disciplines and in the reduction of tariff and non-tariff 
barriers and that, since most of the world’s poor make their living out of agriculture, 
the livelihood and standards of living of many of them are seriously jeopardized by 
the serious distortions in production and trade in agricultural products caused by the 
high levels of export subsidies, trade distorting domestic support and protectionism 
by many developed countries, 

 Taking note of the reports of the Trade and Development Board3 as well as the 
report of the Secretary-General,4 

 1. Expresses serious concern over the indefinite suspension of the trade 
negotiations of the World Trade Organization and considers it a serious setback for 
the Doha Round, which places development at the heart of the multilateral trading 
system and calls upon the developed countries to demonstrate the flexibility and 
political will necessary for breaking the current impasse in the negotiations, and 
further calls for an early resumption of negotiations adhering to the development 
imperatives and commitments of the Doha Ministerial Declaration,2 the decision of 
1 August 2004 of the General Council of the World Trade Organization5 and the 
Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration; 

 2. Stresses that in order for the Doha Round to be concluded satisfactorily, 
the negotiations should result in the establishment of rules and disciplines in the 
area of agriculture, adhering to the development imperatives and commitments of 
the Doha Ministerial Declaration, the decision of 1 August 2004 of the General 
Council of the World Trade Organization and the Hong Kong Ministerial 
Declaration; 

 3. Stresses the need that World Trade Organization negotiations in  
non-agricultural market access live up to development imperatives and 
commitments of the Doha Ministerial Declaration, the decision of 1 August 2004 of 
the General Council of the World Trade Organization and the Hong Kong 
Ministerial Declaration; 

 4. Underlines the fact that the increasing interdependence of national 
economies in a globalizing world and the emergence of rule-based regimes for 
international economic relations have meant that the space for national economic 
policy, that is, the scope for domestic policies, especially in the areas of trade, 
investment and industrial development, is now often framed by international 
disciplines, commitments and global market considerations, that it is for each 
Government to evaluate the trade-off between the benefits of accepting international 
rules and commitments and the constraints posed by the loss of policy space, and 
that it is particularly important for developing countries that all countries take into

account the need for appropriate balance between national policy space and 
international disciplines and commitments; 

 5. Expresses its deep concern about the imposition of laws and other forms 
of coercive economic measures including unilateral sanctions against developing

Organization, and also severely threaten the freedom of trade and investment;  

 6. Reaffirms the commitments made at the Fourth Ministerial Conference of 
the World Trade Organization2 and at the Third United Nations Conference on the 
Least Developed Countries,6 in this regard calls upon developed countries that have 
not already done so to provide immediate predictable, duty-free and quota-free 
market access on a lasting basis to all products originating from all least developed 
countries, also calls upon developing countries that are in a position to do so to 
extend duty-free and quota-free market access to exports of these countries, and in 
this context reaffirms also the need to consider additional measures for progressive 
improvement in market access for least developed countries; 

 7. Also reaffirms the commitment to actively pursue the work programme of

need for the implementation of the São Paulo Consensus,8 in particular paragraphs 
66 and 84 thereof, by the relevant international organizations and donors in a multi-
stakeholder approach; 

 9. Recognizes the need to ensure that the comparative advantage of 
developing countries is not undermined by any form of protectionism, including the 
arbitrary and abusive use of non-tariff measures, non-trade barriers and other 
standards to unfairly restrict the access of developing countries’ products to 
developed countries’ markets, reaffirms, in this regard, that developing countries 
should play an increasing role in the formulation of, inter alia, safety, environment 
and health standards, and recognizes the need to facilitate the increased and 
meaningful participation of the developing countries in the work of relevant 
international standard-setting organizations; 

 10. Recognizes that South-South trade should be enhanced and further 
market access should continue to stimulate South-South trade;

effective and faithful application of the World Trade Organization guidelines on 
accession by the least developed countries;  

 14. Emphasizes the need for further work to foster greater coherence between 
the multilateral trading system and the international financial system, and invites the 
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, in fulfilment of its mandate, 
to undertake the relevant policy analysis in those areas and to operationalize such 
work, including through its technical assistance activities;  

 15. Invites donors and beneficiary countries to implement the 
recommendations of the Task Force established by the Director General of the 
World Trade Organization on the Aid for Trade Initiative, which aims to support 
developing and least developed countries to build their supply and export capacities, 
including infrastructure and institutions development, and the need to increase their 
exports, and stresses in this regard the urgent need for its effective 
operationalization with sufficient additional, non-conditional and predictable 
funding;

Integrated Framework for Trade-related Technical Assistance to Least Developed

enable it to enhance its contribution in its three major pillars, namely, consensus-
building, research and policy analysis, and technical assistance, especially through 
increased core resources of the Conference;
