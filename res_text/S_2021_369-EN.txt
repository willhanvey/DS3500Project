  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 

draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling the arms embargo, travel ban, assets freeze and measures concerning 

illicit oil exports which were imposed and modified by resolutions 1970 (2011) and 

2146 (2014), and modified by subsequent resolutions including resolutions 2441 

(2018), 2509 (2020) and 2526 (2020), and that the mandate of the Panel of Experts 

established by paragraph 24 of resolution 1973 (2011) and modified by subsequent 

resolutions was extended until 15 May 2021 by resolution 2509 (2020), 

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial 

integrity and national unity of Libya,  

 Recalling its Presidential Statement of 12 March 2021, which welcomed the 

vote of confidence by the Libyan House of Representatives to endorse the cabinet of 

the interim Government of National Unity charged with leading the country up to 

elections on 24 December 2021 and stressed the importance of this step in the Libyan 

political process, 

 Renewing its request that all Member States support fully the efforts of the 

Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, and its call on Member States to use their 

influence with the parties to implement the ceasefire and support the Libyan-led and 

Libyan owned inclusive political process,  

 Calling for Member States to implement fully the existing measures and to 

report violations to the United Nations Sanctions Committee, and recalling in that 

regard that individuals or entities engaging in, or providing support for, acts that 

threaten the peace, stability or security of Libya may be designated for targeted 

sanctions, 

 Reaffirming that all parties must comply with their obligations under 

international humanitarian law and international human rights law, as applicable, and 

emphasising the importance of holding accountable those responsible for violations 

or abuses of human rights or violations of international humanitarian law, including 

those involved in attacks targeting civilians, 

 Expressing its concern that the illicit export of petroleum, including crude oil 

and refined petroleum products, from Libya undermines the Government of Libya 

and National Oil Corporation and poses a threat to the peace, security and stability of 

Libya, and noting with concern the reports of the illicit import of petroleum, including 

crude oil and refined petroleum products to Libya,

 Recalling that providing support for armed groups or criminal networks through 

the illicit exploitation of crude oil or any other natural resources in Libya may 

constitute acts that threaten the peace, stability and security of Libya,  

 Further reiterating its concern about activities which could damage the integrity 

and unity of Libyan State financial institutions and the National Oil Corporation, and 

stressing the need for the unification of Libya’s institutions, and, in this regard, 

calling on Member States to cease support to and official contact with parallel 

institutions outside of the authority of the Government of Libya, 

 Recalling that international law, as reflected in the United Nations Convention 

on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982, sets out the legal framework applicable 

to activities in the oceans and seas,  

 Further recalling resolutions 2292 (2016), 2357 (2017), 2420 (2018), 2473 

(2019) and 2526 (2020) which in relation to the implementation of the arms embargo 

authorise, for the period of time specified by those resolutions, the inspection on the 

high seas off the coast of Libya of vessels bound to or from Libya believed to be 

carrying arms or related materiel in violation of relevant Security Council resolutions, 

and the seizure and disposal of such items provided that Member States make good 

faith efforts to first obtain the consent of the vessel’s flag State prior to any 

inspections while acting in accordance with those resolutions,  

 Determining that the situation in Libya continues to constitute a threat to 

international peace and security, 

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 

  Prevention of Illicit Exports of Petroleum, including Crude Oil and Refined 

Petroleum Products

in resolution 2146 (2014), as amended by paragraph 2 of resolutions 2441 (2018) and

 3. Requests the Government of Libya to notify the Committee of its focal 

point responsible for communication with the Committee with respect to the measures 

in resolution 2146 (2014), further requests that the Government of Libya’s focal point 

informs the Committee of any vessels transporting petroleum, including crude oil and 

refined petroleum products, illicitly exported from Libya, urges the Government of 

Libya to work closely with the National Oil Corporation in that regard, and to provide 

the Committee with regular updates on ports, oil fields, and installations that are under 

its control, and to inform the Committee about the mechanism used to certify legal 

exports of petroleum, including crude oil and refined petroleum products, and 

requests that the Panel of Experts closely follow and report to the Committee any 

information relating to the illicit export from or illicit import to Libya of petroleum, 

including crude oil and refined petroleum products;  

 4. Calls on the Government of Libya, on the basis of any information 

regarding such exports or attempted exports, to expeditiously contact the concerned 

vessel’s flag State, in the first instance, to resolve the issue and directs the Committee 

to immediately inform all relevant Member States about notifications to the Committee 

from the Government of Libya’s focal point regarding vessels transporting petroleum,

 8. Calls on Member States, particularly those in which designated

the measures are suspected to be present, to report to the Committee on the actions 

they have taken to implement effectively the travel ban and asset freeze measures in 

relation to all individuals on the sanctions list;  

 9. Reiterates that all States shall take the necessary measures to prevent entry

resolution 2213 (2015), 11 of resolution 2362 (2017) and 11 of resolution 2441 (2018) 

and calls upon the Government of Libya to enhance cooperation and information 

sharing with other States in this regard;  

 10. Reaffirms its intention to ensure that assets frozen pursuant to paragraph 

17 of resolution 1970 (2011) shall at a later stage be made available to and for the
