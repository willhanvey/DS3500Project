Agenda item 34 (b)
Oceans and the law of the sea

Australia, Barbados, Canada, Fiji, Marshall Islands, Micronesia (Federated
States of), Namibia, Nauru, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Philippines,
Samoa, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Tonga and United States of America:
draft resolution

Large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing, unauthorized fishing in zones
of national jurisdiction and on the high seas, fisheries by-catch
and discards, and other developments

The General Assembly,

Reaffirming its resolutions 46/215 of 20 December 1991, 49/116 and 49/118 of
19 December 1994, 50/25 of 5 December 1995, 51/36 of 9 December 1996, 52/29 of
26 November 1997 and 53/33 of 24 November 1998, as well as other resolutions on
large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing, unauthorized fishing in zones of national
jurisdiction and on the high seas, fisheries by-catch and discards, and other
developments,

Welcoming the Rome Declaration on the Implementation of the Code of
Conduct for Responsible Fisheries adopted by the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations Ministerial Meeting on Fisheries in March 1999,

Noting that the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries sets out principles
and global standards of behaviour for responsible practices to conserve, manage and
develop fisheries, including guidelines for fishing on the high seas and in areas
under the national jurisdiction of other States, and on fishing gear selectivity and
practices, with the aim of reducing by-catch and discards,

Recognizing that coordination and cooperation at the global, regional,
subregional as well as national levels in the areas, inter alia, of data collection,
information-sharing, capacity-building and training are crucial for the conservation,
management and sustainable development of marine living resources,

Noting the conclusion of negotiations to establish new regional organizations
and arrangements in several heretofore unmanaged fisheries, in particular the
Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks
in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean and the Convention on the Conservation



2

A/55/L.11

and Management of Fishery Resources in the South-east Atlantic Ocean, and
highlighting that these agreements were concluded pursuant to the Agreement for
the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law
of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of
Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks,1

Noting also the adoption by the States members of the Permanent Commission
for the South-east Pacific of the Framework Agreement for the Conservation of
Living Marine Resources in High Seas of the South-east Pacific,

Recognizing the importance of the Agreement for the Implementation of the
Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December
1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and
Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and the Agreement to Promote Compliance with
International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the
High Seas, and noting with concern that neither of these agreements has yet entered
into force,

Noting with satisfaction that the Committee on Fisheries of the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in February 1999 adopted
international plans of action for the management of fishing capacity, for reducing
the incidental catch of seabirds in longline fisheries and for the conservation and
management of sharks,

Taking note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General,2 and
emphasizing the useful role that the report plays in bringing together information
relating to the sustainable development of the world’s marine living resources
provided by States, relevant international organizations, regional and subregional
fisheries organizations and non-governmental organizations,

Noting with satisfaction that, while significant work remains to be done,
interested parties have made real progress towards sustainable fisheries
management,

Noting that while there has been generally a marked decrease in the reporting
of large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing activities in most regions of the world’s
oceans and seas, large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing remains a threat to marine
living resources in some areas,3

Expressing its continuing concern that efforts should be made to ensure that
the implementation of resolution 46/215 in some parts of the world does not result in
the transfer to other parts of the world of drift-nets that contravene the resolution,

Noting with concern that unauthorized fishing in zones of national jurisdiction
and on the high seas/illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing remains as one of
the most severe problems currently affecting world fisheries and the sustainability of
living marine resources, and noting also that unauthorized fishing in zones of
national jurisdiction and on the high seas/illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing
has a detrimental impact on the food security and the economies of many States,
particularly developing States,

A/55/L.11

Noting the significance of the work being undertaken under the aegis of the
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to develop a
comprehensive international plan of action to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal,
unreported and unregulated fishing, involving consideration of the range of
possibilities for action in accordance with international law, and acknowledging the
work done by certain regional fisheries organizations,

Welcoming the efforts in the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations to address the causes of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, through
a comprehensive and integrated approach, involving all relevant States and regional
and subregional fisheries management organizations and arrangements, to the
deterrence of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing which encourages all States
to take, to the greatest extent possible, measures or to cooperate to ensure that their
nationals, in accordance with article 117 of the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea,4 and vessels flying their flag do not support or engage in illegal,
unreported and unregulated fishing,

Welcoming also the cooperation being undertaken with the International
Labour Organization and other relevant international organizations in the joint Ad
Hoc Working Group on combating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing of the
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the International
Maritime Organization,

Recognizing the need for the International Maritime Organization, the Food
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and regional and subregional
fisheries management organizations and arrangements to address the issue of marine
debris derived from land-based and ship-generated sources of pollution, including
derelict fishing gear, which can cause mortality and habitat destruction of living
marine resources,

Expressing concern at the significant level of by-catch and discards in several
of the world’s commercial fisheries, and recognizing that the development and use
of selective, environmentally safe and cost-effective fishing gear and techniques will
be important for reducing by-catch and discards,

Expressing concern also at the reports of continued loss of seabirds,
particularly albatross, as a result of incidental mortality from longline fishing
operations, and the loss of other marine species, including sharks and fin-fish
species, as a result of incidental mortality, and noting the recent initiative to develop
a convention for the protection of southern hemisphere albatrosses and petrels,

1. Reaffirms the importance it attaches to the long-term conservation,
management and sustainable use of the marine living resources of the world’s
oceans and seas and the obligations of States to cooperate to this end, in accordance
with international law, as reflected in the relevant provisions of the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea,4 in particular the provisions on cooperation set
out in part V and part VII, section 2, of the Convention regarding straddling stocks,
highly migratory species, marine mammals, anadromous stocks and marine living
resources of the high seas;

subregional fisheries organizations and arrangements, the international plans of
action of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations for reducing
the incidental take of seabirds in longline fisheries, for the conservation and
management of sharks and for the management of fishing capacity, since the state of
progress in the implementation of all three plans will be reported to the Committee
on Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations at the
twenty-fourth session of the Committee, to be held from 26 February to 2 March
2001;

4. Takes note with satisfaction of the activities of the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations aimed at providing assistance to developing
countries in upgrading their capabilities in monitoring, control and surveillance,
through its Inter-regional Programme of Assistance to Developing Countries for the
Implementation of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries;

5. Also takes note with satisfaction of the activities of the Food and

(b), of the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the
Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish
Stocks1 that have not done so to ratify or accede to it and to consider applying it
provisionally;

9. Calls upon States and other entities referred to in article 10, paragraph 1,
of the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and
Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas that have not deposited
instruments of acceptance of the Agreement to do so;



5

A/55/L.11

10. Recalls that Agenda 21, adopted at the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development, calls upon States to take effective action, consistent
with international law, to deter reflagging of vessels by their nationals as a means of
avoiding compliance with applicable conservation and management measures for
fishing vessels on the high seas,

11. Calls upon States that have not done so to take measures to deter
reflagging of fishing vessels flying their flag to avoid compliance with applicable
obligations and to ensure that fishing vessels entitled to fly their flag do not fish in
areas under the national jurisdiction of other States unless duly authorized by the
authorities of the States concerned and in accordance with the conditions set out in
the authorization, and that they do not fish on the high seas in contravention of the
applicable conservation and management measures;

12. Urges States to continue the development of an international plan of
action on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing for the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations, as a matter of priority, so that its Committee on
Fisheries can be in a position to adopt elements for inclusion in a comprehensive
and effective plan of action at its twenty-fourth session, to be held from 26 February
to 2 March 2001;

A/55/L.11

and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, and
other relevant principles of international law;

19. Affirms also the central role that regional and subregional fisheries
management organizations and arrangements have in intergovernmental cooperation
to assess living marine resources within their competence, to manage their
conservation and sustainable use and thus to promote food security and sustain the
economic base of many States and communities, and further affirms that they also
will play a key role in implementing applicable international law, including, as
appropriate, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Fish Stocks
Agreement and the Compliance Agreement, and in promoting the application of the
Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries;

20. Calls upon the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,
the International Maritime Organization, regional and subregional fisheries
management organizations and arrangements and other appropriate
intergovernmental organizations to take up, as a matter of priority, the issue of
marine debris as it relates to fisheries and, where appropriate to promote better
coordination and help States to fully implement relevant international agreements,
including annex 5 and the Guidelines of the International Convention for the
Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978
