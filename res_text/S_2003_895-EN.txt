Draft resolution

The Security Council,

Recalling its previous resolutions and the statements of its President
concerning the situation in Sierra Leone,

Affirming the commitment of all States to respect the sovereignty, political
independence and territorial integrity of Sierra Leone,

Welcoming the increasingly stable security situation in Sierra Leone, while
encouraging further progress towards strengthening the capacity of the Sierra Leone
Police and armed forces to maintain security and stability independently,

Noting that lasting stability in Sierra Leone will depend on peace in the
subregion, especially in Liberia, and emphasizing the importance of cooperation
among the countries of the subregion to this end, as well as the need for
coordination of United Nations efforts to contribute to the consolidation of peace
and security in the subregion,

Reiterating the importance of the effective consolidation of stability and State
authority throughout Sierra Leone, particularly in the diamond fields, the
reintegration of ex-combatants, voluntary and unhindered return of refugees and
internally displaced persons, and full respect for human rights and the rule of law,
paying special attention to the protection of women and children, and stressing
continued United Nations support to the Government of Sierra Leone in fulfilling
these objectives,

Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 5 September 2003
(S/2003/863),

(UNAMSIL) shall be extended for a period of six months from 30 September 2003;

intention to continue with these adjustments, as outlined in paragraph 10 of his
report;

S/2003/895

4. Emphasizes that the development of the administrative capacities of the
Government of Sierra Leone, particularly an effective and sustainable police force,

development, and urges the Government of Sierra Leone, with the assistance of
donors and UNAMSIL, in accordance with its mandate, to accelerate the
consolidation of civil authority and public services throughout the country, and to
continue to strengthen the operational effectiveness and capabilities of the security
sector;

control over, and regulation of, diamond mining, including through the High Level
Steering Committee, and encourages member States to volunteer candidates for the
post of diamond mining police adviser;

6. Notes with serious concern the precarious financial situation of the
Special Court for Sierra Leone, reiterates its appeal to States to contribute
generously to the Court, as requested in the Secretary-General’s letter of 18 March
2003, and urges all States to cooperate fully with the Court;

7. Commends the Truth and Reconciliation Commission for its work,
encourages states to contribute generously to it and welcomes the intention of the

encourages the Presidents of the Mano River Union member States to resume
dialogue and to implement their commitments to building regional peace and
security;

9. Welcomes the deployment of ECOWAS forces to Liberia, supported by
UNAMSIL, reiterates its demand that armed groups in Liberia refrain from illegal
incursions into Sierra Leone, and encourages the Sierra Leonean armed forces,
together with UNAMSIL, to maintain intensive patrolling of the border with
Liberia;

10. Encourages the continued support of UNAMSIL, within its capabilities
and areas of deployment, for the voluntary return of refugees and displaced persons;

11. Welcomes the Secretary-General’s intention to keep the security, political,
humanitarian and human rights situation in Sierra Leone under close review and to
report to the Council, after due consultations with troop-contributing countries and
the Government of Sierra Leone, with any additional recommendations;

12. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
