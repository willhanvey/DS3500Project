  Jerusalem 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 181 (II) of 29 November 1947, in particular its 
provisions regarding the City of Jerusalem,  

 Recalling also its resolution 36/120 E of 10 December 1981 and all its 
subsequent relevant resolutions, including resolution 56/31 of 3 December 2001, in 
which it, inter alia, determined that all legislative and administrative measures and 
actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purported to 
alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem, in particular the 
so-called “Basic Law” on Jerusalem and the proclamation of Jerusalem as the 
capital of Israel, were null and void and must be rescinded forthwith,  

 Recalling further the Security Council resolutions relevant to Jerusalem, 
including resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980, in which the Council, inter alia, 
decided not to recognize the “Basic Law” on Jerusalem,  

 Recalling the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International 
Court of Justice on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory,1 and recalling its resolution ES-10/15 of 20 July 
2004,  

 Expressing its grave concern about any action taken by any body, 
governmental or non-governmental, in violation of the above-mentioned resolutions,

 Expressing its grave concern also, in particular, about the continuation by 
Israel, the occupying Power, of illegal settlement activities, including the so-called 
E-1 plan, its construction of the wall in and around East Jerusalem, its restrictions 
on access to and residence in East Jerusalem and the further isolation of the city 
from the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which are having a detrimental 
effect on the lives of Palestinians and could prejudge a final status agreement on 
Jerusalem,  

 Expressing its grave concern further about the continuing Israeli demolition of 
Palestinian homes, the revocation of residency rights and the eviction and 
displacement of numerous Palestinian families from East Jerusalem neighbourhoods, 
as well as other acts of provocation and incitement, including by Israeli settlers, in 
the city,  

 Expressing its concern about the Israeli excavations undertaken in the Old City 
of Jerusalem, including in and around religious sites,  

 Reaffirming that the international community, through the United Nations, has 
a legitimate interest in the question of the City of Jerusalem and in the protection of 
the unique spiritual, religious and cultural dimensions of the city, as foreseen in 
relevant United Nations resolutions on this matter,  

 Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in the 
Middle East,2  

 1. Reiterates its determination that any actions taken by Israel, the 
occupying Power, to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the Holy 
City of Jerusalem are illegal and therefore null and void and have no validity 
whatsoever, and calls upon Israel to immediately cease all such illegal and unilateral 
measures;  

 2. Stresses that a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the question of 
the City of Jerusalem should take into account the legitimate concerns of both the 
Palestinian and Israeli sides and should include internationally guaranteed 
provisions to ensure the freedom of religion and of conscience of its inhabitants, as 
well as permanent, free and unhindered access to the holy places by the people of all 
religions and nationalities;  

 3. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its 
sixty-seventh session on the implementation of the present resolution.
