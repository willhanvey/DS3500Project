 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming its resolutions 1540 (2004) of 28 April 2004, 1673 (2006) of 
27 April 2006 and 1810 (2008) of 25 April 2008, 

 Reaffirming that the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, 
as well as their means of delivery, constitutes a threat to international peace and 
security, 

 Reaffirming the need for all Member States to comply fully with their 
obligations and fulfil their commitments in relation to arms control, disarmament 
and non-proliferation in all its aspects of all weapons of mass destruction and their 
means of delivery, 

 Reaffirming that prevention of proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological 
weapons should not hamper international cooperation in materials, equipment and 
technology for peaceful purposes while goals of peaceful utilization should not be 
misused for proliferation purposes, 

 Remaining gravely concerned by the threat of terrorism and the risk that non 
state actors may acquire, develop, traffic in or use nuclear, chemical, and biological 
weapons and their means of delivery, 

 Reaffirming its resolve to take appropriate and effective actions against any 
threat to international peace and security caused by the proliferation of nuclear, 
chemical and biological weapons and their means of delivery, in conformity with its 
primary responsibilities, as provided for in the United Nations Charter, 

 Reaffirming its decision that none of the obligations in resolution 1540 (2004) 
shall be interpreted so as to conflict with or alter the rights and obligations of State 
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Chemical 
Weapons Convention and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention or alter the 
responsibilities of the International Atomic Energy Agency or the Organization for 
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, 

 Noting that international cooperation between States, in accordance with 
international law, is required to counter the illicit trafficking by non-State actors in 



S/2011/257

nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, their means of delivery and related 
materials, 

 Recognizing the need to enhance coordination of efforts at national, regional, 
subregional and international levels, as appropriate, in order to strengthen a global 
response to the serious challenge and threat to international peace and security 
posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of 
delivery, 

 Emphasizing the need for States to take all appropriate national measures in 
accordance with their national authorities and legislation, and consistent with 
international law, to strengthen export controls, to control access to intangible 
transfers of technology and to information that could be used for weapons of mass 
destruction and their means of delivery, to prevent proliferation financing and 
shipments, and to secure sensitive materials, 

 Endorsing the work already carried out by the Committee established pursuant 
to resolution 1540 (2004), hereafter the 1540 Committee, in accordance with its 
programmes of work, including the establishment of the working groups for

 Taking note of international efforts towards full implementation of resolution 
1540 (2004), including on preventing the financing of proliferation-related

Financial Action Task Force (FATF), 

 Noting that not all States have presented to the 1540 Committee their national 
reports on implementation of resolution 1540 (2004), 

 Further noting that the full implementation of resolution 1540 (2004) by all 
States, including the adoption of national laws and measures to ensure 
implementation of these laws, is a long-term task that will require continuous efforts 
at national, regional and international levels, 

 Recognizing, in that regard, the importance of dialogue between the 1540 
Committee and Member States and stressing that direct contact is an effective means 
of such dialogue, 

 Recognizing that many States continue to require assistance in implementing 
resolution 1540 (2004), emphasizing the importance of providing States, in response 
to their requests, with effective assistance that meets their needs, and welcoming the 
coordinating and facilitating role of the 1540 Committee in this regard, 

 Stressing, in that regard, the need of enhanced assistance and collaboration 
among States, between the 1540 Committee and States, and between the 1540 
Committee and relevant international, regional and subregional organizations in 
assisting States to implement resolution 1540 (2004),
