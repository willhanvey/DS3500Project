 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming that terrorism in all forms and manifestations constitutes one of 

the most serious threats to international peace and security and that any acts of 

terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivations, whenever 

and by whomsoever committed, and remaining determined to contribute further to 

enhancing the effectiveness of the overall effort to fight this scourge on a global 

level, 

 Noting with concern that the terrorism threat has become more diffuse, with an 

increase, in various regions of the world, of terrorist acts including those motivated 

by intolerance or extremism, and expressing its determination to combat this threat,  

 Bearing in mind the need to address the conditions conducive to the spread of 

terrorism, and affirming Member States’ determination to continue to do all  they can 

to resolve conflict and to deny terrorist groups the ability to put down roots and 

establish safe havens to address better the growing threat posed by terrorism,  



S/2014/688 
 

 

14-61604 2/8 

 

 Emphasizing that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any 

religion, nationality or civilization,  

 Recognizing that international cooperation and any measures taken by Member 

States to prevent and combat terrorism must comply fully with the Charter of the 

United Nations, 

 Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political 

independence of all States in accordance with the Charter,  

 Reaffirming that Member States must ensure that any measures taken to 

counter terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, in 

particular international human rights law, international refugee law, and 

international humanitarian law, underscoring that respect for human rights, 

fundamental freedoms and the rule of law are complementary and mutually 

reinforcing with effective counter-terrorism measures, and are an essential part of a 

successful counter-terrorism effort and notes the importance of respect for the rule 

of law so as to effectively prevent and combat terrorism, and noting that failure to 

comply with these and other international obligations, including under the Charter 

of the United Nations, is one of the factors contributing to increased radicalization 

and fosters a sense of impunity,  

 Expressing grave concern over the acute and growing threat posed by foreign 

terrorist fighters, namely individuals who travel to a State other than their States of 

residence or nationality for the purpose of the perpetration, planning, or preparation 

of, or participation in, terrorist acts or the providing or receiving of terrorist 

training, including in connection with armed conflict, and resolving to address this 

threat,  

 Expressing grave concern about those who attempt to travel to become foreign 

terrorist fighters, 

 Concerned that foreign terrorist fighters increase the intensity, duration and 

intractability of conflicts, and also may pose a serious threat to their States of origin, 

the States they transit and the States to which they travel, as well as States 

neighbouring zones of armed conflict in which foreign terrorist fighters are active 

and that are affected by serious security burdens, and noting that the threat of 

foreign terrorist fighters may affect all regions and Member States, even those far 

from conflict zones, and expressing grave concern that foreign terrorist fighters are 

using their extremist ideology to promote terrorism,  

 Expressing concern that international networks have been established by 

terrorists and terrorist entities among States of origin, transit and destination 

through which foreign terrorist fighters and the resources to support them have been 

channelled back and forth, 

 Expressing particular concern that foreign terrorist fighters are being recruited 

by and are joining entities such as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), 

the Al-Nusrah Front (ANF) and other cells, affiliates, splinter groups or derivatives 

of Al-Qaida, as designated by the Committee established pursuant to resolutions 

1267 (1999) and 1989 (2011), recognizing that the foreign terrorist fighter threat 

includes, among others, individuals supporting acts or activities of Al -Qaida and its 

cells, affiliates, splinter groups, and derivative entities, including by recruiting for

or otherwise supporting acts or activities of such entities, and stressing the urgent 

need to address this particular threat,  

 Recognizing that addressing the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters 

requires comprehensively addressing underlying factors, including by prevent ing 

radicalization to terrorism, stemming recruitment, inhibiting foreign terrorist fighter 

travel, disrupting financial support to foreign terrorist fighters, countering violent 

extremism, which can be conducive to terrorism, countering incitement to terrorist 

acts motivated by extremism or intolerance, promoting political and religious 

tolerance, economic development and social cohesion and inclusiveness, ending and 

resolving armed conflicts, and facilitating reintegration and rehabilitation,  

 Recognizing also that terrorism will not be defeated by military force, law 

enforcement measures, and intelligence operations alone, and underlining the need 

to address the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism, as outlined in Pillar I 

of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (A/RES/60/288),  

 Expressing concern over the increased use by terrorists and their supporters of 

communications technology for the purpose of radicalizing to terrorism, rec ruiting 

and inciting others to commit terrorist acts, including through the internet, and 

financing and facilitating the travel and subsequent activities of foreign terrorist 

fighters, and underlining the need for Member States to act cooperatively to prevent 

terrorists from exploiting technology, communications and resources to incite 

support for terrorist acts, while respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms 

and in compliance with other obligations under international law,  

 Noting with appreciation the activities undertaken in the area of capacity 

building by United Nations entities, in particular entities of the Counter-Terrorism 

Implementation Task Force (CTITF), including the United Nations Office of Drugs 

and Crime (UNODC) and the United Nations Centre for Counter-Terrorism 

(UNCCT), and also the efforts of the Counter Terrorism Committee Executive 

Directorate (CTED) to facilitate technical assistance, specifically by promoting 

engagement between providers of capacity-building assistance and recipients, in 

coordination with other relevant international, regional and subregional 

organizations, to assist Member States, upon their request, in implementation of the 

United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy,  

 Noting recent developments and initiatives at the international, regional and 

subregional levels to prevent and suppress international terrorism, and noting the 

work of the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF), in particular its recent 

adoption of a comprehensive set of good practices to address the foreign terrorist 

fighter phenomenon, and its publication of several other framework documents and 

good practices, including in the areas of countering violent extremism, criminal 

justice, prisons, kidnapping for ransom, providing support to vict ims of terrorism, 

and community-oriented policing, to assist interested States with the practical 

implementation of the United Nations counter-terrorism legal and policy framework 

and to complement the work of the relevant United Nations counter-terrorism 

entities in these areas,  

 Noting with appreciation the efforts of INTERPOL to address the threat posed 

by foreign terrorist fighters, including through global law enforcement information 

sharing enabled by the use of its secure communications network, databases, and 

system of advisory notices, procedures to track stolen, forged identity papers and

travel documents, and INTERPOL’s counter-terrorism fora and foreign terrorist 

fighter programme,  

 Having regard to and highlighting  the situation of individuals of more than 

one nationality who travel to their states of nationality for the purpose of the 

perpetration, planning, preparation of, or participation in, terrorist acts or the 

providing or receiving of terrorist training, and urging States to take action, as 

appropriate, in compliance with their obligations under their domestic law and 

international law, including international human rights law,  

 Calling upon States to ensure, in conformity with international law, in 

particular international human rights law and international refugee law, that refugee 

status is not abused by the perpetrators, organizers or facilitators of terrorist acts, 

including by foreign terrorist fighters,  

 Reaffirming its call upon all States to become party to the international 

counter-terrorism conventions and protocols as soon as possible, whether or not they 

are a party to regional conventions on the matter, and to fully implement their 

obligations under those to which they are a party,  

 Noting the continued threat to international peace and security posed by 

terrorism, and affirming the need to combat by all means, in accordance with the 

Charter of the United Nations, threats to international peace and security caused by 

terrorist acts, including those perpetrated by foreign terrorist fighters,  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 1. Condemns the violent extremism, which can be conducive to terrorism, 

sectarian violence, and the commission of terrorist acts by foreign terrorist fighters, 

and demands that all foreign terrorist fighters disarm and cease all terrorist acts and 

participation in armed conflict; 

 2. Reaffirms that all States shall prevent the movement of terrorists or 

terrorist groups by effective border controls and controls on issuance of i dentity 

papers and travel documents, and through measures for preventing counterfeiting, 

forgery or fraudulent use of identity papers and travel documents, underscores, in 

this regard, the importance of addressing, in accordance with their relevant 

international obligations, the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters, and 

encourages Member States to employ evidence-based traveller risk assessment and 

screening procedures including collection and analysis of travel data, without 

resorting to profiling based on stereotypes founded on grounds of discrimination 

prohibited by international law;  

 3. Urges Member States, in accordance with domestic and international law, 

to intensify and accelerate the exchange of operational information regarding 

actions or movements of terrorists or terrorist networks, including foreign terrorist 

fighters, especially with their States of residence or nationality, through bilateral or 

multilateral mechanisms, in particular the United Nations;  

 4. Calls upon all Member States, in accordance with their obligations under 

international law, to cooperate in efforts to address the threat posed by foreign 

terrorist fighters, including by preventing the radicalization to terrorism and 

recruitment of foreign terrorist fighters, including children, preventing foreign 

terrorist fighters from crossing their borders, disrupting and preventing financial 



 
S/2014/688

support to foreign terrorist fighters, and developing and implementing prosecution, 

rehabilitation and reintegration strategies for returning foreign terrorist fighters; 

 5. Decides that Member States shall, consistent with international human 

rights law, international refugee law, and international humanitarian law, prevent 

and suppress the recruiting, organizing, transporting or equipping of  individuals 

who travel to a State other than their States of residence or nationality for the 

purpose of the perpetration, planning, or preparation of, or participation in, terrorist 

acts or the providing or receiving of terrorist training, and the financ ing of their 

travel and of their activities; 

 6. Recalls its decision, in resolution 1373 (2001), that all Member States 

shall ensure that any person who participates in the financing, planning, preparati on 

or perpetration of terrorist acts or in supporting terrorist acts is brought to justice, 

and decides that all States shall ensure that their domestic laws and regulations 

establish serious criminal offenses sufficient to provide the ability to prosecute  and 

to penalize in a manner duly reflecting the seriousness of the offense:  

 (a) their nationals who travel or attempt to travel to a State other than their 

States of residence or nationality, and other individuals who travel or attempt to 

travel from their territories to a State other than their States of residence or 

nationality, for the purpose of the perpetration, planning, or preparation of, or 

participation in, terrorist acts, or the providing or receiving of terrorist training;  

 (b) the wilful provision or collection, by any means, directly or indirectly, of 

funds by their nationals or in their territories with the intention that the funds should

  International Cooperation  
 

 11. Calls upon Member States to improve international, regional, and 

subregional cooperation, if appropriate through bilateral agreements, to prevent the 

travel of foreign terrorist fighters from or through their territories, including through 

increased sharing of information for the purpose of identifying foreign terrorist 

fighters, the sharing and adoption of best practices, and improved understanding of 

the patterns of travel by foreign terrorist fighters, and for Member States to act 

cooperatively when taking national measures to prevent terrorists from exploiting 

technology, communications and resources to incite support for terrorist acts, while 

respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms and in compliance with other 

obligations under international law;

welcomes and encourages bilateral assistance by Member States to help build such 

national capacity; 

 

  Countering Violent Extremism in Order to Prevent Terrorism 
 

 15. Underscores that countering violent extremism, which can be conducive 

to terrorism, including preventing radicalization, recruitment, and mobilization of 

individuals into terrorist groups and becoming foreign terrorist fighters is an 

essential element of addressing the threat to international peace and security posed 

by foreign terrorist fighters, and calls upon Member States to enhance efforts to 

counter this kind of violent extremism; 

 16. Encourages Member States to engage relevant local communities and 

non-governmental actors in developing strategies to counter the violent extremist 

narrative that can incite terrorist acts, address the conditions conducive to the spread 

of violent extremism, which can be conducive to terrorism, including by 

empowering youth, families, women, religious, cultural and education leaders, and 

all other concerned groups of civil society and adopt tailored approaches to 

countering recruitment to this kind of violent extremism and promoting social 

inclusion and cohesion;  

 17. Recalls its decision in paragraph 14 of resolution 2161 (2014) with 

respect to improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and individuals, groups, 

undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, and urges Member States, in 

this context, to act cooperatively when taking national measures to prevent terrorists 

from exploiting technology, communications and resources, including audio and 

video, to incite support for terrorist acts, while respecting human rights and 

fundamental freedoms and in compliance with other obligations under international 

law; 

 18. Calls upon Member States to cooperate and consistently support each 

other’s efforts to counter violent extremism, which can be conducive to terrorism, 

including through capacity building, coordination of plans and efforts, and sharing 

lessons learned; 

 19. Emphasizes in this regard the importance of Member States’ efforts to 

develop non-violent alternative avenues for conflict prevention and resolution by 

affected individuals and local communities to decrease the risk of radicalization to 

terrorism, and of efforts to promote peaceful alternatives to violent narratives 

espoused by foreign terrorist fighters, and underscores the role education can play 

in countering terrorist narratives; 

 

  United Nations Engagement on the Foreign Terrorist Fighter Threat  
 

 20. Notes that foreign terrorist fighters and those who finance or otherwise 

facilitate their travel and subsequent activities may be eligible for inclusion on the 

Al-Qaida Sanctions List maintained by the Committee pursuant to resolutions 1267 

(1999) and 1989 (2011) where they participate in the financing, planning, 

facilitating, preparing, or perpetrating of acts or activities by, in conjunction with, 

under the name of, on behalf of, or in support of, Al-Qaida, supplying, selling or 

transferring arms and related materiel to, or recruiting for, or otherwise supporting 

acts or activities of Al-Qaida or any cell, affiliate, splinter group or derivative 

thereof, and calls upon States to propose such foreign terrorist fighters and those

who facilitate or finance their travel and subsequent activities for possible 

designation;  

 21. Directs the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999) 

and 1989 (2011) and the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, in 

close cooperation with all relevant United Nations counter-terrorism bodies, in 

particular CTED, to devote special focus to the threat posed by foreign terrorist 

fighters recruited by or joining ISIL, ANF and all groups, undertakings and entities 

associated with Al-Qaida; 

 22. Encourages the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team to 

coordinate its efforts to monitor and respond to the threat posed by foreign terrorist 

fighters with other United Nations counter-terrorism bodies, in particular the 

CTITF;  

 23. Requests the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, in close 

cooperation with other United Nations counter-terrorism bodies, to report to the 

Committee established pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999) and 1989 (2011) within 

180 days, and provide a preliminary oral update to the Committee within 60 days, 

on the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters recruited by or joining ISIL, ANF 

and all groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, including: 

 (a) a comprehensive assessment of the threat posed by these foreign terrorist 

fighters, including their facilitators, the most affected regions and trends in 

radicalization to terrorism, facilitation, recruitment, demographics, and financing; and  

 (b) recommendations for actions that can be taken to enhance the response to 

the threat posed by these foreign terrorist fighters;  

 24. Requests the Counter-Terrorism Committee, within its existing mandate 

and with the support of CTED, to identify principal gaps in Member States’ 

capacities to implement Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1624 (2005) 

that may hinder States’ abilities to stem the flow of foreign terrorist fighters, as well 

as to identify good practices to stem the flow of foreign terrorist fighters in the 

implementation of resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1624 (2005), and to facilitate 

technical assistance, specifically by promoting engagement between providers of 

capacity-building assistance and recipients, especially those in the most affected 

regions, including through the development, upon their request, of comprehensive 

counter-terrorism strategies that encompass countering violent radicalization and the 

flow of foreign terrorist fighters, recalling the roles of other relevant actors, for 

example the Global Counterterrorism Forum;  

 25. Underlines that the increasing threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters is 

part of the emerging issues, trends and developments related to resolutions 1373 

(2001) and 1624 (2005), that, in paragraph 5 of resolution 2129 (2013), the Security 

Council directed CTED to identify, and therefore merits close attention by the 

Counter-Terrorism Committee, consistent with its mandate;  

 26. Requests the Committee established pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999) 

and 1989 (2011) and the Counter-Terrorism Committee to update the Security 

Council on their respective efforts pursuant to this resolution;  

 27. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
