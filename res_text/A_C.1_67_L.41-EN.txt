  Treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 48/75 L of 16 December 1993, 53/77 I of 4 December 
1998, 55/33 Y of 20 November 2000, 56/24 J of 29 November 2001, 57/80 of 
22 November 2002, 58/57 of 8 December 2003, 59/81 of 3 December 2004, 64/29 of 
2 December 2009, 65/65 of 8 December 2010 and 66/44 of 2 December 2011 on the 
subject of banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other 
nuclear explosive devices, 

 Recalling also document CD/1299 of 24 March 1995, in which all members of 
the Conference on Disarmament agreed on the mandate to negotiate a treaty banning 
the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive 
devices and which would not preclude any delegation from raising for 
consideration, in negotiations, any issue noted therein, 

 Mindful of the continuing importance and relevance of the Conference on 
Disarmament, and recalling the past achievements of that body in successfully 
negotiating arms control and disarmament agreements, 

 Recalling the support for the Conference on Disarmament expressed by the 
Security Council summit on nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, 
held on 24 September 2009, as well as similar messages expressed at the high-level 
meeting on revitalizing the work of the Conference on Disarmament and taking 
forward multilateral disarmament negotiations, held in New York on 24 September 
2010, and the follow-up plenary meeting of the General Assembly, held from 27 to 
29 July 2011, 



A/C.1/67/L.41  
 

12-55904 2 
 

 Expressing frustration with the years of stalemate in the Conference on 
Disarmament, and looking forward to it again fulfilling its mandate as the world’s 
single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum, 

 Convinced that a non-discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and 
effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear 
weapons or other nuclear explosive devices would be a significant contribution to 
nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, 

 Recognizing the importance of advancing all issues identified in decision 
CD/1864, adopted by consensus by the Conference on Disarmament on 29 May 
2009, 

 Welcoming the discussions involving scientific experts on various technical 
aspects of a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or 
other nuclear explosive devices that have taken place in Geneva, both within and on 
the margins of the Conference on Disarmament, in support of the early 
commencement of negotiations, including those meetings that took place in 2012 
pursuant to resolution 66/44, 

 Noting the determination expressed by China, France, the Russian Federation, 
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of 
America at the meeting held in Washington, D.C., from 27 to 29 June 2012 to renew 
their efforts, with relevant parties, to achieve a treaty banning the production of 
fissile materials for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices at the 
earliest possible date in the Conference on Disarmament, 

 Noting also that the Conference on Disarmament did not succeed in adopting a 
programme of work by the end of its 2012 session, 

 1. Urges the Conference on Disarmament to agree on and implement early 
in 2013 a balanced and comprehensive programme of work that includes the 
immediate commencement of negotiations on a treaty banning the production of 
fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis 
of document CD/1299 and the mandate contained therein; 

 2. Requests the Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States on a 
treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other 
nuclear explosive devices, including possible elements therein, and to submit a 
report on the subject to the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session;  

 3. Also requests the Secretary-General to establish a group of governmental 
experts with a membership of 25 States chosen on the basis of equitable 
geographical representation, which, taking into account the report containing the 
views of Member States, will make recommendations on possible elements that 
could contribute to a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear 
weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of document CD/1299 and 
the mandate contained therein, which will operate on the basis of consensus, without 
prejudice to national positions in future negotiations and which will meet in Geneva 
for two sessions of two weeks in 2014 and in 2015; 

 4. Calls upon the Secretary-General to transmit the report of the group of 
governmental experts to the General Assembly at its seventieth session and to the 
Conference on Disarmament; 



 A/C.1/67/L.41
 

3 12-55904 
 

 5. Invites the Conference on Disarmament to take note of the report of the 
group of governmental experts and consider further action as appropriate; 

 6. Decides that, should the Conference on Disarmament agree upon and 
implement a balanced and comprehensive programme of work that includes 
negotiation of a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear 
weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, the group of governmental experts will 
conclude and its work will be submitted to the Secretary-General for onward 
transmission to the Conference on Disarmament; 

 7. Also decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-eighth 
session, under the item entitled “General and complete disarmament”, the sub-item 
entitled “Treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or 
other nuclear explosive devices”.
