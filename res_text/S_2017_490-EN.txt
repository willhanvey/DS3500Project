  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 

draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its resolution 1970 (2011) imposing the arms embargo on Libya and 

all its subsequent relevant resolutions,  

 Recalling its resolution 2292 (2016) concerning the strict implementation of 

the arms embargo on the high seas off the coast of Libya,  

 Mindful of its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international 

peace and security under the Charter of the United Nations,  

 Reaffirming its determination that terrorism, in all forms and manifestations, 

constitutes one of the most serious threats to peace and security,  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 1. Decides to extend the authorizations as set out in resolution 2292 for a 

further 12 months from the date of this resolution;  

 2. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Security Council within 

eleven months of the adoption of this resolution on its implementation;  

 3. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
