Recalling also its resolution ES-10/14 of 8 December 2003, in which it

“What are the legal consequences arising from the construction of the
wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian
Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, as described in the report of
the Secretary-General, considering the rules and principles of international
law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention, of 1949, and relevant Security
Council and General Assembly resolutions?”

Having received with respect the Advisory Opinion of the International Court
of Justice on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied
Palestinian Territory,6 rendered on 9 July 2004,

Noting in particular that the Court replied to the question put forth by the
General Assembly in its resolution ES-10/14 as follows:7

“A. The construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power,
in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East
Jerusalem, and its associated regime, are contrary to international law;

“B. Israel is under an obligation to terminate its breaches of international
law; it is under an obligation to cease forthwith the works of construction
of the wall being built in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in
and around East Jerusalem, to dismantle forthwith the structure therein
situated, and to repeal or render ineffective forthwith all legislative and
regulatory acts relating thereto, in accordance with paragraph 151 of this
Opinion;

“C. Israel is under an obligation to make reparation for all damage caused by
the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,
including in and around East Jerusalem;

“D. All States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation
resulting from the construction of the wall and not to render aid or
assistance in maintaining the situation created by such construction; all
States Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection
of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 have in addition
the obligation, while respecting the United Nations Charter and
international law, to ensure compliance by Israel with international
humanitarian law as embodied in that Convention;

“E. The United Nations, and especially the General Assembly and the
Security Council, should consider what further action is required to bring
to an end the illegal situation resulting from the construction of the wall
and the associated regime, taking due account of the present Advisory
Opinion.”
