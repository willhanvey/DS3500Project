 Welcoming the presidential statements adopted by the Security Council on 
11 October 2007,7 

 Welcoming the reports of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
in Myanmar8 and his oral presentations, as well as the agreement by the Government 
of Myanmar to the visit of the Special Rapporteur, for the first time in four years, in 
November 2007 and then again in August 2008 soon after the appointment of the new 
Special Rapporteur, and encouraging the continuation of such visits, welcoming also 
the report of the Secretary-General9 and his designation of a Special Adviser to 
continue to pursue the mandate of good offices, and affirming its full support for this 
mission, 

 Taking note of the cooperation of the Government of Myanmar with the 
international community, including the United Nations, in delivering humanitarian 
assistance to the people affected by Cyclone Nargis despite its initial denial of access, 
which resulted in widespread suffering and increased the risk of loss of lives, and 
calling upon the Government of Myanmar, in the interest of the people of Myanmar, 
to cooperate on humanitarian access in all other areas of the country where the United 
Nations, other international humanitarian organizations and their partners continue to 
experience difficulties in delivering assistance to persons in need, 

 Calling upon the Government of Myanmar to cooperate with the international 
community in order to achieve concrete progress in areas such as human rights and 
political processes leading to a genuine democratic transition through concrete 
measures, 

 Deeply concerned that the urgent calls contained in the above-mentioned 
resolutions, as well as the statements of other United Nations bodies concerning the 
situation of human rights in Myanmar, have not been met, and emphasizing that, 
without significant progress towards meeting these calls of the international 
community, the situation of human rights in Myanmar will continue to deteriorate, 

 1.  Strongly condemns the ongoing systematic violations of civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights of the people of Myanmar, as described in 
resolution 62/222 and the previous resolutions of the General Assembly, the 
Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council;  

 2.  Expresses grave concern in particular at: 

 (a)  The continuing practice of enforced disappearances, use of violence 
against peaceful demonstrators, rape and other forms of sexual violence, torture and 
cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, arbitrary detentions, including those that 
resulted from the repression of peaceful protests in 2007, the extension, once again, of 
the house arrest of the General Secretary of the National League for Democracy, Aung 
San Suu Kyi, as well as the high and increasing number of political prisoners, 
including other political leaders, persons belonging to ethnic nationalities and human 
rights defenders, despite the recent release of a small number of them, including 
U Win Tin;

 (b)  The continuing imposition of severe restrictions on the exercise of 
fundamental freedoms such as the freedom of movement, expression, association and 
assembly, in particular the lack of an independent judiciary and the use of censorship; 

 (c)  The major and repeated violations of international humanitarian law 
committed against civilians; 

 (d)  The continuing discrimination and violations suffered by persons 
belonging to ethnic nationalities of Myanmar, and attacks by military forces and 
non-State armed groups on villages in Karen State and other ethnic States in 
Myanmar, leading to extensive forced displacements and serious violations and other 
abuses of the human rights of the affected populations; 

 (e)  The absence of effective and genuine participation of the representatives of 
the National League for Democracy and other political parties and some ethnic groups 
in a genuine process of dialogue, national reconciliation and transition to democracy; 
the fact that the country’s political processes are not transparent, inclusive, free and 
fair, and that the procedures established for the drafting of the constitution resulted in 
the de facto exclusion of the opposition from the process; and the decision of the 
Government of Myanmar to proceed with the constitutional referendum in an 
atmosphere of intimidation and without regard to international standards of free and 
fair elections at a time of dire humanitarian need; 

 (f)  Forced labour and forced displacement, as well as the continuous 
deterioration of the living conditions and the increase of poverty affecting a 
significant part of the population throughout the country, with serious consequences 
for the enjoyment of their economic, social and cultural rights; 

 (g)  The climate of impunity due to the fact that perpetrators of human rights 
violations and abuses are not brought to justice, thereby denying the victims any 
effective remedy; 

 3.  Welcomes: 

 (a)  The visits to Myanmar of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General, and 
expresses appreciation for the work of the good offices mission of the Secretary-
General but notes only limited cooperation by the Government of Myanmar with this 
mission in 2008; 

 (b)  The progress report presented by the Government of Myanmar and the

Myanmar signed in 2007 and designed to provide a mechanism to enable victims of 
forced labour to seek redress; 

 (c)  The submission by the Government of Myanmar of its third periodic report

08-58053 4 
 

encourages the Group to do its utmost to encourage the Government to respect human 
rights and allow a peaceful transition to democracy; 

 (f)  The role played by countries neighbouring Myanmar and members of the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations in support of the good offices mission of the 
Secretary-General, and encourages them to intensify their efforts in this regard; 

 (g)  The constructive role played by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations

the humanitarian crisis caused by Cyclone Nargis; 

 4.  Strongly calls upon the Government of Myanmar:

the inhabitants of the country;

investigation, primarily by the Special Rapporteur, into all reports of human rights

treatment, rape and other forms of sexual violence, forced labour and forced 
displacement, and to bring those responsible to justice in order to end impunity for 
violations of human rights; 

 (c)  To reveal the whereabouts of persons who are detained or missing or who 
have been subjected to enforced disappearance; 

 (d)  To seize the opportunity of the good offices of the Secretary-General and 
to cooperate fully with the good offices mission in the fulfilment of its responsibilities 
as mandated by the General Assembly, namely, the release of political prisoners and 
the commencement of a substantive dialogue on democratic transition; such 
cooperation shall include facilitating the visits of the Special Adviser to the country, 
allowing him unrestricted access to all relevant parties, including the highest level of

minorities, student leaders and other opposition groups, and engaging in a genuine 
and fruitful process aiming at achieving tangible progress towards democratic reform
