land, the forced transfer of Palestinian civilians, including Bedouin families, the 

exploitation of natural resources, the fragmentation of territory and other actions 

against the Palestinian civilian population and the civilian population in the 

occupied Syrian Golan that are contrary to international law,  

 Bearing in mind the extremely detrimental impact of Israeli settlement 

policies, decisions and activities on the ongoing regional and international efforts to 

resume and advance the peace process, on the prospects for the achievement of 

peace in the Middle East in accordance with the two -State solution of Israel and 

Palestine, living side by side in peace and security within recognized borders, on the 

basis of the pre-1967 borders, and on the viability and credibility of that solution,  

 Expressing grave concern about the continuation by Israel, the occupying 

Power, of settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 

Jerusalem, and condemning those activities as violations of international 

humanitarian law, relevant United Nations resolutions, the agreements reached 

between the parties and obligations under the Quartet road map and as actions in 

defiance of the calls by the international community to cease all settlement 

activities, 

 Condemning settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 

including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan and any activities 

involving the confiscation of land, the disruption of the livelihood of protected 

persons, the forced transfer of civilians and the de facto annexation of land,  

 Deploring in particular Israel’s construction and expansion of settlements in 

and around occupied East Jerusalem, including its so-called E-1 plan that aims to 

connect its illegal settlements around and further isolate occupied East Jerusalem, 

the continuing demolition of Palestinian homes and eviction of Palestinian families 

from the city, the revocation of Palestinian residency rights in the city, and ongoing 

settlement activities in the Jordan Valley, all of which further fragment and 

undermine the contiguity of the Occupied Palestinian Terri tory, 

 Taking note of the Quartet report of 1 July 2016,
11

 and stressing its 

recommendations, as well as its recent statements, including of 30 September 2015, 

23 October 2015, 12 February 2016 and 23 September 2016, in which the Quartet 

members concluded that, inter alia, the continuing policy of settlement construction 

and expansion, designation of land for exclusive Israeli use and denial of Palestinian 

development, including the recent high rate of demolitions, are steadily eroding the 

two-State solution, 

 Deploring the continuing unlawful construction by Israel of the wall inside the 

Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and 

expressing its concern, in particular, about the route of the wall in departure from 

the Armistice Line of 1949, which is causing humanitarian hardship and a serious 

decline of socioeconomic conditions for the Palestinian people, fragmenting the 

territorial contiguity of the Territory and undermining its viability, and which could 

prejudge future negotiations and make the two-State solution physically impossible 

to implement,

include the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian 

Territory, including East Jerusalem, 

 Condemning acts of violence and terror against civilians on both sides, and 

recalling the need to end all acts of violence, including acts of terror, provocation, 

incitement and destruction, 

 Condemning also all acts of violence, destruction, harassment, provocation 

and incitement by Israeli settlers in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 

East Jerusalem, against Palestinian civilians, including children, and their 

properties, including historic and religious sites, and agricultural lands, as well as 

acts of terror by several extremist Israeli settlers, and calling for accountability for 

the illegal actions perpetrated in this regard,  

 Taking note of the relevant reports of the Secretary-Genera1,
12

  

 Noting the special meeting of the Security Council convened on 26 September 

2008, as well as the meeting of the Council of 18 February 2011,

an obstacle to peace and economic and social development;  

 2. Calls upon Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the Geneva 

Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 

12 August 1949,
1
 to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 

and to the occupied Syrian Golan and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the 

Convention, in particular article 49, and to comply with all of its obligations under 

international law and cease immediately all actions causing the alteration of the 

character, status and demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian 

Territory, including East Jerusalem, and of the occupied Syrian Golan;  

 3. Reiterates its demand for the immediate and complete cessation of all 

Israeli settlement activities in all of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 

East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan, and calls in this regard for the 

full implementation of all the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, 

including, inter alia, resolutions 446 (1979), 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979, 465 

(1980), 476 (1980) and 1515 (2003) of 19 November 2003; 

 4. Calls for the consideration of measures of accountability, in accordance 

with international law, in the case of continued non -compliance, stressing that 

compliance with and respect for international humanitarian law and international 

human rights law is a cornerstone for peace and security in the region;  

 5. Stresses that a complete cessation of all Israeli settlement activities is 

essential for salvaging the two-State solution on the basis of the pre-1967 borders, 

and calls for affirmative steps to be taken immediately to reverse the negative trends 

on the ground that are imperilling the viability of the two-State solution;
