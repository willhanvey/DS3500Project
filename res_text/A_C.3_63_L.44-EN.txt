  Promotion of a democratic and equitable international order 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions on the promotion of a democratic and 
equitable international order, including General Assembly resolution 61/160 of 
19 December 2006, and taking note of Human Rights Council resolution 8/5 of 
18 June 2008,  

 Reaffirming the commitment of all States to fulfil their obligations to promote 
universal respect for, and observance and protection of, all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, 
other instruments relating to human rights and international law, 

 Affirming that the enhancement of international cooperation for the promotion 
and protection of all human rights should continue to be carried out in full 
conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter and international law as 
set forth in Articles 1 and 2 of the Charter and, inter alia, with full respect for 
sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence, the non-use of force or the 
threat of force in international relations and non-intervention in matters that are 
essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State, 

 Recalling the Preamble to the Charter, in particular the determination to 
reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human 
person and in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, 



A/C.3/63/L.44  
 

08-58090 2 
 

 Reaffirming that everyone is entitled to a social and international order in 
which the rights and freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights1 can be fully realized, 

 Reaffirming also the determination expressed in the Preamble to the Charter to 
save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, to establish conditions under 
which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources 
of international law can be maintained, to promote social progress and better 
standards of life in larger freedom, to practice tolerance and good-neighbourliness, 
and to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social 
advancement of all peoples, 

 Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the 
aspirations of all peoples for an international order based on the principles enshrined 
in the Charter, including promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all and respect for the principle of equal rights and self-
determination of peoples, peace, democracy, justice, equality, the rule of law, 
pluralism, development, better standards of living and solidarity,  

 Considering also that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims 
that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone 
is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein, without distinction of any 
kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
national or social origin, property, birth or other status, 

 Reaffirming that democracy, development and respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing, and that 
democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their 
own political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in 
all aspects of their lives, 

 Emphasizing that democracy is not only a political concept but that it also has 
economic and social dimensions, 

 Recognizing that democracy, respect for all human rights, including the right 
to development, transparent and accountable governance and administration in all 
sectors of society, and effective participation by civil society are an essential part of 
the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred 
sustainable development,  

 Noting with concern that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance may be aggravated by, inter alia, inequitable distribution of wealth, 
marginalization and social exclusion, 

 Underlining the fact that it is imperative for the international community to 
ensure that globalization becomes a positive force for all the world’s people, and 
that only through broad and sustained efforts, based on common humanity in all its 
diversity, can globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable, 

 Recognizing the complex character of the worsening of the current global food, 
fuel and financial crises, in which the adequate enjoyment of all human rights is 
threatened to be violated, as a combination of several major factors, including 
macroeconomic and other factors, such as environmental degradation,

desertification and global climate change, natural disasters and the lack of the 
technology necessary to confront its impact, particularly in developing countries and 
least developed countries, 

 Stressing that efforts to make globalization fully inclusive and equitable must 
include policies and measures, at the global level, that correspond to the needs of 
developing countries and countries with economies in transition and are formulated 
and implemented with their effective participation, 

 Having listened to the peoples of the world, and recognizing their aspirations 
to justice, to equality of opportunity for all, to the enjoyment of their human rights, 
including the right to development, to live in peace and freedom and to equal 
participation without discrimination in economic, social, cultural, civil and political 
life,

sustainable development, global communications through the use of new 
technologies, and increased intercultural exchange through the preservation and

sustained efforts to create a shared future based upon our common humanity and all 
its diversity can globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable;

freedoms;
