generated growing demand for the services of the Centre, which as a result will not

resources on an ongoing basis from the regular budget of the United Nations, as

and regional consultations on United Nations human rights mechanisms, human 
trafficking, media and human rights education; 

 4. Further notes that the Centre is receiving an increasing number of 
requests for training and documentation, including in the Arabic language, which 
require additional resources and the reinforcement of its activities; 

 5. Requests the Secretary-General to provide funds and human resources 
from the regular budget of the United Nations, beginning in the biennium 
2014-2015, to enable the Centre to respond positively and effectively to the growing 
needs in South-West Asia and the Arab region, to fulfil its mandate to undertake 
training and documentation activities and to support such efforts undertaken within 
the region by Governments, United Nations agencies and programmes, national 
human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations according to 
international human rights standards;
