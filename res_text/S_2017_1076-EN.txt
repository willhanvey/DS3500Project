https://undocs.org/S/RES/1373(2001)


S/2017/1076 
 

 

17-23098 6/10 

 

 4. Underscores that neutral, expert assessment of the implementation of 

resolutions 1373 (2001), 1624 (2005), 2178 (2014), and other relevant resolutions, is

 7. Directs the CTC, with the support of CTED, to determine on an annual 

basis a list of Member States that CTED should request consent to visit for the purpose 

of conducting assessments, and underscores that the composition of the list should 

take a risk-based approach that acknowledges existing gaps, emerging issues, trends, 

events, and analysis, while also taking into account prior requests by Member States 

and consent previously expressed, as well as the fact that a number of Member States 

have never been visited, and underscores further that the CTC, with the support of 

CTED, may decide, after the adoption of the list, on changes to its composition, as 

necessary, emphasizing transparency in planning for visits and producing ensuing 

reports;  

 8. Directs CTED, through its visits, assessments, and analytical work on 

emerging issues, trends, and developments to support Member States and United 

Nations entities in taking measures, pursuant to international law, to address 

conditions conducive to terrorism and violent extremism as and when conducive to 

terrorism, in accordance with the United Nations Global Counterterrorism Strategy, 

in coordination with and support of UNOCT;  

 9. Directs CTED to report to the CTC by 30 March 2018 on potential ways 

to strengthen the assessment process, including through considering targeted and 

focused follow-up visits as complements to CTED’s comprehensive assessments, 

using, as appropriate and bearing in mind CTED’s global mandate, a risk-based 

approach in response to evolving threats, shortening, in so far as possible, timelines 

for drafting and review of reports, bearing in mind differences in Member State 

capacity, enhancing fair and consistent application of assessment tools, and, at the 

behest of assessed Member States, engaging with counterterrorism experts in civil 

society, academia, think tanks, and the private sector, including in visits to and 

assessments of Member States, as a complement to primary engagement  with Member 

State actors to allow them to highlight productive counterterrorism efforts, so that 

assessments are more useful, accessible, and targeted to specific audiences;  

 10. Requests the CTC Chair to invite senior officials from assessed Member 

States to attend relevant CTC meetings, and requests further the Chair to invite 

assessed Member States to coordinate with CTED and UNOCT on implementation of

need for additional follow-up activities, as appropriate, to further implementation of 

assessment recommendations, including, as appropriate, additional technical 

assistance;  

 11. Directs CTED to report to the CTC in a timely manner, on a regular basis 

or when the CTC so requests, through oral and/or written briefings on the work of 

CTED, including its visits to Member States, status of coordination with relevant 

United Nations bodies, engagement with relevant non-United Nations actors, conduct 

of assessments, representation of the CTC at different international and regional 

meetings, and other activities, including during planning stages, and to conduct an 

annual review and forecast of activities to facilitate implementation of resolutions 

1373 (2001), 1624 (2005), 2178 (2014), and other relevant resolutions, and, in this 

context, requests the CTC, with the support of CTED, to continue to hold periodic 

meetings, including with a regional or thematic focus, for all Member States and
