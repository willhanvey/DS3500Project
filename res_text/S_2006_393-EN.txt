 The Security Council, 

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 23 May 2006 (S/2006/315) 
on the United Nations operation in Cyprus, 

 Reiterating its call to the parties to assess and address the humanitarian issue 
of missing persons with due urgency and seriousness, and welcoming in this regard 
the resumption of the activities of the Committee on Missing Persons since August 
2004, as well as the appointment by the Secretary-General of a Third Member who 
will assume his duties in July 2006, 

 Noting that the Government of Cyprus is agreed that in view of the prevailing 
conditions in the island it is necessary to keep UNFICYP beyond 15 June 2006, 

 Taking note of the assessment of the Secretary-General that the security 
situation on the island continues to be stable and that the situation along the Green 
Line remains calm, and expressing the hope that there will be a decrease in the 
overall number of incidents involving the two sides, 

 Urging both sides to avoid any action which could lead to an increase in 
tension and, in this context, noting with concern sequential developments in the 
vicinity of Dherinia, the increase in unauthorized construction of building for 
personal and commercial use in the buffer zone, and developments at certain 
checkpoints in sector four, including new restrictions on UNFICYP’s freedom of 
movement, and encouraging both sides to engage in consultations with UNFICYP 
on the demarcation of the buffer zone, and to respect UNFICYP’s mandate and 
operations in the buffer zone, 

 Regretting that the gap between words and deeds remains too great for the 
Secretary-General to resume fully his good offices mission and urging progress 
towards the resumption of negotiations for a comprehensive settlement. In this 
context welcoming the Secretary-General’s efforts to encourage renewed 
bicommunal contacts, and the agreement to a proposal to establish a mechanism for 
bicommunal discussions at the technical level, as well as the agreement of both 
leaders to meet on the occasion of the installation of the Third Member of the 
Committee on Missing Persons on Cyprus, 

 Welcoming progress in demining, particularly in the Nicosia area, and 
expressing strong support for UNFICYP’s efforts to extend demining operations to 
Turkish Forces minefields in the rest of the buffer zone, 



S/2006/393  
 

2 06-39040 
 

 Welcoming the fact that over 10 million crossings by Greek Cypriots to the 
north and Turkish Cypriots to the south have taken place peacefully, and 
encouraging the opening of additional crossing points, 

 Expressing concern at continued disagreement over construction activity 
relating to the proposed additional crossing point at Ledra Street and urging both 
sides to cooperate with UNFICYP to resolve this issue, 

 Welcoming the emphasis of the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on greater cohesiveness in the efforts of the United Nations 
family in Cyprus, as well as the Secretary-General’s intention to keep the operations 
of UNFICYP under close review while continuing to take into account 
developments on the ground and the views of the parties, and to revert to the 
Council with recommendations as appropriate for further adjustments to 
UNFICYP’s mandate, force levels and concept of operation as soon as warranted, 

 Welcoming all efforts to promote bicommunal contacts and events, including, 
inter alia, on the part of the United Nations, and urging the two sides to promote 
further bicommunal contacts and to remove any obstacles to such contacts, 

 Echoing the Secretary-General’s gratitude to the Government of Cyprus and 
the Government of Greece for their voluntary contributions to the funding of 
UNFICYP, and his request for further voluntary contributions from other countries 
and organizations, 

 Welcoming and encouraging efforts by the United Nations to sensitize 
peacekeeping personnel in the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS and other 
communicable diseases in all its peacekeeping operations, 

 1. Reaffirms all its relevant resolutions on Cyprus, in particular resolution 
1251 (1999) of 29 June 1999 and subsequent resolutions; 

 2. Expresses its full support for UNFICYP, including its mandate in the 
buffer zone, and decides to extend its mandate for a further period ending 
15 December 2006; 

 3. Calls on the Turkish Cypriot side and Turkish forces to restore in 
Strovilia the military status quo which existed there prior to 30 June 2000; 

 4. Encourages active participation in bicommunal discussions at the 
technical level, under the leadership of the SRSG, and expresses its full support for 
the latter; 

 5. Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report on implementation of 
this resolution by 1 December 2006; 

 6. Welcomes the efforts being undertaken by UNFICYP to implement the 
Secretary-General’s zero tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and to 
ensure full compliance of its personnel with the United Nations code of conduct, 
requests the Secretary-General to continue to take all necessary action in this regard 
and to keep the Security Council informed, and urges troop-contributing countries to 
take appropriate preventive action including the conduct of pre-deployment 
awareness training, and to take disciplinary action and other action to ensure full 
accountability in cases of such conduct involving their personnel; 

 7. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
