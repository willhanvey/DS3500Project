Presidential Statements of 3 August 2011, 21 March 2012, 5 April 2012 and 2 October 
2013,  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 
territorial integrity of Syria, and to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the 
United Nations,  

 Being appalled at the unacceptable and escalating level of violence and the 
death of well over 100,000 people in Syria, including over 10,000 children, as 
reported by the United Nations Secretary-General and the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, 

 Expressing grave alarm at the significant and rapid deterioration of the 
humanitarian situation in Syria, in particular the dire situation of hundreds of 
thousands of civilians trapped in besieged areas, most of whom are besieged by the 
Syrian armed forces and some by opposition groups, as well as the dire situation of 
over 3 million people in hard-to-reach areas, and deploring the difficulties in 
providing, and the failure to provide, access for the humanitarian assistance to all 
civilians in need inside Syria, 

 Emphasizing the need to respect the United Nations guiding principles of 
humanitarian emergency assistance and stressing the importance of such assistance 
being delivered on the basis of need, devoid of any political prejudices and aims, 
commending the efforts of the United Nations and all humanitarian and medical 
personnel in Syria and in neighbouring countries, and condemning all acts or threats 
of violence against United Nations staff and humanitarian actors, which have 
resulted in the death, injury and detention of many humanitarian personnel, 

 Expressing grave concern at the increasing number of refugees and internally 
displaced persons caused by the conflict in Syria, which has a destabilizing impact 
on the entire region, and underscoring its appreciation for the significant and 
admirable efforts that have been made by the countries of the region, notably 
Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt, to accommodate the more than 2.4 million 
refugees who have fled Syria as a result of the ongoing violence, while 
acknowledging the enormous political, socioeconomic and financial impact of the 



S/2014/115  
 

14-24333 2/5 
 

presence of large-scale populations in these countries, and underscoring the need for 
all parties to respect and maintain the security and civilian character of camps for 
refugees and internally displaced persons,  

 Welcoming the pledges totalling $2.5 billion at the Second International 
Humanitarian Pledging Conference for Syria, hosted by Kuwait on 15 January 2014, 
and expressing its appreciation to Member States and regional and subregional 
organizations that have pledged to provide humanitarian assistance to people in need 
in all parts of Syria, including internally displaced persons, as well as to refugees in 
neighbouring host countries, and calling on all Member States to ensure the timely 
disbursement of pledges and continued support in line with growing humanitarian 
needs, 

 Calling on all parties to immediately end all violence which has led to human 
suffering in Syria, save Syria’s rich societal mosaic and cultural heritage, and take 
appropriate steps to ensure the protection of Syria’s World Heritage Sites, 

 Strongly condemning the increased terrorist attacks resulting in numerous 
casualties and destruction carried out by organizations and individuals associated 
with Al-Qaeda, its affiliates and other terrorist groups, and reiterating its call on all 
parties to commit to putting an end to terrorist acts perpetrated by such 
organizations and individuals, while reaffirming that terrorism in all its forms and 
manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and 
security, and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of 
their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed,  

 Expressing its regret that its Presidential Statement of 2 October 2013 
(S/PRST/2013/15) has not delivered as expected and has not yet translated into 
meaningful progress on the ground, and that humanitarian aid delivery continues to 
be impeded throughout Syria, while condemning all cases of denial of humanitarian 
access and recalling that arbitrary denial of humanitarian access and depriving 
civilians of objects indispensable to their survival, including wilfully impeding 
relief supply and access, can constitute a violation of international humanitarian law,

absence of a political solution to the crisis, reiterating its endorsement of the 
Geneva Communiqué of 30 June 2012 (Annex II of resolution 2118 (2113)) and

all violence, violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international 
law, and facilitating the Syrian-led political process launched in Monteux on

own future,
