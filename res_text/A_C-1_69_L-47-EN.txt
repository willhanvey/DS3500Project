participation and representation of women in policymaking, planning and 
implementation processes related to disarmament, non-proliferation and arms 
control,

security;

 5. Urges Member States to support and strengthen the effective participation 
of women in organizations in the field of disarmament at the local, national, 
subregional and regional levels;
