the fact that some groups continue to refuse to join this process and strongly urging 
them to do so without further delay or preconditions, 

 Welcoming the outcome of the 31 May 2011 All Darfur Stakeholders

Government of Sudan and the Liberation and Justice Movement (LJM) on the 
adoption of the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD) as a important step

the Government of Sudan and all the armed movements; encouraging the AU and 
the UN actively to pursue their efforts, 

 Underlining, without prejudice to the Security Council’s primary responsibility 
for the maintenance of international peace and security, the importance of the 
partnership between the UN and the AU, consistent with Chapter VIII of the UN 
Charter, with regard to the maintenance of peace and security in Africa, particularly 
in Sudan, and welcoming, in particular, the efforts of the AU High Level 
Implementation Panel for Sudan under the leadership of President Mbeki working in 
cooperation with UNAMID, to address in a comprehensive and inclusive manner the 
challenges of peace, justice and reconciliation in Darfur, 

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 08 July (S/2011/422) on 
UNAMID, 

 Stressing the need for the Council to pursue a rigorous, strategic approach to 
peacekeeping deployments, with a view to enhancing the effectiveness of 
peacekeeping missions; welcoming and further encouraging the increasingly full 
implementation by UNAMID of its Chapter VII mandate, and underlining, in this 
regard, the importance of addressing the requirement for UNAMID to be able to 
deter threats to the implementation of its mandate, and the safety and security of its 
peacekeeping personnel in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, 

 Expressing deep concern at the deteriorating security situation in some parts of 
Darfur, including ceasefire violations, attacks by rebel groups, aerial bombardment 
by the Government of Sudan, inter-tribal fighting, attacks on humanitarian 
personnel and peacekeepers, which have restricted humanitarian access to conflict 
areas where vulnerable civilian populations reside, as contained in the report in the 
Secretary-General, and the displacement of tens of thousands of civilians, and 
calling on all parties to cease hostilities, including all acts of violence committed 
against civilians, and urgently facilitate unhindered humanitarian access,  

 Expressing its concern at the return to hostilities between the Government of

ongoing hostilities between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan Liberation 
Army, Abdul Wahid faction (SLA/AW), and the Justice and Equality Movement 
(JEM), and reiterating that there can be no military solution to the conflict in 



 S/2011/471

peace, 

 Reiterating its condemnation of all violations of international human rights 
and humanitarian law in Darfur and in relation to Darfur, calling on all parties to 
comply with their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian 
law, emphasizing the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes, and 
urging the Government of Sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect,  

 Reaffirming its concern over the negative effect of the ongoing violence in 
Darfur on the stability of Sudan as a whole as well as the region, welcoming 
improved relations between Sudan and Chad, as well as the deployment of a joint 
force, including forces from the Central African Republic (CAR) under a joint 
command along the border, and encouraging Sudan, Chad and CAR to continue to 
co-operate in order to achieve peace and stability in Darfur and the wider region,  

 Expressing concern about alleged links between armed movements in Darfur 
and groups outside Darfur, 

 Determining that the situation in Sudan constitutes a threat to international 
peace and security, 

 1. Decides to extend the mandate of UNAMID as set out in resolution 1769 
(2007) for a further 12 months to 31 July 2012; 

 2. Welcomes the Secretary-General’s intention to review, in consultation 
with the African Union, the uniformed personnel required for UNAMID to ensure 
the most efficient and effective implementation of the mission’s mandate, and 
requests the Secretary-General to report on this issue within the framework set out 
in paragraph 13 and no later than 180 days from the adoption of this resolution;  

 3. Underlines the need for UNAMID to make full use of its mandate and 
capabilities, giving priority in decisions about the use of available capacity and 
resources to (a) the protection of civilians across Darfur, including through 
proactive deployment and patrols in areas at high risk of conflict, securing IDP 
camps and adjacent areas, and implementation of a mission-wide early warning 
strategy and capacity and (b) ensuring safe, timely and unhindered humanitarian 
access, and the safety and security of humanitarian personnel and humanitarian 
activities, so as to facilitate the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance 
throughout Darfur; and requests UNAMID to maximise the use of its capabilities, in 
cooperation with the UN Country Team and other international and non 
governmental actors, in the implementation of its mission-wide comprehensive 
strategy for the achievement of these objectives; 

 4. Reaffirms the importance of promoting the AU-UN led peace and 
political process for Darfur, and welcomes the priority given to UNAMID’s 
continuing efforts to support and complement this work in accordance with 
paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 below, and welcomes the efforts of the AU High Level Panel 
for Sudan in this regard; 

 5. Emphasizes UNAMID’s Chapter VII mandate, as defined in resolution 
1769, to deliver its core tasks to protect civilians without prejudice to the primary 
responsibility of the Government of Sudan and to ensure the freedom of movement 
and security of UNAMID’s own personnel and humanitarian workers; 



S/2011/471  
 

11-43891 4 
 

 6. Demands that all parties to the conflict, including all armed movements 
engage immediately and without preconditions to make every effort to reach a 
permanent ceasefire and a comprehensive peace settlement on the basis of the Doha 
Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD), in order to bring a stable and durable peace 
to the region; 

 7. Recognizes, in this context, the potential complementary role of a Darfur-
based Political Process (DPP) led by the AU and the UN; calls on the Government 
of Sudan and the armed movements to contribute to the creation of the necessary 
enabling environment for a DPP that allows the systematic and sustained 
engagement of all Darfurian stakeholders in constructive and open dialogue; notes 
that, despite some positive developments in the peace process, important elements 
of the necessary enabling environment for a DPP, including but not limited to 
respect for the civil and political rights of participants, such that they can exercise 
their views without fear of retribution, freedom of speech and assembly to permit 
open consultations, freedom of movement of participants and UNAMID, 
proportional participation among Darfurians, freedom from harassment, arbitrary 
arrest, and intimidation, and freedom from interference by the Government or the 
armed movements, are not yet in place;  

 8. Requests the Secretary-General to include in his regular reports referred 
to in paragraph 13 below, assessments of the elements set out in paragraph 7 above 
to enable the Council, taking into account the views of the AU, to determine 
UNAMID’s further engagement in support of the DPP; 

 9. Welcomes the Secretary-General’s intention to develop a roadmap for the 
Darfur peace process, and requests the Secretary-General, in this regard, to work in 
close consultation with the AU, also consulting, as appropriate, all Sudanese 
stakeholders and the Implementation Follow-up Committee (IFC), and taking into 
account paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 above, and requests the Secretary-General to report to 
the Council on the roadmap in his next 90-day report; 

 10. Commends the contribution of troop and police contributing countries 
and donors to UNAMID; strongly condemns all attacks on UNAMID; underlines 
that any attack or threat of attack on UNAMID is unacceptable; demands that there 
be no recurrence of such attacks, stresses the need to enhance the safety and security 
of UNAMID personnel, as well as the need to bring an end to impunity for those 
who attack peacekeepers, and in this regard urges the Government of Sudan to do its 
utmost to bring the perpetrators of any such crimes to justice; 

 11. Commends the credible work of the Tripartite Mechanism but expresses 
deep concern at continuing restrictions placed upon UNAMID movement and 
operations, particularly to areas of recent conflict; calls on all parties in Darfur to 
remove all obstacles to UNAMID’s full and proper discharge of its mandate, 
including by ensuring its security and freedom of movement; and in this regard, 
demands that the Government of Sudan comply with the Status of Forces Agreement 
fully and without delay, particularly regarding flight and equipment clearances, the 
removal of all obstacles to the use of UNAMID aerial assets, and the timely 
provision of visas for UNAMID personnel; deplores the continued delays in the 
provision of such visas, which threaten seriously to undermine the ability of the 
mission to implement its mandate and urges the Government of Sudan to deliver on 
its welcome commitment to clear the backlog of visa applications; and expresses 
deep concern that UNAMID national staff members were detained by the 



 S/2011/471

Government of Sudan in violation of the Status of Forces Agreement, and demands 
that the Government of Sudan respect the rights of UNAMID personnel under the 
SOFA; 

 12. Demands that UNAMID be given a licence for its own radio transmitter 
in line with the provisions of the Status of Forces Agreement, so that it can 
communicate freely with all Darfuri stakeholders;  

 13. Requests the Secretary-General to continue reporting to the Council 
every 90 days on progress made towards implementing UNAMID’s mandate across 
Darfur, including on progress towards and obstacles to the implementation of the 
strategy referred to in paragraph 3 above, also including an assessment of progress 
against the benchmarks and indicators set out in Annex II of the report of the 
Secretary-General of 16 November 2009 as well, the security and humanitarian 
situation, including in the IDP sites and refugee camps, human rights, violations of 
international humanitarian and human rights law, and early recovery and all parties 
compliance with their international obligations; 

 14. Demands that all parties to the conflict in Darfur immediately end

law; affirms, in this context, the Council’s condemnation of serious violations of 
international humanitarian law and human rights law; calls for an immediate 
cessation of hostilities and for all parties to commit themselves to a sustained and 
permanent ceasefire; requests the Secretary-General to consult with relevant parties 
with a view to developing a more effective ceasefire monitoring mechanism; and 
underlines the need for UNAMID to report on major instances of violence which 
undermines the parties’ full and constructive efforts towards peace; 

 15. Expresses its serious concern at the deterioration of the humanitarian 
situation in some parts of Darfur, the continued threats to humanitarian 
organisations, and the restricted humanitarian access in Darfur resulting from 
increased insecurity, attacks against humanitarian workers, denial of access by the 
parties to the conflict, calls for the full implementation of the Communiqué between 
the Government of Sudan and the United Nations on Facilitation of Humanitarian 
Activities in Darfur, including regarding the timely issuance of visas and travel 
permits for humanitarian organisations; and demands that the Government of Sudan, 
all militias, armed groups and all other stakeholders ensure the full, safe and 
unhindered access of humanitarian organizations and relief personnel and the 
delivery of humanitarian assistance to populations in need and underscores the 
importance of upholding the principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence 
in the provision of humanitarian assistance;

arbitrary arrests and detentions, expresses deep concern about the situation of all 
those so detained, including civil society members and IDPs, and emphasizes the 
importance of ensuring UNAMID, within its current mandate, and other relevant 
organisations’ ability to monitor such cases; calls on the Government of Sudan fully 
to respect its obligations, including by fulfilling its commitment to lift the state of 
emergency in Darfur, releasing all political prisoners, allowing free expression and 
undertaking effective efforts to ensure accountability for serious violations of 
international human rights and humanitarian law, by whomsoever perpetrated, and 
emphasizes the importance of UNAMID acting to promote human rights, bring

Secretary-General, stresses the importance of the Joint Verification Mechanism in 
verifying the voluntariness of returns and expresses deep concern over some 
bureaucratic obstacles that undermine its effectiveness and independence;

reconciliation; expresses deep concern over the proliferation of arms, in particular 
small arms and light weapons, and, in this regard, requests UNAMID to continue to
