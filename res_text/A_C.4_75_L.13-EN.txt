other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including the occupied Syrian 

Golan, 

 Affirming that the transfer by the occupying Power of parts of its own civilian 

population into the territory it occupies constitutes a breach of the Fourth Geneva  

Convention,4 

 Recalling the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International 

Court of Justice on the legal consequences of the construction of a wall in the 

Occupied Palestinian Territory,5 and recalling also General Assembly resolutions 

ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004 and ES-10/17 of 15 December 2006, 

 Noting that the International Court of Justice concluded that “the Israeli 

settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have 

been established in breach of international law”,6  

 Taking note of the recent reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights 

Council on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied s ince

Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem,8  

 Recalling also the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government 

Arrangements of 13 September 19939 and the subsequent implementation agreements 

between the Palestinian and Israeli sides,  

 Recalling further the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State solution to the 

Israeli-Palestinian conflict,10 and emphasizing specifically its call for a freeze on all

obligations and commitments in this regard,

side by side in peace and security within recognized borders, on the basis of the 

pre-1967 borders, and on the viability and credibility of that solution,  

 Condemning settlement activities by Israel, the occupying Power, in the 

Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, as violations of 

international humanitarian law, relevant United Nations resolutions, the agreements 

reached between the parties and obligations under the Quartet road map and as actions 

in defiance of the calls by the international community to cease all settlement 

activities, 

 Deploring in particular Israel’s construction and expansion of settlements in 

and around occupied East Jerusalem, including its so-called E-1 plan that aims to 

connect its illegal settlements around and further isolate occupied East Jerusalem, the 

continuing demolition of Palestinian homes and eviction of Palestinian families from 

the city, the revocation of Palestinian residency rights in the city, and ongoing 

settlement activities in the Jordan Valley, all of which further fragment and undermine 

the contiguity of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 

 Deploring the plans to demolish the Palestinian village of Khan al -Ahmar, in 

contravention of international law, which would have serious consequences with 

regard to the displacement of its residents, severely threaten the viability of the 

two-State solution and undermine the prospect of peace, given the area’s sensitive 

location and importance for preserving the contiguity of the Palestinian territory, and 

demanding the cessation of such plans,  

 Condemning the demolition by Israel, in contravention of international law, of 

Palestinian buildings in the neighbourhood of Wadi al-Hummus in the village of Sur 

Bahir, south of occupied East Jerusalem,  

 Taking note of the Quartet report of 1 July 2016,11 and stressing its 

recommendations, as well as its relevant statements in which the Quartet members 

concluded that, inter alia, the continuing policy of settlement construction and 

expansion, designation of land for exclusive Israeli use and denial of Palestinian 

development, including the recent high rate of demolitions, are steadily eroding the 

two-State solution, 

 Deploring the continuing unlawful construction by Israel of the wall inside the 

Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and 

expressing its concern, in particular, about the route of the wall in departure from the 

Armistice Line of 1949 and in such a way as to include the great majority of the Israeli 

settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and 

which is causing humanitarian hardship and a serious decline of socioeconomic 

conditions for the Palestinian people, is fragmenting the territorial contiguity of the 

Territory and undermining its viability, and could prejudge future negotiations and 

make the two-State solution physically impossible to implement,  

 Condemning acts of violence and terror against civilians on both sides, and 

recalling the need to end all acts of violence, including acts of terror, provocation, 

incitement and destruction, 

 Condemning also all acts of violence, destruction, harassment, provocation and 

incitement by Israeli settlers in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 

Jerusalem, against Palestinian civilians, including children, and their properties, 

including historic and religious sites, and agricultural lands, as well as acts of terror 

by several extremist Israeli settlers, and calling for accountability for the illegal 

actions perpetrated in this regard,

20-14181 4/6 

 

 Taking note of the relevant reports of the Secretary-General, including pursuant 

to Security Council resolution 2334 (2016),12  

 1. Reaffirms that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 

including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan are illegal and an obstacle 

to peace and economic and social development;  

 2. Demands that Israel accept the de jure applicability of the Geneva 

Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 

1949, to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab 

territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including the occupied Syrian Golan, and 

abide scrupulously by the provisions of the Convention, in particular article 49, and 

comply with all of its obligations under international law and cease immediately all 

actions causing the alteration of the character, status and demographic composition 

of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and of the occupied 

Syrian Golan; 

 3. Reiterates its demand for the immediate and complete cessation of all 

Israeli settlement activities in all of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 

Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan, and calls in this regard for the full 

implementation of all the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, including, inter 

alia, resolutions 446 (1979), 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979, 465 (1980), 476 (1980), 478 

(1980), 1515 (2003) of 19 November 2003 and 2334 (2016); 

 4. Stresses that a complete cessation of all Israeli settlement activities is 

essential for salvaging the two-State solution on the basis of the pre-1967 borders, 

and calls for affirmative steps to be taken immediately to reverse the negative trends 

on the ground that are imperilling the viability of the two-State solution; 

 5. Recalls the affirmation by the Security Council, in its resolution 2334 

(2016), that it will not recognize any changes to the 4 June 1967 lines, including with 

regard to Jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties through negotiations;  

 6. Stresses that the occupation of a territory is to be a temporary, de facto 

situation, whereby the occupying Power can neither claim possession nor exert its 

sovereignty over the territory it occupies, recalls in this regard the principle of the 

inadmissibility of the acquisition of land by force and therefore the illegality of the 

annexation of any part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 

Jerusalem, which constitutes a breach of international law, undermines the viability 

of the two-State solution and challenges the prospects for a just, lasting and 

comprehensive peace settlement, and expresses its grave concern at recent statements 

calling for the annexation by Israel of areas in the Occupied Palestinian Territory;  

 7. Condemns in this regard settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian 

Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan and any 

activities involving the confiscation of land, the disruption of the livelihood of 

protected persons, the forced transfer of civilians and the annexation of land , whether 

de facto or through national legislation;  

 8. Demands that Israel, the occupying Power, comply with its legal 

obligations, as mentioned in the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the 

International Court of Justice;  

 9. Reiterates its call for the prevention of all acts of violence, destruction, 

harassment and provocation by Israeli settlers, especially against Palestinian civilians 

and their properties, including historic and religious sites and including in Occupied 

East Jerusalem, and their agricultural lands;

 10. Calls for accountability for the illegal actions perpetrated by Israeli 

settlers in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and stresses in this regard the need for 

the implementation of Security Council resolution 904 (1994), in which the Council 

called upon Israel, the occupying Power, to continue to take and implement measures, 

including the confiscation of arms, aimed at preventing illegal acts of violence by 

Israeli settlers, and called for measures to be taken to guarantee the safety and 

protection of the Palestinian civilians in the occupied territory;  

 11. Stresses the responsibility of Israel, the occupying Power, to investigate 

all acts of settler violence against Palestinian civilians and their properties and to 

ensure accountability for these acts;  

 12. Calls upon all States and international organizations to continue to actively 

pursue policies that ensure respect for their obligations under internat ional law with 

regard to all illegal Israeli practices and measures in the Occupied Palestinian 

Territory, including East Jerusalem, particularly Israeli settlement activities;  

 13. Calls for measures of accountability, consistent with international law, in 

the light of continued non-compliance with the demands for a complete and 

immediate cessation of all settlement activities, which are illegal under international 

law, constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to make a two-State solution 

impossible, stressing that compliance with and respect for international humanitarian 

law and international human rights law is a cornerstone for peace and security in the 

region; 

 14. Recalls, in this regard, the statement of 15 July 1999 and the declarations 

adopted on 5 December 2001 and on 17 December 2014 13 by the Conference of High 

Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention on measures to enforce the 

Convention in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 

welcomes in this regard initiatives by States parties, both individually and 

collectively, in accordance with article 1 of the Convention, aimed at ensuring respect 

for the Convention and accountability, and calls upon al l High Contracting Parties to 

the Convention to continue, individually and collectively, to exert all efforts to ensure 

respect for its provisions by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian 

Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 

1967; 

 15. Also recalls that the Security Council, in its resolution 2334 (2016), called 

upon all States to distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the 

State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967;  

 16. Calls upon all States, consistent with their obligations under international 

law and the relevant resolutions, not to recognize, and not to render aid or assistance 

in maintaining, the situation created by measures that are illegal under international 

law, including those aimed at advancing annexation in the Occupied Palestinian 

Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 

1967; 

 17. Calls upon the relevant United Nations bodies to take all necessary 

measures and actions within their mandates to ensure full respect for and compliance 

with Human Rights Council resolution 17/4 of 16 June 2011,14 concerning the 

Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights15 and other relevant international 

laws and standards, and to ensure the implementation of the United Nations “Protect, 

Respect and Remedy” Framework, which provides a global standard for upholding
