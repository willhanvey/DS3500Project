maintaining these measures until there is clear evidente of profound and
irreversible changes, bearing in mind the objectives of the Declaration,

Notinq that, while oil-exporting States have committed themselves to an oil
embargo against South Africa, very few major shipping States have done SO,

Concerned that the oil embargo against South Africa is still being violated
and that South Africa, because of loopholes in the embargo, such as lack of
effective legislation, has been able to acquire oil and petroleum products,

Convinced that an effective oil embargo against South Africa would contribute
to the efforts of the international community to bring about a negotiated
settlement and the establishment of a united, non-racial and democratic South
Africa,

1. Takes note of the report of the Intergovernmental Group to Monitor the
Supply and Shipping of Oil and Petroleum Products to South Africa 11 and endorses
its recommendations;

2. Commends the proposed model law for the effective enforcement of the oil
embargo against South Africa annexed to the annual report of the Intergovornmental
Group to States for their attention, including consideration of the adoption of the
general principies of the draf"b within the context and framework of their own legal
practices;

3. Urges the Security Council to take action under appropriate provisions af
the Charter of the United Nations to ensure an effective embargo on the supply and
shipping of oil and petroleum products to South Africa in order to effect a speedy
and peaceful eradication of aoartheid;

4 . Reauests al1 States, pending such decisions, to adopt effective measures
and/or legislation to broaden the scope of the oil embargo in order to ensure the
complete cessation of the supply and shipping of oil and petroleum products to
South Africa, whether directly or indirectly, and in particular:

(a) To apply strictly the "end users" clause and other conditions concerning
restriction on destination to ensure compliance with the embargo;

(b) To compel the companies originally selling or purchasing oil or petrcleum
products, as appropriate to each nation, to desist from selling, reselling or
otherwise transferring oil and petroleum products to South Africa, whether directly
or indirectly;

(c) To establish strict control over the supply of oil and petroleum products
to South Africa by intermediaries, oil companies and traders by placing
responsibility for the fulfilment of the contract on the first buyer or seller of
oil and petroleum products who would, therefore, be liable for the actions of these
p a r t i e s ;

(d) To prevent access by South Africa to other sources of energy, including
the supply of raw materials, technical know-how, financia1 assistance and transport;

le) To prohibit al1 assistance to apartheid South Africa, including the- - -
provision of finance, technology, equipment or personnel for the prospecting,

of oil-from-coa1 or oil-from-gas plants or the development and operation of plants
producing fuel substitutes and additives such as ethanol and methanol;

involved in violating the oiï embargo, and to publicize cases of successful
prosecutions in conformity with their national laws;

the oil embargo, including ways and means to prevent such violations, and to take
concerted measures against violators;

(k) To discourage ships capable of carrying oil or petrolewn products in
their national registries or owned or managed by companies or individuals within
their jurisdiction from engaging in activities that give rise to violation of the
oil embargo against South Africa, taking into account legislative and other
measures already adoptad;

5. Authorizes the Intergovernmental Group to take action to promote public
awareness of the oil embargo against South Africa, including, when necessary,
sending missions and participating in relevant conferences and meetings;

6. Reouests the Intergovernmental Group to submit to the General Assembly at
its forty-sixth session a report on the implementation of the present resolution;
