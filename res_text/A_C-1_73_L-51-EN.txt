 The General Assembly, 

 Recognizing the common interest of all humankind in the exploration and use 

of outer space for peaceful purposes,  

 Seriously concerned about the possibility of an arms race in outer space and of 

outer space turning into an arena for military confrontation, and bearing in mind the 

importance of articles III and IV of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities 

of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other 

Celestial Bodies,1  

 Conscious that the prevention of an arms race in outer space would avert a grave 

danger to international peace and security,  

 Reaffirming that practical measures should be examined and taken in the search 

for agreements to prevent an arms race in outer space in a common effort towards a 

community of shared future for humankind, 

 Emphasizing the paramount importance of strict compliance with the existing 

legal regime providing for the peaceful use of outer space,  

 Reaffirming its recognition that the legal regime applicable to outer space by 

itself does not guarantee prevention of an arms race in outer space and that there is a 

need to consolidate and reinforce that regime,

18-17318 2/2 

 

 Convinced that such measures could critically improve conditions for efficiently 

addressing the threat of an arms race in outer space, including the placement of 

weapons in outer space, 

 Welcoming, in this regard, the draft treaty on the prevention of the placement of 

weapons in outer space and of the threat or use of force against outer space objects, 

introduced by China and the Russian Federation at the Conference on Disarmament 

in 2008,2 and the submission of its updated version in 2014,3  

 Considering that transparency and confidence-building measures in outer space 

activities are an integral part of the draft treaty referred to above,  

 Recalling its resolutions 69/32 of 2 December 2014, 70/27 of 7 December 2015, 

71/32 of 5 December 2016 and 72/27 of 4 December 2017, and its resolutions 45/55 B 

of 4 December 1990 and 48/74 B of 16 December 1993, which, inter alia, confirm the 

importance of transparency and confidence-building measures as a means conducive 

to ensuring the attainment of the objective of preventing an arms race in outer space, 

 Noting the importance of the political statements made by a number of Sta tes4 

that they would not be the first to place weapons in outer space,  

 1. Reaffirms the importance and urgency of the objective of preventing an 

arms race in outer space and the willingness of States to contribute to reaching this 

common goal; 

 2. Reiterates that the Conference on Disarmament, as the single multilateral 

negotiating forum on this subject, 5  has the primary role in the negotiation of a 

multilateral agreement, or agreements, as appropriate, on the prevention of an arms 

race in outer space in all its aspects; 

 3. Urges an early commencement of substantive work based on the updated 

draft treaty on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space and of the 

threat or use of force against outer space objects,3 introduced by China and the 

Russian Federation at the Conference on Disarmament in 2008, 2 under the agenda 

item entitled “Prevention of an arms race in outer space”; 

 4. Stresses that, while such an agreement is not yet concluded, other measures 

may contribute to ensuring that weapons are not placed in outer space;  

 5. Encourages all States, especially spacefaring nations, to consider the 

possibility of upholding, as appropriate, a political commitment not to be the first to 

place weapons in outer space; 

 6. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-fourth session, 

under the item entitled “Prevention of an arms race in outer space”, the sub-item 

entitled “No first placement of weapons in outer space”.
