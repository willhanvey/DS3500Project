 Welcoming UNMIL’s deployments in vulnerable areas at Liberia’s borders, 

 Reiterating the continuing need for UNMIL’s support for the security of the

architecture and encourages the international community to support these efforts; 

 6. Welcomes the efforts undertaken by UNMIL to implement the Secretary-
General’s zero tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and to ensure full 
compliance of its personnel with the United Nations code of conduct, and requests 
the Secretary-General to take all necessary action in this regard and to keep the 
Security Council informed, and urges troop-contributing countries to take 
appropriate preventive action, including the conduct of predeployment awareness 
training, and to take disciplinary and other action to ensure that allegations of sexual 
exploitation or abuse against their personnel are properly investigated and, if
