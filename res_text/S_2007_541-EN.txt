  Draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its resolution 1504 (2003) of 4 September 2003, 

 Having regard to Article 16 (4) of the Statute of the International Criminal 
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, 

 Aware that the term of office for Ms. Carla Del Ponte as Prosecutor for the 
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia expires on 14 September 
2007, 

 Noting the need to ensure a smooth transition between the departure of 
Ms. Carla Del Ponte and the assumption of office of her successor, 

 Having considered the request of the Secretary-General to extend the 
appointment of Ms. Del Ponte from 15 September 2007 to 31 December 2007 
(S/2007/538), 

 Noting the intention of the Secretary-General to submit the name of his 
nominee for the position of Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the 
former Yugoslavia, 

 Decides, notwithstanding the provisions of article 16 (4) of the Statute, to 
extend for a final period the appointment of Ms. Carla Del Ponte as Prosecutor of 
the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia with effect from 
15 September 2007 until 31 December 2007.
