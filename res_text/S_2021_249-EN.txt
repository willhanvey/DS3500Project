on Development (IGAD) in advancing the peace process for South Sudan and 

welcoming the commitment and efforts of IGAD and its member states, the

parties that violate the ACOH must be held accountable,

in some parts of South Sudan, which has killed and displaced thousands, and 

condemning the mobilization of such groups by parties to the conflict, including by 

members of government forces and armed opposition groups, 

 Expressing grave concern at ongoing reports of sexual and gender-based 

violence, including the findings of the report of the Secretary-General on Conflict-

Related Sexual Violence to the Security Council (S/2020/487) of the use of sexual 

violence as a tactic by parties to the conflict against the civilian population in South 

Sudan, including use of rape, sexual slavery and sexual torture for the purpose of 

intimidation and punishment, based on perceived political affiliation, and employed 

as part of a strategy targeting members of ethnic groups, and where conflict -related 

sexual violence and other forms of violence against women and girls has persisted 

after the signing of the Revitalised Agreement, as documented in the May 2020 report 

published by the United Nations Mission in the Republic of South Sudan (UNMISS) 

and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 

(OHCHR) on “Access to Health for Survivors of Conflict-Related Sexual Violence in 

South Sudan”, noting that some progress was observed by South Sudanese parties

underlining the urgency and importance of timely investigations to support 

accountability and the provision of assistance and protection to survivors and victims 

of sexual and gender-based violence, 

 Alarmed by the dire humanitarian situation, the high levels of food insecurity in 

the country and likely famine in some areas, recalling its resolution 2417 (2018) that 

recognizes the need to break the vicious cycle between armed conflict and food 

insecurity, condemning attacks on the means of livelihood and intentional denial of 

access to food, which could amount to war crimes, further condemning the 

obstructions by all parties to civilians’ movement and to humanitarian actors’ 

movement to reach civilians in need of assistance, expressing concern at the 

imposition of taxes and fees which hamper the delivery of humanitarian assistance 

across the country, noting with concern reports that forced displacement and denial 

of humanitarian access is exacerbating food insecurity for the civilian population,  

 Expressing serious and urgent concern over the nearly 3.8 million displaced 

persons and ongoing humanitarian crisis, 8.3 million in need of humanitarian 

assistance according to the 2021 South Sudan Humanitarian Needs Overview, and the

humanitarian personnel and journalists, emphasizing that those responsible for 

violations of international humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human 

rights must be held accountable, and that South Sudan’s government bears the primary 

responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, 

and crimes against humanity, and expressing concern that despite the signing of the 

Revitalised Agreement, violations and abuses including rape and sexual violence 

continue to occur which may amount to international crimes, including war crimes 

and crimes against humanity, 

 Expressing grave concern regarding the reports on the human rights situation in 

South Sudan issued by UNMISS and the Secretary-General, further expressing grave 

concern that according to the AU Commission of Inquiry report on South Sudan,

and 19 February 2021 war crimes and crimes against humanity may have been 

committed, emphasizing its expectation that these and other credible reports will be 

duly considered by any transitional justice mechanisms for South Sudan including 

those established pursuant to the Revitalised Agreement, stressing the importance of 

collection and preservation of evidence for eventual use by the Hybrid Court for South

justice all those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law and 

violations and abuses of human rights, stressing the importance of transitional justice 

measures, including those in the Revitalised Agreement, to end impunity and promote 

accountability, facilitate national reconciliation and healing, and ensure a sustainable 

peace, as recognized by Chapter V in the Revitalised Agreement, and in this regard, 

recognizing the operationalization of a Gender-Based Violence and Juvenile Court by 

the Judiciary of South Sudan, further recognizing the steps taken by the African Union 

to establish the Hybrid Court for South Sudan, as well as the work done to date by 

the UN, and acknowledging the approval by the Government of South Sudan (GoSS) 

to establish transitional justice mechanisms, including the Hybrid Court for South 

Sudan, 

 Strongly condemning the continued obstruction of UNMISS by the GoSS and 

opposition groups, including restrictions on freedom of movement, assault of 

UNMISS personnel, and constraints on mission operations, including restrictions on 

patrols and UNMISS efforts to, inter alia, monitor human rights conditions, many of 

which were reported by the Secretary-General as violations of the Status of Forces 

Agreement (SOFA) by the GoSS, and recalling that, according to the SOFA, 

UNMISS, as well as its contractors, shall enjoy full and unrestricted freedom of 

movement without delay throughout South Sudan by the most direct route possible 

without the need for travel permits or prior authorization or notification, and the right 

to import equipment, provisions, supplies, fuel, materials, and other goods free of

policies that threaten the peace, security or stability of South Sudan, may be 

designated for targeted sanctions, further recalling its willingness to impose targeted 

sanctions, and stressing the critical importance of effective implementation of the 

sanctions regime, including its travel ban measures, and the key role that neighboring 

states, as well as regional and subregional organizations, can play in this regard, 

encouraging efforts to further enhance cooperation, and reiterating its readiness to 

consider adjusting measures, including through modifying, suspending, lifting or

 Emphasizing that persistent barriers to full implementation of resolution 1325 

(2000), and subsequent resolutions addressing women, peace, and security, including 

resolution 2242 (2015), will only be dismantled through dedicated commitment to 

women’s empowerment, participation, and human rights, concerted leadership, 

consistent information and action, and support, to build women’s full, equal, and 

meaningful participation in all levels of decision-making,

expression and, in this context, expressing deep concern that violations and abuses of 

the right to freedom of opinion and expression continue to occur, and condemning the
