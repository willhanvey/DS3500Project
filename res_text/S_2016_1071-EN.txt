 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 

territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic,  

 Alarmed by the continued deterioration of the devastating humanitarian 

situation in Aleppo and by the fact that urgent humanitarian evacuations and

international humanitarian law and principles and emphasizes that the evacuations 

of civilians must be voluntary and to final destinations of their choice, and

be evacuated and those who opt to remain in their homes;  

 3. Requests the United Nations and other relevant institutions to carry out 

adequate, neutral monitoring and direct observation on evacuations from the eastern 

districts of Aleppo and other districts of the city, and to report as appropriate

demands all parties to provide these monitors with safe, immediate and unimpeded 

access; 

 4. Stresses the importance to ensure the voluntary, safe and dignified 

passage of all civilians from the eastern districts of Aleppo or other areas, under the 

monitoring of and coordination by the United Nations and other relevant

priority should be given to the most seriously wounded people and the most 

vulnerable and calls on all the parties to cooperate with the United Nations in this 

regard;
