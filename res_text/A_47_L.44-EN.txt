Noting that the monitoring and enforcement mechanism of the mandatory
sanctions imposed by the Security Council on South Africa in its resolution
418 (1977) of 4 November 1977 would benefit from further strengthening,

Reiterating that the full implementation of the mandatory arms embargo
against South Africa is an essential element of international action towards
the eradication of apartheid,

Convinced that sanctions and other restrictive measures have had a
significant impact on recent developments in South Africa and that the phased
application of appropriate pressure remains an effective and necessary
instrument in the process towards the peaceful end to apartheid,

Taking note of the report of the Director-General of the International
Atomic Energy Agency of 4 September 1992 relating to the inspection of South
Africa's nuclear facilities under the terms of its safeguards agreement, i/

Expressing serious concern about the continued violations of the
mandatory arms embargo, particularly by those countries which surreptitiously
trade in arms with South Africa,

Expressing concern that South Africa's external military relations,
especially in the area of military technology and, in particular, in the
production and testing of missiles, continue unabated, as mentioned in the
report of the Special Committee against Apartheid,

Gravely concerned about the practice carried out by certain oil-producing
States whereby oil is exchanged for South African arms,

1. Deplores the actions of those States which, directly or indirectly,
continue to violate the mandatory arms embargo and collaborate with South
Africa in the military, nuclear, intelligence and technology fields, and calls
upon those States to terminate forthwith any illegal acts and honour their
obligations under Security Council resolution 418 (1977);

2. Urges all States to adopt strict legislation relating to the
implementation of the arms embargo and prohibit the supply to South Africa of
nuclear and military products, as well as computer and communications
equipment, technological skills and services, including military intelligence,
destined for use by the military, police and security agencies of that
country, until free and fair elections have been held and a democratic
government has been established;

3. Urges the Security Council to consider immediate steps to ensure the
full implementation and the effective monitoring of the arms embargo imposed
by the Council in its resolutions 418 (1977) and 558 (1984) of

i/ A/47/533, annex 11.

13 December 1984, to implement the recomme~dations of the Committee
established under Council resolution 421 (1977) concerning appropriate
measures in response to violations of the mandatory arms embargo and to
provide information on a regular basis to the Secretary-General for general
distribution to Member States;

4. Calls upon all States to maintain existing financial measures, and,
in particular, urges Governments and private financial institutions, as well
as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, not to extend new loans
and credits to South A.frica, whether to the public or private sector, until
agreement has been reached on a non-racial democratic constitution or until
specific recommendations are made on this matter by the transitional
authorities to be established by the Convention for a Democratic South Africa;

5. Requests the Special Committe against Apartheid to keep the issue of
military and nuclear collaboration with South Africa under constant review and
to report thereon to the General Assembly and the Security Council as
appropriate.
