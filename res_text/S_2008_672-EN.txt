 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions and the statements of its President relating to 
the situation in Côte d’Ivoire, in particular resolutions 1782 (2007) and 1826 (2008), 

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial 
integrity and unity of Côte d’Ivoire, and recalling the importance of the principles of 
good-neighbourliness, non-interference and regional cooperation, 

 Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General dated 14 October 2008 
(S/2008/645) and of the reports of the United Nations Group of Experts on Côte 
d’Ivoire dated 14 April 2008 (S/2008/235) and 15 October 2008 (S/2008/598), 

 Emphasizing the continued contribution to Côte d’Ivoire’s stability, in 
particular in the context of the forthcoming presidential elections, of the measures 
imposed by resolution 1572 (2004) and 1643 (2005), 

 Recalling that in its resolution 1782 (2007), it welcomed the initial measures 
to implement the Ouagadougou Political Agreement and recalling also that in its 
resolution 1826 (2008) it encouraged in particular the Ivorian parties to remove the 
remaining logistical obstacles that impeded the identification of the population and 
the registration of voters, 

 Welcoming in this regard the official launching of the identification and 
registration of voters operations on 15 September 2008 and urging the Ivorian 
parties to take all the necessary steps to complete these operations, 

 Noting again with concern, in spite of the sustained improvement of the 
overall human rights situation, the persistence of cases of human rights violations 
against civilians, including numerous acts of sexual violence, stressing that the 
perpetrators must be brought to justice, reiterating its firm condemnation of all 
violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Côte d’Ivoire, and 
recalling its resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) on women, peace and 
security, its resolution 1612 (2005) on children and armed conflict and its resolution 
1674 (2006) on the protection of civilians in armed conflict, 

 Recalling that the Committee established by paragraph 14 of resolution 1572 
(2004) (the Committee) will consider and decide upon requests for the exemptions 
set out in paragraphs 8, 10 and 12 of resolution 1572 (2004) which are submitted in
