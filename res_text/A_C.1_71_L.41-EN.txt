16-17871 2/4 

 

 Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration,
3
 in which it is stated, 

inter alia, that responsibility for managing worldwide economic and social 

development, as well as threats to international peace and security, must be shared 

among the nations of the world and should be exercised multilaterally and that, as 

the most universal and most representative organization in the world, the United 

Nations must play the central role,  

 Welcoming the efforts by Member States to secure progress in multilateral 

disarmament and the support of the Secretary-General for such efforts, and recalling 

in this regard the Secretary-General’s five-point proposal on nuclear disarmament,  

 Recalling that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,
4
 which 

serves as the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime, 

was negotiated considering the devastation that would be visited upon all mankind  

by a nuclear war and the consequent need to make every effort to avert the danger 

of such a war and to take measures to safeguard the security of peoples,  

 Recalling also the obligations of States parties to the Treaty and their 

commitments as reflected in the outcome documents of the 1995 Review and Extension 

Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,
5
 

of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty
6
 and of the 2010 Review 

Conference of the Parties to the Treaty,
7
  

 Stressing the importance of the full and effective implementation by the States 

parties to the Treaty of the various commitments made at the review conferences, 

 Reaffirming the absolute validity of multilateral diplomacy in the field of 

disarmament and non-proliferation, and determined to promote multilateralism as an 

essential way to develop arms regulation and disarmament negotiations,  

 Mindful of the absence of concrete outcomes of multilateral nuclear 

disarmament negotiations within the United Nations framework for two decades, 

and mindful also of the obligation of States to engage in negotiations in good faith 

on effective measures towards nuclear disarmament, 

 Recognizing that the current international climate makes increased political 

attention to disarmament and non-proliferation issues, the promotion of multilateral 

disarmament and the achievement of a world without nuclear weapons all t he more 

urgent, 

 Welcoming the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on nuclear disarmament, 

held on 26 September 2013 pursuant to its resolution 67/39 of 3 December 2012,  

which highlighted the wish of the international community for progress in this field, 

and noting its resolution 68/32 of 5 December 2013 as a follow-up to this meeting,

 Welcoming also the report on the work of the Open-ended Working Group to 

develop proposals to take forward multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations for 

the achievement and maintenance of a world without nuclear weapons, submitted 

pursuant to its resolution 67/56

resolution 68/46,
9
 containing the views of Member States on how to take forward 

multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations, including the steps that Member 

States have already taken to that end,  

 Welcoming further the efforts by all Member States, international organizations 

and civil society to continue to enrich the discussions on how to take forward 

multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations in the United Nations bodies in which 

disarmament and peace and security are addressed,  

 Bearing in mind that a legally binding instrument prohibiting nuclear weapons 

would be an important contribution towards comprehensive nuclear disarmament,  

 Bearing in mind also that additional measures, both practical and legally 

binding, for the irreversible, verifiable and transparent destruction of nuclear 

weapons would be needed in order to achieve and maintain a world without nuclear 

weapons, 

 Stressing the importance of inclusiveness, and welcoming the participation of 

all Member States in the efforts to achieve a nuclear -weapon-free world, 

 Emphasizing the importance and urgency of securing substantive progress on 

priority nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation issues, 

 Mindful of Article 11 of the Charter of the United Nations concerning the 

functions and powers of the General Assembly to consider and make 

recommendations with regard to, inter alia, disarmament,  

 1. Notes with satisfaction that the Open-ended Working Group taking 

forward multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations, established by the General 

Assembly by its resolution 70/33, which met in Geneva during 2016, engaged in 

structured and substantive discussions in a comprehensive, inclusive, interactive and 

constructive manner; 

 2. Welcomes the report of the Working Group established by the General 

Assembly by its resolution 70/33;
10

nuclear disarmament negotiations remains the achievement and maintenance of a 

world without nuclear weapons, and emphasizes the importance of addressing issues

manner, for the advancement of multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations;

various measures suggested in the report of the Working Group that could contribute 

to taking forward multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations, including  but not 

limited to transparency measures related to the risks associated with existing nuclear 

weapons, measures to reduce and eliminate the risk of accidental, mistaken, 

unauthorized or intentional nuclear weapon detonations, additional measures to 

increase awareness and understanding of the complexity of and interrelationship 

between the wide range of humanitarian consequences that would result from any 

nuclear detonation and other measures that could contribute to taking forward 

multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations;
