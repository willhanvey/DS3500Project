concerned that the secretary-General is continuing to face growing 
difficulties in meeting the obligations of the United Nations Interim Force in 
Lebanon on a current basis, particularly those due to the Governments of 
troop-contributing States, 

Recalling its resolutions 34/9 E of 17 December 1979, 35/115 B of 
10 December 1980 and 36/138 B of 16 December 1981, 

Recognizing that, in consequence of the withholding of contributions ~ 
certain Member States, the surplus balances in the Special Account for the United 
Nations Interim FOrce in Lebanon have, in effect, been drawn upon to the full 
extent to supplement the income received from contributions for meeting expenses of 
the Force, 

Concerned that the application of the provisions of regulations 5.2 (b), 
5.2 (d), 4.3 and 4.4 of the Financial Regulations of the United Nations would 
aggravate the already difficult financial situation of the United Nations Interim 
Force in Lebanon,

the Financial Regulations of the united Nations shall be suspended in respect of

those provisions, this amount to be entered in the account referred to in the 
operative part of General Assembly resolution 34/9 E and held in suspense until a 
further decision is taken by the Assembly.
