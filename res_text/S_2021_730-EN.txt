 Underscoring the importance of peacekeeping as one of the most effective tools 

available to the United Nations in the promotion and maintenance of international

 Noting efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General to mobilize all partners and

 Noting that United Nations personnel serving in peacekeeping operations are 

deployed in deteriorating and complex political and security environments, 

expressing grave concern about the security threats and targeted attacks against 

United Nations personnel serving in peacekeeping operations, which constitute a 

major challenge to United Nations operations, including threats posed by landmines, 

explosive remnants of war (ERW) and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and 

recalling the sacrifices of uniformed and civilian personnel in implementing United 

Nations mandates in challenging environments,  

 Condemning in the strongest terms the killing of, and all acts of violence against

 Condemning violations of status-of-forces or status-of-mission agreements by 

any party to those agreements, recognizing the grave risks such violations can present

perpetrators of the killing of, and all acts of violence against United Nations perso nnel

expressed by Member States to take all appropriate measures to bring to justice 

perpetrators of such acts against United Nations personnel serving in peacekeeping

rule of law and security sector reform efforts, including in dedicating national 

resources towards national police, justice and corrections institutions, and monitoring 

the impact of police, justice and corrections reform, and recognizing that the political 

leadership and political will of national authorities are critical in this regard and 

success necessitates national ownership,

peacekeeping operations in the promotion and maintenance of international peace and 

security in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, and that the primar y 

responsibility for the safety and security of United Nations personnel and assets rests
