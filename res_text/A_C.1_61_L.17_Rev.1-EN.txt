  Sierra Leone: revised draft resolution 
 
 

  Declaration of a fourth disarmament decade 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions on arms control, disarmament and 
non-proliferation, in particular those relating to its declaration of the First, Second 
and Third Disarmament Decades,1 

 Reaffirming the validity of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of 
the General Assembly, the first special session devoted to disarmament,2 

 Recalling also the conclusion of the Secretary-General in his latest report to 
the General Assembly on the work of the Organization, inter alia, that if ever there 
was a time to break the deadlock in multilateral negotiations and bring disarmament 
back into the limelight of the international agenda, it is now,3 

 Seriously concerned at the current disarmament, non-proliferation and 
international security climate, 

 Recognizing the urgent need to mobilize concerted and more intensive global 
efforts to reverse the current trend in the field of arms control, disarmament and 
non-proliferation, including, where appropriate, indicative targets for accelerating 
attainment of the objectives of general and complete disarmament under effective 
international control, 

 Conscious of the role that a fourth disarmament decade could play in the 
mobilization of such global efforts to meet current and emerging challenges in the 
area of arms control, disarmament, non-proliferation and international security, 

 Directs the Disarmament Commission, at its 2009 substantive session, to 
prepare elements of a draft “Declaration of the 2010s as the Fourth Disarmament 
Decade” and to submit them to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session for 
its consideration.
