3 07-65058

 Recognizing the tasks and arrangements set out in letters annexed to resolution

Annex I 
 

  Letter dated 7 December 2007 from the Prime Minister of Iraq 
addressed to the President of the Security Council 
 
 

[Original: Arabic and English] 

 Iraq has now finished building its constitutional and legal institutions. It now 
has a permanent constitution, which was voted on by the Iraqi people, and a 
parliament, which represents the various components of Iraqi society. Iraq also has a 
Government of national unity that includes all political factions. Today, despite the 
efforts of terrorists and hostile forces to prevent us from developing our young and 
vital democracy, we are determined to build a democratic, federal and unified Iraq. 

 The Government of Iraq continues to act expeditiously to guarantee the 
security of Iraqi citizens and the stability of the country. It is continuing to act 
expeditiously to promote national reconciliation in order to ensure broad political 
participation by all national forces, to protect human rights and strengthen the rule 
of law, to achieve economic growth and to provide its citizens with basic services. 

 Achieving security and stability in the country is a matter of the utmost 
priority for the Iraqi Government. That is why it has devoted special attention to the 
task of building and strengthening the capacities of the Iraqi Army and the internal 
security forces, given that those are the two institutions that can guarantee security, 
maintain order and confront terrorist and other outlaw groups. Our national forces 
have successfully taken over the security functions of the multinational force in Iraq 
(MNF-I) in eight governorates. It is our intention that our national forces will 
continue to take over those security functions until all 18 governorates are under the 
full security control of our troops in 2008. Our ground force command has assumed 
control of all the divisions of the Iraqi Army. The effective coordination between the 
command and MNF-I has had a positive effect on the security situation. 

 The Government of Iraq stresses that MNF-I, working alongside our national 
forces, has made an important and significant contribution to efforts to establish 
security and the rule of law. The Government of Iraq requests that the Security 
Council should consider extending the mandate of MNF-I in light of Iraq’s 
achievements over the past few years, namely, the strengthened capacity of its Army 
and security forces and its significant successes in the security, political and 
economic spheres. A review of the role and authority of MNF-I will thus be required 
in order to strike a balance between, on the one hand, the need to extend, one last 
time, the mandate of the force and, on the other hand, progress made by Iraq in the 
area of security. In this regard, it is important for Iraq to be treated as an 
independent and fully sovereign State and, in seeking the aforementioned balance, 
the following objectives should be highlighted: 

1. The Government of Iraq requests the extension of the mandate of MNF-I in 
accordance with Security Council resolutions 1546 (2004), 1637 (2005) and 
1723 (2006) and the letters annexed thereto for a period of 12 months 
beginning on 31 December 2007, provided that the extension is subject to a 
commitment by the Security Council to end the mandate at an earlier date if 
the Government of Iraq so requests and that the mandate is subject to periodic 
review before June 2008; 



S/2007/738  
 

07-65058 6 
 

2. The functions of recruiting, training, arming and equipping the Iraqi Army and 
Iraq’s security forces are the responsibility of the Government of Iraq; 

3. The Government of Iraq will assume responsibility for command and control 
of all Iraqi forces, and MNF-I, in coordination with the Government of Iraq, 
will provide support and backing to those forces; 

4. The Government of Iraq will be responsible for arrest, detention and 
imprisonment tasks. When those tasks are carried out by MNF-I, there will be 
maximum levels of coordination, cooperation and understanding with the 
Government of Iraq; 

5. The Government of Iraq considers this to be its final request to the Security 
Council for the extension of the mandate of MNF-I and expects, in future, that 
the Security Council will be able to deal with the situation in Iraq without the 
need for action under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; 

6. The Government of Iraq requests that the resolution to be adopted by the 
Security Council should reaffirm respect for the independence, sovereignty, 
unity and territorial integrity of Iraq and also reaffirm the commitment of 
Member States to the principle of non-intervention in its internal affairs. 

 The Government of Iraq wishes to inform the Security Council that it has 
signed a declaration of principles with the United States of America with a view to 
establishing a long-term cooperative and friendly relationship. 

 The Government of Iraq reaffirms the importance of the work of the Security 
Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1518 (2003) in order to 
restore the Iraqi funds and assets deposited outside Iraq by the previous regime. The 
Government of Iraq urges the members of the Security Council to support the 
Committee’s ongoing work in accordance with paragraph 19 of resolution 1483 
(2003) concerning the identification of individuals and entities referred to in 
paragraph 23 of that resolution, including the updating of the list of individuals and 
entities identified by the Committee established pursuant to paragraph 6 of 
resolution 661 (1990). The Government of Iraq looks forward to the Committee’s 
report to the Security Council on its activities. 

 The Government of Iraq recognizes the importance of the provisions of 
paragraph 22 of resolution 1483 (2003) in ensuring that Iraq’s natural resources, the 
proceeds from sales thereof and other funds deposited in the Development Fund for 
Iraq are used for reconstruction activities and other efforts to benefit the people of 
Iraq. Iraq therefore requests that, taking account of the exception provided for in 
paragraph 27 of resolution 1546 (2004), the Security Council should continue to 
apply the provisions of paragraph 22 of resolution 1483 (2003) until 
31 December 2008, including in respect of the funds, financial assets and economic 
resources described in paragraph 23 of resolution 1483 (2003). 

 The Government of Iraq is of the opinion that the provisions of Security 
Council resolution 1546 (2004) on the deposit of proceeds into the Development 
Fund for Iraq will help to ensure that proceeds from Iraq’s natural resources are 
used to serve the interests of the Iraqi people. The role played by the International 
Advisory and Monitoring Board serves the same purpose. The Government of Iraq 
understands that the Development Fund for Iraq plays an important role in helping 
Iraq to convince donors and creditors that it is managing its resources and debts in a 



 S/2007/738
 

7 07-65058 
 

responsible way in the interests of the Iraqi people. It should be pointed out that Iraq 
is striving to form a new partnership with the international community in order to 
build a dynamic network designed to transform its economy and integrate it with 
other world economies through the International Compact with Iraq. We are 
therefore requesting that the mandate of the Development Fund for Iraq and the 
International Advisory and Monitoring Board be extended for a further 12 months. 
We are also requesting that the mandate should be reviewed, based on the request of 
the Iraqi Government, before 15 June 2008.  

 The Government of Iraq is asking the Security Council to review its 
resolutions relating to the deposit of 5 per cent of Iraq’s proceeds from oil into the 
Compensation Fund established in accordance with Security Council resolution 687 
(1991) and subsequent relevant resolutions, with a view to reducing that percentage 
as much as possible, since the deposit of such a high percentage creates a financial 
burden for Iraq at a time when it is in dire need of those funds to rebuild its 
infrastructure, which was destroyed during the wars waged by the previous regime. 
Furthermore, the increase in the price of oil means that the real amount represented 
by that 5 per cent is at least five times greater than it was. 

 The people of Iraq are determined to establish a stable and peaceful 
democracy. They are determined to develop a dynamic economy built on solid 
foundations and a creative vision. The people of Iraq need the support of the 
international community to make that vision a reality. 

 It is our understanding that the Security Council intends to include this letter 
as an annex to the resolution concerning Iraq that is currently being drafted. In the 
meantime, I should be grateful if you would have this letter circulated to the 
members of the esteemed Security Council as soon as possible.

Annex II 
 

  Letter dated 10 December 2007 from the Secretary of State of the 
United States of America to the President of the Security Council 
 
 

 Having reviewed the request of the Government of Iraq to extend the mandate 
of the Multinational Force (MNF) in Iraq and following consultations with the 
Government of Iraq, I am writing to confirm, consistent with this request, that the 
MNF under unified command stands ready to continue to fulfil its mandate as set 
out in Security Council resolution 1546 (2004) and extended by Security Council 
resolutions 1637 (2005) and 1723 (2006). 

 Together, the Government of Iraq and MNF in Iraq combat the challenges that 
threaten Iraq’s security and stability through a security partnership that has 
continued to improve and that has resulted in progress in the past year. This 
effective, cooperative partnership continues to evolve, as Iraqi security forces take 
leadership in fighting and deterring terrorism and other violent acts throughout Iraq. 
In the context of this partnership, MNF is prepared to continue to undertake a broad 
range of tasks to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability and to 
ensure force protection, acting under the authorities set forth in resolution 1546 
(2004), including the tasks and arrangements set out in the letters annexed thereto, 
and in close cooperation with the Government of Iraq. The forces that make up 
MNF will remain committed to acting consistently with their obligations and rights 
under international law, including the law of armed conflict. 

 Iraqi security forces continue to make progress in developing their capabilities 
as they move into the lead in taking responsibility for Iraq’s security. This year, the 
Iraqi Ground Forces Command has assumed control of all Iraqi Army divisions. 
Iraqi authorities and local security forces have assumed primary security 
responsibility in eight of Iraq’s provinces, and we are working together for 
continued progress in transition of security responsibility in all of Iraq’s eighteen 
provinces. Together we will build towards the day when the Iraqi forces assume full 
responsibility for the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq. 

 In the coming year, the MNF is ready to continue to participate in the 
maintenance of security and stability in Iraq, within the context of the growth in the 
capabilities of the Iraqi Security Forces and Iraq’s successes in security, politics, 
and the economy. The MNF is prepared to work with the Government of Iraq to help 
it achieve the objectives it has set for itself as an independent and sovereign state. 

 The co-sponsors intend to annex this letter to the resolution on Iraq that is 
under consideration. In the meantime, I request that you provide copies of this letter 
to members of the Council as quickly as possible.
