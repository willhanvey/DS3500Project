 Noting the approaching commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the 
adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action in September 2011, 

 Underlining the fact that the commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the 
adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action represents an 
important opportunity for the international community to reaffirm its commitment to 
the eradication of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 
and encouraging States and communities to commemorate the tenth year anniversary 
in all regions through a wide range of activities,  

 Recalling all of the relevant resolutions and decisions of the Commission on 
Human Rights and of the Human Rights Council on this subject, and calling for 
their implementation to ensure the successful implementation of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action, 

 Noting Human Rights Council decision 3/103 of 8 December 2006,2 by which, 
heeding the decision and instruction of the World Conference, the Council 
established the Ad Hoc Committee of the Human Rights Council on the Elaboration 
of Complementary Standards, and deeply regretting the slow progress made in 
discharging its mandate, 

 Bearing in mind the responsibility and obligations of the Human Rights 
Council emanating from the outcome of the Durban Review Conference,3 

 Reiterating that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights 
and have the potential to contribute constructively to the development and well-
being of their societies, and that any doctrine of racial superiority is scientifically 
false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and must be rejected, 
together with theories that attempt to determine the existence of separate human 
races, 

 Convinced that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance manifest themselves in a differentiated manner for women and girls and 
may be among the factors leading to a deterioration in their living conditions, 
poverty, violence, multiple forms of discrimination and the limitation or denial of 
their human rights, and recognizing the need to integrate a gender perspective into 
relevant policies, strategies and programmes of action against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in order to address multiple 
forms of discrimination, 

 Underlining the primacy of political will, international cooperation and 
adequate funding at the national, regional and international levels needed to address 
all forms and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance, 

 Expressing serious concern at recent actions taken by some Member States to 
deport the Roma, which is a vulnerable ethnic minority, and urging States to fully 
implement their commitments and obligations under international law and relevant 
international human rights instruments,

 Expressing concern at recent deeply marked tendencies within numerous 
societies to characterize migration as a problem and threat to social cohesion,  

 Alarmed at the increase in racist violence and xenophobic ideas in many parts 
of the world, in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in society at 
large, inter alia, as a result of the resurgent activities of associations established on 
the basis of racist and xenophobic platforms and charters, and the persistent use of 
those platforms and charters to promote or incite racist ideologies, 

 Underlining the importance of urgently eliminating continuing and violent 
trends involving racism and racial discrimination, and conscious that any form of 
impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in 
weakening the rule of law and democracy, tends to encourage the recurrence of such 
crimes and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication, 

 Expressing grave concern at the lack of progress made in the implementation 
of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, particularly key paragraphs 
157 to 159 of the Programme of Action, 

 Welcoming the continued commitment of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to profile and increase the visibility of the struggle 
against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and 
recognizing the need for the High Commissioner to make this a cross-cutting issue 
in the activities and programmes of her Office, 

 Welcoming also the conclusions and recommendations of the 
Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective Implementation of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action at its seventh and eighth sessions held from 
5 to 16 October 2009 and from 11 to 22 October 2010, respectively, in particular the 
recommendation on the commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the adoption of 
the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action,  

 Recognizing the potential of sport as a universal language contributing to 
educating people on the values of diversity, tolerance and fairness and as a means to 
combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 

 Welcoming the hosting of the 2010 and 2014 International Federation of 
Association Football World Cups in South Africa and in Brazil, respectively, and 
stressing the importance of making continuing use of these events to promote 
understanding, tolerance and peace, and to promote and strengthen efforts in the 
fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,
