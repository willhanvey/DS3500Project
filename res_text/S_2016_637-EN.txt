 The Security Council, 

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 8 July 2016 (S/2016/598) on 

the United Nations operation in Cyprus,  

 Noting that the Government of Cyprus is agreed that in view of the prevailing 

conditions on the island it is necessary to keep the United Nations Peacekeeping 

Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) beyond 31 July 2016,  

 Noting the intention of the Secretary-General to report on his Good Offices in 

the next reporting period, echoing the Secretary-General’s firm belief that the 

responsibility for finding a solution lies first and foremost with the Cypriots 

themselves, and reaffirming the primary role of the United Nations in assisting the 

parties to bring the Cyprus conflict and division of the island to a comprehensive 

and durable settlement, 

 Welcoming the commitments set out in Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot 

leaders’ Joint Statements of 15 May 2016 and 8 June 2016 on the basis of the Joint 

Declaration adopted on 11 February 2014, further welcoming the good progress i n 

negotiations since then, and the support provided by the Secretary -General’s Special 

Adviser on Cyprus Espen Barth Eide,  

 Recalling the importance attached by the international community to all 

parties engaging fully, flexibly and constructively in the negotiations and, noting 

that the negotiations have not yet resulted in an enduring, comprehensive and just 

settlement based on a bicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality, as set 

out in the relevant Security Council resolutions, encouraging the sides to intensify 

the substantive negotiations on the unresolved core issues interdependently, and 

stressing that the status quo is unsustainable, 

 Noting the need to advance the consideration of and discussions on military 

confidence building measures, calling for renewed efforts to implement all 

remaining confidence building measures, and for agreement on and implementation 

of further steps to build trust between the communities,

Cypriots, and encouraging the opening by mutual agreement of other crossing 

points,

 Convinced of the many important benefits, including economic benefits for all 

Cypriots that would flow from a comprehensive and durable Cyprus settlement, 

urging the two sides and their leaders to foster positive public rhetoric, and 

encouraging them clearly to explain the benefits of the settlement, as well as the 

need for increased flexibility and compromise in order to secure it, to both 

communities well in advance of any referenda,  

 Highlighting the importance, both political and financial, of the supporting 

role of the international community, and in particular that of all parties concerned in 

taking practical steps towards helping the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot 

leaders to exploit fully the current opportunity,  

 Taking note of the assessment of the Secretary-General that the security 

situation on the island and along the Green Line remains stable, and urging all sides 

to avoid any action, including violations of the military status quo, which could lead 

to an increase in tension, undermine the progress achieved so far, or damage the 

goodwill on the island, 

 Recalling the Secretary-General’s firm belief that the situation in the buffer 

zone would be improved if both sides accepted the 1989 aide -memoire used by the 

United Nations, 

 Noting with regret that the sides are withholding access to the remaining 

minefields in the buffer zone, and that demining in Cyprus must continue, noting the 

continued danger posed by mines in Cyprus, noting also proposals and discussions 

as well as positive initiatives on demining, and urging rapid agreement on 

facilitating the recommencement of demining operations and clearance of the 

remaining minefields, 

 Commending the work of the Committee on Missing Persons, highlighting the 

importance of intensifying its activities, and therefore the need to provide all 

information required, noting that nearly half of all missing persons have yet to be 

located and around 68% have yet to be identified, welcoming moves to allow the 

Committee access to 30 additional suspected burial sites in military areas in north 

Cyprus, urging the opening up of access to all areas expeditiously to allow the 

Committee to carry out its work, and trusting that this process will promote 

reconciliation between the communities,  

 Agreeing that active participation of civil society groups, including women’s 

groups, is essential to the political process and can contribute to making any future 

settlement sustainable, recalling that women play a critically important role in peace 

processes, welcoming all efforts to promote bicommunal contacts and events 

including, inter alia, on the part of all United Nations bodies on the island, and 

urging the two sides to promote the active engagement of civil society and the 

encouragement of cooperation between economic and commercial bodies and to 

remove all obstacles to such contacts,  

 Stressing the need for the Council to pursue a rigorous, strategic approach to 

peacekeeping deployments, 

 Welcoming the intention of the Secretary-General to keep all peacekeeping 

operations under close review to ensure efficiency and effectiveness, including a 

review of UNFICYP when appropriate, and noting the importance of transition 

planning in relation to the settlement, including recommendations as appropriate for 



 
S/2016/637

further adjustments to UNFICYP’s mandate, force levels and other resources and
