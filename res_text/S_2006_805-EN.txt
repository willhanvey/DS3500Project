  Draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous relevant resolutions, including resolution 825 (1993), 
resolution 1540 (2004) and, in particular, resolution 1695 (2006), as well as the 
statement of its President of 6 October 2006 (S/PRST/2006/41),  

 Reaffirming that proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as 
well as their means of delivery, constitutes a threat to international peace and 
security, 

 Expressing the gravest concern at the claim by the Democratic People’s 
Republic of Korea (DPRK) that it has conducted a test of a nuclear weapon on 
9 October 2006, and at the challenge such a test constitutes to the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to international efforts aimed at 
strengthening the global regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and the 
danger it poses to peace and stability in the region and beyond, 

 Expressing its firm conviction that the international regime on the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons should be maintained and recalling that the 
DPRK cannot have the status of a nuclear-weapon state in accordance with the 
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, 

 Deploring the DPRK’s announcement of withdrawal from the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its pursuit of nuclear weapons, 

 Deploring further that the DPRK has refused to return to the Six-Party talks 
without precondition, 

 Endorsing the Joint Statement issued on 19 September 2005 by China, the 
DPRK, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation and the United States, 

 Underlining the importance that the DPRK respond to other security and 
humanitarian concerns of the international community,  

 Expressing profound concern that the test claimed by the DPRK has generated 
increased tension in the region and beyond, and determining therefore that there is a 
clear threat to international peace and security, 

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, and taking 
measures under its Article 41, 



S/2006/805  
 

06-57195 2
