A/C.1/74/L.59 
 

 

19-18202 2/2 

 

 Reaffirming its recognition that the legal regime applicable to outer space by 

itself does not guarantee prevention of an arms race in outer space and that there is a 

need to consolidate and reinforce that regime,  

 Convinced that such measures could critically improve conditions for efficiently 

addressing the threat of an arms race in outer space, including the placement of 

weapons in outer space, 

 Welcoming, in this regard, the draft treaty on the prevention of the placement of 

weapons in outer space and of the threat or use of force against outer space objects, 

introduced by China and the Russian Federation at the Conference on Disarmament 

in 2008,2 and the submission of its updated version in 2014,3  

 Considering that transparency and confidence-building measures in outer space 

activities are an integral part of the draft treaty referred to above,  

 Stressing the importance of the political statements made by a number of States 4 

that they would not be the first to place weapons in outer space, 

 1. Reaffirms the importance and urgency of the objective of preventing an 

arms race in outer space and the willingness of States to contribute to reaching this 

common goal; 

 2. Reiterates that the Conference on Disarmament, as the single multilateral 

negotiating forum on this subject, 5  has the primary role in the negotiation of a 

multilateral agreement, or agreements, as appropriate, on the prevention of an arms 

race in outer space in all its aspects;  

 3. Urges an early commencement of substantive work based on the updated 

draft treaty on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space and of the 

threat or use of force against outer space objects,3 introduced by China and the 

Russian Federation at the Conference on Disarmament in 2008,2 under the agenda 

item entitled “Prevention of an arms race in outer space”; 

 4. Stresses that, while such an agreement is not yet concluded, other measures 

may contribute to ensuring that weapons are not placed in outer space;  

 5. Encourages all States, especially spacefaring nations, to consider the 

possibility of upholding, as appropriate, a political commitment not to be the first to 

place weapons in outer space; 

 6. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-fifth session, 

under the item entitled “Prevention of an arms race in outer space”, the sub-item 

entitled “No first placement of weapons in outer space”.
