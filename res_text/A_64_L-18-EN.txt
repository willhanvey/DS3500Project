of climate change on the marine environment and marine biodiversity, and 
emphasizing the urgency of addressing this issue, 

 Expressing concern that climate change continues to increase the severity and 
incidence of coral bleaching throughout tropical seas and weakens the ability of 
reefs to withstand ocean acidification, which could have serious and irreversible 
negative effects on marine organisms, particularly corals, as well as to withstand 
other pressures, including overfishing and pollution, 

 Reiterating its deep concern over the vulnerability of the environment and the 
fragile ecosystems of the polar regions, including the Arctic Ocean and the Arctic 
ice cap, particularly affected by the projected adverse effects of climate change,

critical to the safety of navigation and life at sea, environmental protection, 
including the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems, and the economics of the 
global shipping industry, and encouraging further efforts towards electronic 
charting, which not only provides significantly increased benefits for safe 
navigation and management of ship movement, but also provides data and 
information that can be used for sustainable fisheries activities and other sectoral 
uses of the marine environment, the delimitation of maritime boundaries and 
environmental protection, 

 Emphasizing that underwater archaeological, cultural and historical heritage, 
including shipwrecks and watercrafts, holds essential information on the history of 
humankind and that such heritage is a resource that needs to be protected and 
preserved,

nautical miles, as provided for in the decision of the eighteenth Meeting of States 
Parties to the Convention regarding the workload of the Commission on the Limits 
of the Continental Shelf and the ability of States, particularly developing States, to 
fulfil the requirements of article 4 of annex II to the Convention, as well as the 
decision contained in SPLOS/72, paragraph (a),9  

 Noting further that some coastal States may continue to face particular 
challenges in relation to preparing and presenting submissions to the Commission, 

 Noting that financial and technical assistance may be sought by developing 
countries for activities in relation to preparing and presenting submissions to the 
Commission, including through the voluntary trust fund established by resolution 
55/7 of 30 October 2000 for the purpose of facilitating the preparation of 
submissions to the Commission for developing States, in particular the least 
developed countries and small island developing States, and compliance with article 
76 of the Convention, as well as other accessible international assistance, 

 Recognizing the importance of the trust funds established by resolution 55/7 in 
facilitating the participation of members of the Commission from developing States 
in the meetings of the Commission and in fulfilling the requirements of article 4 of 
annex II to the Convention, while noting with appreciation the recent contributions 
made to them,  

 Reaffirming the importance of the work of the Commission for coastal States 
and for the international community, 

 Recognizing the significant workload of the Commission in view of the large 
number of submissions already received and a number of submissions yet to be 
received, placing additional demands and challenges on its members and the 
secretariat as provided by the Secretary-General of the United Nations through the 
Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea of the Office of Legal Affairs 
(“the Division”),  

 Noting with concern the projected timetable of the work of the Commission10 
on the submissions already received by it and those yet to be received and, in this 
regard, the consequences of the duration of the sessions of the Commission and the 
meetings of its subcommissions, 

 Recognizing significant inequities and difficulties for States arising out of the 
projected timetable, including with respect to retaining expertise, when there is a 
considerable delay between preparation of submissions and their consideration by 
the Commission, 

 Recognizing also the need to take action to ensure that the Commission can 
perform its functions under the Convention expeditiously, efficiently and effectively, 
and maintain its high level of quality and expertise,
