all nations,

sustained long-term economic development of individual countries and regions and 
that long-term international economic co-operation is in the interests of all 
countr}es and regions,

on the mobilization of its resources and that international economic co-operation 
is a necessary component of that development, 

Stating that an examination of the long-term trends in the economic development 
of individual regions is of great importance for securing a rapid rate of economic 
development of all countries, in particular of developing countries, and that such 
an examination will also contribute towards the elimination of the negative 
phenomena in the economies of those countries and regions,

application in the field of international economic relations, 

Considering that there are already norms and principles in the field of 
economic development that are politically relevant, legally sufficient and timely 
for consolidation, such as those contained in its resolutions 2626 (XXV) of

Convinced that there has been a long-felt need for a comprehensive code of 
economic behaviour, based on equity, sovereign equality, interdependence, common 
interest and co-operation, that should guide international economic relations, 
particularly at this time, when the world is faced with a general economic crisis 
ana. with mounting problems of under-development in most developing countries,
