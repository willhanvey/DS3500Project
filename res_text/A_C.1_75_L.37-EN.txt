  France and Germany: draft resolution 
 

 

 Fortieth anniversary of the United Nations Institute for 

Disarmament Research  
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 34/83 M of 11 December 1979, in which it requested the 

Secretary-General to establish the United Nations Institute for Disarmament 

Research, and its resolution 39/148 H of 17 December 1984, in which it approved the 

statute of the Institute, 

 Recalling also its resolutions 45/62 G of 4 December 1990, 55/35 A of 

20 November 2000, 60/89 of 8 December 2005, 65/87 of 8 December 2010 and 70/69 

of 11 December 2015 on the tenth, twentieth, twenty-fifth, thirtieth and thirty-fifth 

anniversaries of the Institute,  

 Considering the continuing need for the international community to have access 

to independent and in-depth research on security issues and prospects for 

disarmament and non-proliferation, 

 Underlining the particularly relevant contribution of the Institute to thinking 

and analysis on international security issues in the current context,  

 Recognizing the potential of the Institute, through its research, seminars, 

networks, outreach activities and publications, to assist ongoing negotiations on 

disarmament and efforts at ensuring greater international security at a progressively 

lower level of armaments and to contribute to education in this regard,  

 Welcoming the increased level of research and activity of the Institu te, the 

increase in number and range of research publications and their relevance for 

multilateral disarmament discussions, as well as the increase in range of activities,  

 Welcoming also the increased outreach and conduct of the Institute’s activities 

in Geneva and in diverse geographical locations,

 Recognizing that, despite the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the 

Institute managed to uphold its activities,  

 Reiterating its preoccupation over the unsustainable financing situation of the 

institutional operations budget of the Institute,  

 Recognizing that a viable solution to the Institute’s financial challenges will be 

instrumental for the Institute, as an autonomous institution within the framework of 

the United Nations, to fulfil Member States’ expectations to take forward its mandate 

to promote informed participation by all States in disarmament efforts, assist ongoing 

negotiations and carry out in-depth, forward-looking and long-term research on 

disarmament,  

 Recognizing also the importance of the Institute’s location in Geneva,  

 Noting the new financial and logistical difficulties that have arisen as a 

consequence of the introduction of rental costs for accommodation in the Palais des 

Nations, 

 Noting also the lack of implementation to date of the recommendations of the 

Secretary-General in his report1 on a sustainable and stable funding structure and 

operating model for the Institute that drew on the assessment by an independent third 

party requested by Member States in resolution 70/69, as well as the long-standing 

observations and recommendations of the Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters, 

the Board of Trustees of the Institute, contained in the latest report of the Secretary-

General on its work,2 

 1. Welcomes the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the United 

Nations Institute for Disarmament Research;  

 2. Recognizes the importance, the timeliness and the high quality of the work 

of the Institute;  

 3. Reiterates its conviction that the Institute should continue to conduct 

independent research on problems relating to disarmament and security and to 

undertake specialized research requiring a high degree of expertise;  

 4. Emphasizes the importance of the Institute as a stand-alone, autonomous 

institution that contributes, through its research, analysis and activities, to progress 

in disarmament and, ultimately, to a more secure world;  

 5. Underlines the contribution that the Institute makes and should continue 

to make in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation education in all regions of 

the world;  

 6. Appeals to all Member States to continue to make financial contributions 

to the Institute, if possible multi-annual, and strongly encourages them to unearmark 

these contributions so as to contribute to its viability, independence and impartiality 

and the quality of its work over the long term;  

 7. Requests the Secretary-General to continue to provide accommodation for 

the Institute in the Palais des Nations in Geneva at the reduced rate established to 

cover operational expenses only; 

 8. Invites the Secretary-General to submit, in the context of the 2022 

programme budget, a proposal for an increase in the subvention to the Institute.
