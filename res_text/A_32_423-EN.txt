"Convinced that the observance by all States of the purposes and
principles of the United Nations Charter is fUndamental for the promotion and
respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms and for the realization of
the full dignity and worth of the human person,

"Conscious that it is the duty of all Member States to achieve
international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic,
social, cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging
respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all, without
distinction as to race~ sex, language or religion,

"Convinced that such co-operation should be based on a profound
understanding of the variety of problems existing in different societies and
on the full respect for their economic, social and cultural realities,

"Bearing in mind the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

"Acknowledging the progress achieved by the international community in
the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms,
particularly, with respect to the standard-setting work within the United
Nations system,

"Noting with satisfaction the entry into force of the International
Covenants on Human Rights and of a large number of other important
international instruments in the field of human rights,

"Considering that the acceptance by Member States of the obligations
contained in said instruments is an important element for the universal
realization and respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms,

"Profoundly convinced that all human rights and fUndamental freedoms are
interrelated and indivisible,

discrimination, colonialism, foreign domination and occupation, aggression
and threats against national sovereignty, national unity and territorial
integrity, as well as the refusal to recognize the fundamental rights of all
peoples to self-determination, and of every nation to exercise full
sovereignty over its national wealth and resources constitute situations
which in themselves are and generate mass and flagrant violations of all
human rights and fundamental freedoms,

"Deeply concerned at the continuing existence of an unjust international
economic order which constitutes a major obstacle to the realization of the
economic, social and cultural rights in developing countries,

"Considering that the approach to the future work within the United
Nations system in the field of human rights should take into due account the
experiences and the general situation of, as well as the efforts made by, the
developing countries to implement human rights and fundamental freedoms,

"Considering that the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights should be marked by an over-all analysis of existing problems
in the field of human rights and by increased efforts in finding appropriate
solutions for the effective promotion and protection of human rights and
fundamental freedoms taking into account the experiences and contributions of
both developed and developing countries,

"Having considered the reports y by the Secretary-General on this item,
"1. Decides that the approach to the future work within the United

Nations system with respect to human rights questions should take into
account the following concepts:

"(a) All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and
interdependent; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to
the implementation of both civil and political, and economic, social and
cultural rights;

n(b) The full realization of civil and political rights without the
enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights is impossible, as
recognized by the Proclamation of Teheran (1968);

n(c) Consequently, human rights questions should be examined globally,
taking into account both the over-all context of the various realities in
which they present themselves, as well as the need for the promotion of the
full dignity of the human person and the development of the society;

n(d) In this revaluation of the approach to human rights within the
United Nations system, the international community should accord priority to
the search of solutions to the mass and flagrant violations of human rights

forms of racial discrimination, colonialism, foreign domination and
occupation, aggression and threats against national sovereignty, national
unity and territorial integrity, as well as of the refusal to recognize the
fundamental rights of peoples to self-determination, and of every nation to
exercise full sovereignty over its wealth and natural resources;

"(e) The implementation of the New International Economic Order is an
essential element for the effective promotion of human rights and fundamental
freedoms and should also be accorded priority;

"(f) It is of paramount importance for the promotion of human rights and
fundamental freedoms that Member States undertake specific obligations
through accession or ratification of international instruments in this field.
Consequently, the standard-setting work within the United Nations system in
the field of human rights and the universal acceptance and implementation of
the relevant international instruments should be encouraged;

"(g) The experience and contribution of both developed and developing
countries should be taken into account by all organs of the United Nations
system in their work related to human rights and fundamental freedoms;

"2. Requests the Commission on Human Rights:

'I(a) To undertake, as a matter of priority at its thirty-fourth session

the United Nations system for improving the effective enjoyment of human
rights and fundamental freedoms, in the light of the above concepts;

report with its conclusions and recommendations on the work done with respect
to (a) and (b) above, and to present a progress report to the General

24. The Third Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the
following draft resolution:

Alternative approaches and ways and means within the United Nations
system for improving the effective enjoyment of hl~an rights and

fundamental freedoms

The General Assembly,

Convinced that the obligation of all States to observe the purposes and
principles of the Charter of the United Nations is fundamental for the promotion and
respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms and for the realization of the full
dignity and worth of the human person,

Conscious that it is the duty of the United Nations and of all Member States to
achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic,
social, cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect
for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction as to
race, sex, language or religion,

Convinced that such co-operation should be based on a profound understanding of
the variety of problems existing in different societies and on the full respect for
their economic, social and cu:tural realities,

Bearing in mind the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

Acknowledging the progress achieved by the international community in the
promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, particularly,
with respect to the standard-setting work within the United Nations system,

Human Rights 11 and of a large number of other important international instruments
in the field of human rights,

Considering that the acceptance by Member States of the obligations contained
in those instruments is an important element for the universal realization and
respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms,

Recognizing that, in accordance ~ith the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and ~ant can only be
achieved if conditions are created ~hereby everyone may enjoy his economic, social
and cultural rights, as ~ell as his civil and political rights,

Profoundly convinced that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are
interrelated and indivisible,

Recognizing that apartheid, all forms of racial discrimination, colonialism,
foreign domination and occupation, aggression and threats against national
sovereignty, national unity and territorial integrity, as ~ell as the refusal to
recognize the fundamental rights of all peoples to self-determination and of every
nation to exercise full sovereignty over its natural ~ealth and resources constitute
situations ~hich in themselves are and generate mass and flagrant violations of all
human rights and fundamental freedoms of peoples as ~ell as of individuals,

Deeply concerned at the continuing existence of an unjust international
economic order ~hich constitutes a major obstacle to the realization of the
economic, social and cultural rights in developing countries,

Considering that the approach to the future ~ork ~ithin the United Nations
system in the field of human rights should take into due account the experiences
and the general situation of, as ~ell as the efforts made by, the developing
countries to implement human rights and fundamental freedoms,

Considering that the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights should be marked by an over-all analysis of existing problems in the
field of human rights and by increased efforts in finding appropriate solutions for
the effective promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms,
taking into account the experiences and contributions of both developed and
developing countries,

Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on this item, ~

1. Decides that the approach to the future ~ork ~ithin the United Nations
system ~ith respect to human rights questions should take into account the follo~ing
concepts:

(a) JUl human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and
interdependent; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the
implementation, promotion and protection of both civil and political, and economic,
social and cultural rights;

(b) The full realization of civil and political rights ~ithout the enjoyment
of economic, social and cultural rights is impossible; the achievement of lasting

progress in the implementation of human rights is dependent upon sound and effective
national and international pOlicies of economic and social development, as
recognized by the Proclamation of Teheran (1968); 21

(c) All human rights and fundamental freedoms of the human person and of
peoples are inalienable;

(d) Consequently, human rights questions should be examined globally, taking
into account both the over-all context of the various societies in which they
present themselves, as well as the need for the promotion of the full dignity of
the human person and the development and well-being of the society;

(e) In the approaching human rights questions within the United Nations
system, the international community should accord, or continue to accord, priority
to the search for solutions to the mass and flagrant violations of human rights of
peoples and persons affected by situations such as those resulting from apartheid,
from all forms of racial discrimination, from colonialism, from foreign domination
and occupation, from aggression and threats against national sovereignty, national
unity and territorial integrity, as well as from the refusal to recognize the
fundamental rights of peoples to self-determination and of every nation to the
exercise of full sovereignty over its wealth and natural resources;

(f) The realization of the new international economic order is an essential
element for the effective promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms and
should also be accorded priority;

(g) It is of paramount importance for the promotion of human rights and
fundamental freedoms that Member States undertake specific obligations through
accession to or ratification of international instruments in this field;
consequently, the standard-setting work within the United Nations system in the
field of human rights and the universal acceptance and implementation of the
relevant international instruments should be encouraged;

(h) The experience and contribution of both developed and developing countries
should be taken into account by all organs of the United Nations system in their
work related to human rights and fundamental freedoms;

2. Requests the Commission on Human Rights:

(a) To undertake at its thirty-fourth session, as a matter of priority, an
over-all analysis of the alternative approaches and ways and means within the
United Nations system for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and
fundamental freedoms in the light of the above concepts;

(b) To comply with the mandate established by the Economic and Social Council
