 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its resolutions 2286 (2016) and 2532 (2020) and General Assembly 

resolutions 74/270 and 74/274,  

 Reaffirming that combating and sustainably recovering from the coronavirus 

disease (COVID-19) pandemic requires greater national, regional, and international 

cooperation and solidarity, and a coordinated, inclusive, comprehensive and global 

international response with the United Nations (UN) playing a key role,  

 Recognising that armed conflicts can exacerbate the COVID-19 pandemic, and 

that inversely the pandemic can exacerbate the adverse humanitarian impact of armed 

conflicts, as well as exacerbating inequalities, and expressing concern that the call 

for a general and immediate cessation of hostilities contained in its resolution 2532 

(2020) was not fully heeded,  

 Recalling the obligations under the International Health Regulations (2005) and 

applicable international law,

 Emphasising the unity, common origin and solidarity of mankind, and the need 

for intensified international collaboration in the face of the common threat of 

pandemics, in particular by enabling equitable global access to quality, safe, 

efficacious and affordable diagnostics, therapeutics, medicines and vaccines, and 

essential health technologies, and their components, as well as equipment for the 

COVID-19 response, in situations of armed conflict, post-conflict situations, and 

complex humanitarian emergencies, and taking into account the need to maintain 

incentives for the development of new health products,  

 Highlighting the World Health Organisation (WHO) call that as new variants 

arise there should be increased scientific collaboration, transparency, exchange of 

information and sharing scientific knowledge including of epidemiology and genomic 

sequencing data, and equitable access to COVID-19 health products, and recognising 

in that respect the crucial role of the WHO and the importance of the Access to 

COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A), 

 Stressing that equitable access to safe, efficacious, and affordable COVID-19 

vaccines is essential to end the pandemic, noting the need to maintain incentives for 

the development of new health products, and highlighting the impediments to 

vaccination, including gaps in financing, supply, manufacturing capacity, delivery, 

logistics, and administration, as well as other such factors that could negatively affect 

vaccination efforts, in situations of armed conflict, in post-conflict situations, and 

complex humanitarian emergencies,  

 Expressing concern that progress in vaccine access has been uneven and 

recognising that those affected by conflict and insecurity are particularly at risk of 

being left behind, 

 Recognising efforts and measures proposed by the Secretary-General 

concerning the response to the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to 

conflict-affected countries, in particular his appeal for an immediate global ceasefire,  

 Recognising the role of extensive immunisation against COVID-19 as a global 

public good for health in preventing, containing, and stopping transmission, of 

COVID-19 and its variant strains, in order to bring the pandemic to an end,  

 Recognising the critical role of, and efforts made by, health workers, especially 

female health workers and other frontline and essential workers, including 

humanitarian personnel, around the world aimed at addressing the pandemic through 

measures to protect the health, safety, and well-being of people, 

 Stressing further that an effective health response to the pandemic requires 

addressing global and country-specific operational challenges such as protection of 

health workers, delays in regulatory approval, supply chain management and 

logistics, data on the provision of health-care services, as well as private sector and 

community responses, and emphasising the importance of the national vaccination 

programmes,  

 Highlighting the WHO call for measures to counter the spread of stigmatisation, 

misinformation, and disinformation, such as on COVID-19 vaccines, including 

through community engagement, and through civilian, police, and peacekeeping 

efforts in situations of armed conflict, post-conflict situations, and complex 

humanitarian emergencies,  

 Welcoming the efforts of countries that have donated to the COVID-19 Vaccine 

Global Access (COVAX) facility to provide the broadest and most equitable 

international access to the world’s neediest, as well as other donations of COVID-19 

vaccines, 



 
S/2021/171 

 

3/4 21-02814 

 

 Expressing appreciation for the continued contributions of national and 

international medical and humanitarian personnel, and commending the UN system 

especially the WHO for its key leadership role in quickly coordinating the global 

response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts of Member States therein,  

 Recognising the vital role of UN peacekeeping operations in contributing to the 

maintenance of international peace and security, expressing deep appreciation for the 

UN personnel in UN peacekeeping operations, including personnel from troop- and 

police-contributing countries, for their extraordinary efforts in the face of the 

COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences, stressing the importance of their health 

and well-being, and noting the establishment of the Group of Friends on COVID-19 

vaccines for UN uniformed personnel with the goal to develop policy 

recommendations for the vaccination of uniformed peacekeepers to ensure the urgent 

vaccination of peacekeeping contingents and to improve safety of peacekeepers,  

 Considering that the unprecedented extent of the COVID-19 pandemic is likely 

to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security,  

 1. Calls for the strengthening of national and multilateral approaches and 

international cooperation, such as the COVAX Facility created within the ACT-A, and 

other relevant initiatives as appropriate, in order to facilitate equitable and affordable 

access to COVID-19 vaccines in armed conflict situations, post-conflict situations 

and complex humanitarian emergencies, stresses the need to develop international 

partnerships particularly to scale-up manufacturing and distribution capabilities, in 

recognition of differing national contexts, and notes the need to maintain incentives 

for the development of new health products; and recognising the role of extensive 

immunisation against COVID-19 as a global public good for health;  

 2. Reiterates its demand for a general and immediate cessation of hostilities 

in all situations on its agenda and supports the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-

General and his Special Representatives and Special Envoys in that respect;  

 3. Demands that all parties to armed conflicts engage immediately in a 

durable, extensive, and sustained humanitarian pause to facilitate, inter alia, the 

equitable, safe and unhindered delivery and distribution of COVID-19 vaccinations 

in areas of armed conflict; 

 4. Calls for full, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access, without delay, for 

humanitarian personnel and medical personnel, their equipment, transport and 

supplies, in order to facilitate, inter alia, COVID-19 vaccinations, as appropriate, and 

calls for the protection, safety, and security of such humanitarian and medical 

personnel, and in this regard urges all parties to protect civilian infrastructure which 

is critical to the delivery of humanitarian aid for essential services concerning 

vaccinations and related medical care, in situations of armed conflicts and complex 

humanitarian emergencies; 

 5. Reaffirms that this general and immediate cessation of hostilities and this 

humanitarian pause do not apply to military operations against the Islamic State in 

Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as Da’esh), Al Qaeda and Al Nusra Front, and 

all other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al Qaeda or 

ISIL, and other terrorist groups, which have been designated by the Security Council;  

 6. Demands that all parties to armed conflicts fully comply with their 

obligations under international law, including international human rights law, as 

applicable, and international humanitarian law, in particular their obligations under 

the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the obligations, as applicable, under the 

Additional Protocols of 1977 and 2005, to ensure the respect and protection of all 

medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, 



S/2021/171 
 

 

21-02814 4/4 

 

their means of transport and equipment, as well as hospi tals and other medical 

facilities; 

 7. Requests the Secretary-General to report on the implementation of this 

resolution, in particular a full assessment of the impediments to vaccine accessibility 

and the COVID-19 response, including vaccination programmes, in countries in 

situations of armed conflict and complex humanitarian emergencies, frequently and 

as necessary, and make recommendations to the Council;  

 8. Expresses its intention to review those specific situations brought to its 

attention by the Secretary-General where hostilities and the activities of armed groups 

are impeding COVID-19 vaccination and to consider what further measures may be 

necessary to ensure such impediments are removed and hostilities paused to enable 

vaccination; 

 9. Calls for COVID-19 national vaccination plans to include those at a higher 

risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms and the most vulnerable, including 

frontline workers, older people, refugees, internally displaced people, stateless 

people, indigenous people, migrants, persons with disabilities, detained persons, as 

well as people living in areas under the control of any non-state armed group;  

 10. Calls for full funding of the Global Humanitarian Overview 2021 that 

takes into account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on humanitarian situations, 

the ACT-A and its mechanisms such as the COVAX Facility and the health system 

connector, and other relevant initiatives to accelerate the development and production 

of, and equitable access to, COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 

 11. Emphasises the urgent need for solidarity, equity, and efficacy and invites 

donation of vaccine doses from developed economies and all those in a position to do 

so to low- and middle-income countries and other countries in need, particularly 

through the COVAX Facility including on the basis of the WHO allocation framework 

in addition to country-specific frameworks, for fair access and equitable allocation of 

COVID-19 health products; 

 12. Calls on Member States and all relevant stakeholders to promote research 

and capacity-building initiatives, as well as to enhance cooperation on and access to 

science, innovation, technologies, technical assistance and knowledge sharing, 

including through improved coordination among existing mechanisms, especially 

with developing countries, in a collaborative, coordinated and transparent manner in 

response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and further calls for taking steps to avoid 

speculation and undue stockpiling that may hinder access to safe and effec tive 

vaccines, especially for situations of armed conflict;  

 13. Further requests that Special Representatives and Special Envoys of the 

Secretary-General, within their respective mandates, and in coordination with all 

relevant stakeholders, including civil society and the COVAX Facility and ACT-A and 

other relevant initiatives as appropriate, use their good offices and mediation with 

parties to armed conflicts to facilitate the COVID-19 response including vaccination 

in situations of armed conflict, and in their ordinary reporting to the Council identify 

barriers to accessibility and those disrupting or blocking efforts to establish 

vaccination pauses; 

 14. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
