A/C.3/56/L.41

Recognizing the universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated
character of all human rights, and, in this regard, reaffirming the right to
development as an integral part of all human rights,

Recalling that the World Conference on Human Rights, held at Vienna from 14
to 25 June 1993, called upon States to refrain from any unilateral coercive measure
not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that
creates obstacles to trade relations among States and impedes the full realization of
all human rights,7

Bearing in mind all the references to this question in the Copenhagen
Declaration on Social Development, adopted by the World Summit for Social
Development on 12 March 1995,8 the Beijing Declaration and the Platform for
Action, adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women on 15 September
1995,9 the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements and the Habitat Agenda,
adopted by the second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements
(Habitat II) on 14 June 1996,10 and their five-year reviews,

Expressing its concern about the negative impact of unilateral coercive
measures in the field of international relations, trade, investment and cooperation,

Deeply concerned that, despite the recommendations adopted on this question
by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary
to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations, unilateral
coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their
negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and social
development of developing countries, including their extraterritorial effects, thereby
creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples
and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States,

Bearing in mind all the extraterritorial effects of any unilateral legislative,
administrative and economic measures, policies and practices of coercive nature
against the development process and the enhancement of human rights in developing
countries, which create obstacles to the full realization of all human rights,

Noting the continuing efforts of the Open-ended Working Group on the Right
to Development of the Commission on Human Rights, and reaffirming in particular
its criteria according to which coercive measures are one of the obstacles to the
implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development,11

1. Urges all States to refrain from adopting or implementing any unilateral
measures not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United
Nations, in particular those of a coercive nature with all their extraterritorial effects,
which create obstacles to trade relations among States, thus impeding the full
realization of the rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights12

and other international human rights instruments, in particular the right of
individuals and peoples to development;

2. Invites all States to consider adopting administrative or legislative
measures, as appropriate, to counteract the extraterritorial application or effects of
unilateral coercive measures;

3. Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects
as tools for political or economic pressure against any country, in particular against
developing countries, because of their negative effects on the realization of all the
human rights of vast sectors of their populations, in particular children, women and
the elderly;

4. Calls upon Member States that have initiated such measures to commit
themselves to their obligations and responsibilities arising from the international
human rights instruments to which they are party by revoking such measures at the
earliest time possible;

5. Reaffirms, in this context, the right of all peoples to self-determination,
by virtue of which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their
economic, social and cultural development;

6. Urges the Commission on Human Rights to take fully into account the
negative impact of unilateral coercive measures, including the enactment of national
laws and their extraterritorial application, in its task concerning the implementation
of the right to development;

7. Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in
discharging her functions relating to the promotion, realization and protection of the
right to development and bearing in mind the continuing impact of unilateral
coercive measures on the population of developing countries, to give priority to the
present resolution in her annual report to the General Assembly;

8. Requests the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the
attention of all Member States, to continue to collect their views and information on
the implications and negative effects of unilateral coercive measures on their
populations and to submit an analytical report thereon to the General Assembly at its
fifty-seventh session, highlighting the practical and preventive measures in this
respect;

9. Decides to examine the question on a priority basis at its fifty-seventh
session under the sub-item entitled “Human rights questions, including alternative
approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental
freedoms”.
