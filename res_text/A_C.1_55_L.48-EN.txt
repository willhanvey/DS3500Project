Fifty-fifth session
First Committee
Agenda item 73 (r)
General and complete disarmament: follow-up to the advisory
opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legality of
the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons

Bangladesh, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Colombia, Congo, Costa Rica,
Ecuador, Fiji, Ghana, Guyana, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq,
Kenya, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria,
Peru, Philippines, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Sudan,
Thailand, Viet Nam, Zambia and Zimbabwe: draft resolution

Follow-up to the advisory opinion of the International Court of
Justice on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolutions 49/75 K of 15 December 1994, 51/45 M of 10
December 1996, 52/38 O of 9 December 1997, 53/77 W of 4 December 1998 and
54/54 Q of 1 December 1999,

Convinced that the continuing existence of nuclear weapons poses a threat to
all humanity and that their use would have catastrophic consequences for all life on
Earth, and recognizing that the only defence against a nuclear catastrophe is the total
elimination of nuclear weapons and the certainty that they will never be produced
again,

Reaffirming the commitment of  the international community to the goal of the
total elimination of nuclear weapons and the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free
world,

Mindful of the solemn obligations of States parties, undertaken in article VI of
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,1 particularly to pursue
negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear
arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament,

A/C.1/55/L.48

Recalling the principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and
disarmament adopted at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,2

Welcoming the unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon States to
accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear
disarmament,

Recalling also the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in
its resolution 50/245 of 10 September 1996, and expressing its satisfaction at the
increasing number of States that have signed and ratified the Treaty,

Recognizing with satisfaction that the Antarctic Treaty3 and the treaties of
Tlatelolco,4 Rarotonga,5 Bangkok6 and Pelindaba7 are gradually freeing the entire
southern hemisphere and adjacent areas covered by those treaties from nuclear
weapons,

Noting the efforts by the States possessing the largest inventories of nuclear
weapons to reduce their stockpiles of such weapons through bilateral agreements or
arrangements and unilateral decisions, and calling for the intensification of such
efforts to accelerate the significant reduction of nuclear-weapon arsenals,

Recognizing the need for a multilaterally negotiated and legally binding
instrument to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the threat or use of nuclear
weapons,

Reaffirming the central role of the Conference on Disarmament as the single
multilateral disarmament negotiating forum, and regretting the lack of progress in
disarmament negotiations, particularly nuclear disarmament, in the Conference on
Disarmament during its 2000 session,

Emphasizing the need for the Conference on Disarmament to commence
negotiations on a phased programme for the complete elimination of nuclear
weapons with a specified framework of time,

Desiring to achieve the objective of a legally binding prohibition of the
development, production, testing, deployment, stockpiling, threat or use of nuclear
weapons and their destruction under effective international control,

Recalling the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the
Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, issued on 8 July 1996,8

Taking note of the relevant portions of the note by the Secretary-General9
relating to the implementation of resolution 54/54 Q,

1. Underlines once again the unanimous conclusion of the International
Court of Justice that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a
conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict
and effective international control;

2. Calls once again upon all States immediately to fulfil that obligation by
commencing multilateral negotiations in 2001 leading to an early conclusion of a
nuclear weapons convention prohibiting the development, production, testing,
deployment, stockpiling, transfer, threat or use of nuclear weapons and providing for
their elimination;

3. Requests all States to inform the Secretary-General of the efforts and
measures they have taken on the implementation of the present resolution and
nuclear disarmament, and requests the Secretary-General to apprise the General
Assembly of that information at its fifty-sixth session;

4. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-sixth session the
