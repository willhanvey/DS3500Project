 Taking note of General Assembly Resolutions 71/72 and 70/80, by which 

Member States decided to continue to include on the agenda of the General 

Assembly issues related to assistance in mine action and countering the threat posed 

by improvised explosive devices,  

 Recalling also all relevant treaties and conventions related to mine action, 

their implementation and their review processes, by the respective parties,  

 Expressing deep concern at the serious and lasting threat to civilians posed by

 Expressing deep concern about the number of civilians, including children, 

killed or maimed by landmines, explosive remnants of war and improvised 

explosive devices, in conflict and post conflict situations,  

 Expressing deep concern to the serious humanitarian threat, posed to civilians 

by landmines, explosive remnants of war and improvised explosive devices in
