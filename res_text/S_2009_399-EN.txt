draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming its resolutions 1261 (1999) of 25 August 1999, 1314 (2000) of 
11 August 2000, 1379 (2001) of 20 November 2001, 1460 (2003) of 30 January 
2003, 1539 (2004) of 22 April 2004, and 1612 (2005) of 26 July 2005, and the 
Statements of its President on 24 July 2006 (S/PRST/2006/33), 28 November 2006 
(S/PRST/2006/48), 12 February 2008 (S/PRST/2008/6), 17 July 2008 
(S/PRST/2008/28) and 29 April 2009 (S/PRST/2009/9), which contribute to a 
comprehensive framework for addressing the protection of children affected by 
armed conflict,  

 Acknowledging that the implementation of its resolution 1612 (2005) has 
generated progress, resulting in the release and reintegration of children into their 
families and communities and in a more systematic dialogue between the United 
Nations country-level task forces and parties to the armed conflict on the 
implementation of time-bound action plans, while remaining deeply concerned over 
the lack of progress on the ground in some situations of concern, where parties to 
conflict continue to violate with impunity the relevant provisions of applicable 
international law relating to the rights and protection of children in armed conflict, 

 Stressing the primary role of national Governments in providing protection and 
relief to all children affected by armed conflicts, 

 Reiterating that all actions undertaken by United Nations entities within the 
framework of the monitoring and reporting mechanism must be designed to support 
and supplement, as appropriate, the protection and rehabilitation roles of national 
Governments, 



S/2009/399  
 

09-44208 2 
 

 Recalling the responsibilities of States to end impunity and to prosecute those 
responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other egregious 
crimes perpetrated against children,  

 Welcoming the fact that several individuals who are alleged to have committed 
crimes against children in situations of armed conflict have been brought to justice 
by national justice systems and international justice mechanisms and mixed criminal 
courts and tribunals, 

 Convinced that the protection of children in armed conflict should be an 
important aspect of any comprehensive strategy to resolve conflict, 

 Calling on all parties to armed conflicts to comply strictly with the obligations 
applicable to them under international law for the protection of children in armed 
conflict, including those contained in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and 
its Optional Protocol on the involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, as well as 
the Geneva Conventions of 12th August 1949 and their Additional Protocols of 
1977, 

 Reiterating its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international 
peace and security and, in this connection, its commitment to address the 
widespread impact of armed conflict on children, 

 Stressing its determination to ensure respect for its resolutions and other 
international obligations and applicable norms on the protection of children affected 
by armed conflict, 

 Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 26 March 2009 
(S/2009/158) and stressing that the present resolution does not seek to make any 
legal determination as to whether situations which are referred to in the Secretary-
General’s report are or are not armed conflicts within the context of the Geneva 
Conventions and the Additional Protocols thereto, nor does it prejudge the legal 
status of the non-State parties involved in these situations, 

 Deeply concerned that children continue to account for a considerable number 
of casualties resulting from killing and maiming in armed conflicts including as a 
result of deliberate targeting, indiscriminate and excessive use of force, 
indiscriminate use of landmines, cluster munitions and other weapons and use of 
children as human shields and equally deeply concerned about the high incidence 
and appalling levels of brutality of rape and other forms of sexual violence 
committed against children, in the context of and associated with armed conflict 
including the use or commissioning of rape and other forms of sexual violence in 
some situations as a tactic of war, 

 1. Strongly condemns all violations of applicable international law 
involving the recruitment and use of children by parties to armed conflict as well as 
their re-recruitment, killing and maiming, rape and other sexual violence, 
abductions, attacks against schools or hospitals and denial of humanitarian access by 
parties to armed conflict and all other violations of international law committed 
against children in situations of armed conflict; 

 2. Reaffirms that the monitoring and reporting mechanism will continue to 
be implemented in situations listed in the annexes to the reports of the Secretary-
General on children and armed conflict in line with the principles set out in 
paragraph 2 of its resolution 1612 (2005) and that its establishment and 



 S/2009/399
 

3 09-44208 
 

implementation shall not prejudge or imply a decision by the Security Council as to 
whether or not to include a situation on its agenda; 

 3. Recalls paragraph 16 of its resolution 1379 (2001) and requests the 
Secretary-General also to include in the annexes to his reports on children and 
armed conflict those parties to armed conflict that engage, in contravention of 
applicable international law, in patterns of killing and maiming of children and/or 
rape and other sexual violence against children, in situations of armed conflict, 
bearing in mind all other violations and abuses against children, and notes that the 
present paragraph will apply to situations in accordance with the conditions set out 
in paragraph 16 of its resolution 1379 (2001); 

 4. Invites the Secretary-General through his Special Representative for 
Children and Armed Conflict to exchange appropriate information and maintain 
interaction from the earliest opportunity with the governments concerned regarding 
violations and abuses committed against children by parties which may be included 
in the annexes to his periodic report;  

 5. While noting that some parties to armed conflict have responded to its 
call upon them to prepare and implement concrete time-bound action plans to halt 
recruitment and use of children in violation of applicable international law;  

 (a) Reiterates its call on parties to armed conflict listed in the annexes of the 
Secretary-General’s report on children and armed conflict that have not already 
done so to prepare and implement, without further delay, action plans to halt 
recruitment and use of children in violation of applicable international law;  

 (b) Calls upon those parties listed in the annexes of the Secretary-General’s 
report on children and armed conflict that commit, in contravention of applicable 
international law, killing and maiming of children and/or rape and other sexual 
violence against children, in situations of armed conflict, to prepare concrete time-
bound action plans to halt those violations and abuses;  

 (c) Further calls upon all parties listed in the annexes to the Secretary-
General’s report on children and armed conflict to address all other violations and 
abuses committed against children and undertake specific commitments and 
measures in this regard; 

 (d) Urges those parties listed in the annexes of the Secretary-General’s report 
on children and armed conflict to implement the provisions contained in this 
paragraph in close cooperation with the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General for Children and Armed Conflict and the United Nations country-level task 
forces on monitoring and reporting; 

 6. In this context, encourages Member States to devise ways, in close 
consultations with the United Nations country-level task force on monitoring and 
reporting and United Nations country teams, to facilitate the development and 
implementation of time-bound action plans, and the review and monitoring by the 
United Nations country-level task force of obligations and commitments relating to 
the protection of children in armed conflict; 

 7. Reiterates its determination to ensure respect for its resolutions on 
children and armed conflict, and in this regard: 



S/2009/399  
 

09-44208 4 
 

 (a) Welcomes the sustained activity and recommendations of its Working 
Group on Children and Armed Conflict as called for in paragraph 8 of its resolution 
1612 (2005), and invites it to continue reporting regularly to the Security Council;  

 (b) Requests enhanced communication between the Working Group and 
relevant Security Council Sanctions Committees, including through the exchange of 
pertinent information on violations and abuses committed against children in armed 
conflict;  

 (c) Reaffirms its intention to take action against persistent perpetrators in 
line with paragraph 9 of its resolution 1612 (2005);  

 8. Stresses the responsibility of the United Nations country-level task forces 
on monitoring and reporting and United Nations country teams, consistent with their 
respective mandates, to ensure effective follow-up to Security Council resolutions 
on children and armed conflict, to monitor and report progress to the Secretary-
General in close cooperation with his Special Representative for Children and 
Armed Conflict and ensure a coordinated response to issues related to children and 
armed conflict; 

 9. Requests the Secretary-General to include more systematically in his 
reports on children and armed conflict specific information regarding the 
implementation of the Working Group recommendations; 

 10. Reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to ensure that, in all his 
reports on country-specific situations, the matter of children and armed conflict is 
included as a specific aspect of the report, and expresses its intention to give its full 
attention to the information provided therein, including the implementation of 
relevant Security Council resolutions and of the recommendations of its Working 
Group on Children and Armed Conflict, when dealing with those situations on its 
agenda; 

 11. Welcomes the efforts of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in 
mainstreaming child protection into peacekeeping missions, in line with that 
Department’s recently adopted Child Protection Policy directive, and encourages the 
deployment of Child Protection Advisers to peacekeeping operations, as well as into 
relevant peacebuilding and political missions, and decides to continue the inclusion 
of specific provisions for the protection of children in such mandates;  

 12. Requests Member States, United Nations peacekeeping, peacebuilding 
and political missions and United Nations country teams, within their respective 
mandates and in close cooperation with governments of the concerned countries, to 
establish appropriate strategies and coordination mechanisms for information 
exchange and cooperation on child protection concerns, in particular cross-border 
issues, bearing in mind relevant conclusions by the Security Council Working Group 
on Children and Armed Conflict and paragraph 2 (d) of its resolution 1612 (2005);  

 13. Stresses that effective disarmament, demobilization and reintegration 
programmes for children, building on best practices identified by UNICEF and other 
relevant child protection actors, are crucial for the well-being of all children who, in 
contravention of applicable international law, have been recruited or used by armed 
forces and groups, and are a critical factor for durable peace and security, and urges 
national Governments and donors to ensure that these community-based 
programmes receive timely, sustained and adequate resources and funding; 



 S/2009/399
 

5 09-44208 
 

 14. Also stresses the importance of timely, sustained and adequate resources 
and funding for effective welfare programmes for all children affected by armed 
conflict;  

 15. Calls upon Member States, United Nations entities, including the 
Peacebuilding Commission and other parties concerned to ensure that the protection, 
rights, well-being and empowerment of children affected by armed conflict are 
integrated into all peace processes and that post-conflict recovery and reconstruction 
planning, programmes and strategies prioritize issues concerning children affected 
by armed conflict; 

 16. Calls upon concerned Member States to take decisive and immediate 
action against persistent perpetrators of violations and abuses committed against 
children in situations of armed conflict, and further calls upon them to bring to 
justice those responsible for such violations that are prohibited under applicable 
international law, including with regard to recruitment and use of children, killing 
and maiming and rape and other sexual violence, through national justice systems, 
and where applicable, international justice mechanisms and mixed criminal courts 
and tribunals, with a view to ending impunity for those committing crimes against 
children; 

 17. Requests the Secretary-General to continue to take the necessary 
measures including, where applicable, to bring the monitoring and reporting 
mechanism to its full capacity, to allow for prompt advocacy and effective response 
to all violations and abuses committed against children and to ensure that 
information collected and communicated by the mechanism is accurate, objective, 
reliable and verifiable; 

 18. Requests the Secretary-General to provide administrative and substantive 
support for the Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict 
taking into consideration its current workload and the need to strengthen its 
capacities and institutional memory;  

 19. Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report by May 2010 on the 
implementation of its resolutions and presidential statements on children and armed 
conflict, including the present resolution, which would include, inter alia: 

 (a) Annexed lists of parties in situations of armed conflict on the agenda of
