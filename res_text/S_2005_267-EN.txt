particular its resolutions 1543 (2004) of 14 May 2004 and 1573 (2004) of
16 November 2004,

Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 18 February 2005
(S/2005/99),

Commending the people and the Government of Timor-Leste for the peace and
stability they have achieved in the country, as well as for their continuing efforts
towards consolidating democracy and strengthening State institutions,

Further commending the United Nations Mission of Support in Timor-Leste
(UNMISET), under the leadership of the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General, and welcoming the continuing progress made towards the completion of
key tasks inscribed in its mandate, particularly during its consolidation phase, in
accordance with Security Council resolutions 1543 (2004) and 1573 (2004),

Paying tribute to Timor-Leste’s bilateral and multilateral partners for their
invaluable assistance, particularly with regard to institutional capacity-building and
social and economic development,

Expressing its appreciation to those Member States which have provided
support to UNMISET,

Having considered the letter dated 20 January 2005, from the Prime Minister
of Timor-Leste to the Secretary-General (S/2005/103),

Noting the Secretary-General’s analysis of the need for a United Nations
presence to remain in Timor-Leste after 20 May 2005, although at a reduced level,

Noting also that the emerging institutions in Timor-Leste are still in the
process of consolidation and that further assistance is required to ensure sustained
development and strengthening of key sectors, mainly rule of law, including justice,
human rights, and support for the Timor-Leste police, and other public
administration,

Acknowledging the excellent communication and good will that have
characterized relations between Timor-Leste and Indonesia including the decision to
establish a Truth and Friendship Commission, and their land border agreement
signed in Dili 8 April 2005, which covers approximately 96 percent of the land

institutions of Timor-Leste to deliver their services in accordance with international
principles of rule of law, justice, human rights, democratic governance,
transparency, accountability and professionalism;

4. Requests further that UNOTIL be led by a Special Representative of the

safety of personnel, and facilitated by appropriate levels of logistics support,
including transportation assets, such as air transport when necessary;

mechanisms, non-governmental organizations, private sector organizations and other

establish;

informed of developments on the ground and of the implementation of the mandate
of UNOTIL, and the planning for a transition to a sustainable development
assistance framework, and to submit a report within four months of the date of
adoption of the present resolution and every four months thereafter, with
