 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its relevant resolutions on the situation between Iraq and Kuwait, in 
particular resolutions 686 (1991), 687 (1991), 833 (1993), and 1284 (1999), and the 
reports of the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 14 of resolution 1284,  

 Recognizing that the situation that now exists in Iraq is significantly different 
from that which existed at the time of the adoption of resolution 661 (1990), and 
further recognizing the importance of Iraq achieving international standing equal to 
that which it held prior to the adoption of resolution 661 (1990),  

 Welcoming Iraq’s continued demonstration of its commitment to the full 
implementation of its outstanding obligations under the relevant Chapter VII 
resolutions, namely the continuation of payment of the outstanding amount of 
compensation administered by the United Nations Compensation Commission, and 
both Iraq and Kuwait’s efforts to advance regional stability, and welcoming also all 
the positive steps that have been taken by the Government of Iraq to fulfil  
resolution 833 (1993),  

 Welcoming further the ongoing cooperation between Iraq and Kuwait in the 
search for missing Kuwaiti and third-country nationals within the framework of the 
Tripartite Commission and its Technical Subcommittee under the auspices of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and the positive efforts by the 
Government of Iraq regarding the return of all Kuwaiti and third-country nationals 
or their remains, and the return of Kuwaiti property,  

 Reiterating the need for continued efforts to locate and repatriate missing 
Kuwaiti property, including the national archives, through the Iraqi interministerial 
committee established for this purpose,  

 Expressing its deep appreciation to the late Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov and 
Ambassador Gennady Tarasov, who in the capacity of High-level Coordinator, 
devoted their time and professional skills to carrying out the mandate outlined in 
paragraph 14 of resolution 1284 (1999) and ensuring that its implementation built 
trust between Iraq and Kuwait and contributed to the full normalization of their 
relations,
