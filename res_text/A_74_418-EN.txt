  Draft resolution II  

  Question of American Samoa  
 

 

 The General Assembly,  

 Having considered the question of American Samoa and examined the relevant 

chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the 

Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial 

Countries and Peoples for 2019,1  

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on American 

Samoa2 and other relevant information,  

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are 

valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people 

of American Samoa and in conformity with the clearly defined principles contained 

in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of 

15 December 1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,  

 Expressing concern that 59 years after the adoption of the Declaration on the 

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, 3 there still remain 17 

Non-Self-Governing Territories, including American Samoa,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2020 and the plans of action for the Second4 and Third International 

Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism,  

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of 

American Samoa require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the  options 

for self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical location, 

size of population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  

 Acknowledging the outcome of the referendum held on 6 November 2018, in 

which the proposal to give the Fono, the Territory’s legislature, the authority to 

override the Governor’s veto was rejected,  

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-

Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the 

Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world economy 

and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that 

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views

of the people of American Samoa in respect of their right to self-determination should 

be ascertained,  

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the 

local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional 

organizations,  

 Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding 

of the political status of the people of American Samoa and to fulfil its mandate 

effectively, it is important for it to be apprised by the United States of America as the 

administering Power and to receive information from other appropriate sources, 

including the representatives of the Territory, concerning the wishes and aspirations 

of the people of the Territory,  

 Aware of the importance both to American Samoa and to the Special Committee 

of the participation of elected and appointed representatives of American Samoa in 

the work of the Committee,  

 Recognizing the need for the Special Committee to ensure that the appropriate 

bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at 

assisting the people of American Samoa with their inalienable right to self -

determination and in gaining a better understanding of the options for self -

determination, on a case-by-case basis,  

 Mindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the 

Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 

representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 

the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the 

seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial element 

in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of 

the Territories,  

 Welcoming the Caribbean regional seminar on the theme “Implementation of the 

Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism: accelerating 

decolonization through renewed commitment and pragmatic measures”, held by the 

Special Committee in Grand Anse, Grenada, and hosted by the Government of 

Grenada from 2 to 4 May 2019, as a significant and forward-looking event, which 

enabled the participants to assess progress made and address challenges faced in the 

decolonization process, review the existing working methods of the Committee and 

renew its commitment to implementing its historic task,  

 Recognizing the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted 

by the seminar, which are annexed to the report of the Special Committee 5 and which 

outline the findings of the seminar, including, especially, the way forward for the 

decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General 

Assembly of the period 2011–2020 as the Third International Decade for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,6  

 Noting with appreciation the contribution to the development of some 

Territories by the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations 

system, in particular the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, 

the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the United Nations 

Development Programme and the World Food Programme, as well as regional 

institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean Community, the

Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, the Pacific Islands Forum and the agencies 

of the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific,  

 Noting the statement made by a representative of the Governor of American 

Samoa at the 2018 Pacific regional seminar,7  

 Noting also the statement made by a representative of the Governor of American 

Samoa at the 2018 Pacific regional seminar, in which he expressed his view that the 

people of American Samoa were happy with the relationship with the administering 

Power, which could be described as strong and healthy as well as benefic ial to the 

people and the Government of the Territory, and that the most important benefit to 

American Samoa had been the protection of its indigenous rights to the land as 

provided for in the Deeds of Cession,  

 Noting further the statement made by a representative of the Governor of 

American Samoa at the 2018 Pacific regional seminar that the political status of 

American Samoa as an unincorporated and unorganized territory of the administering 

Power limited its ability to self-government and exposed it to decisions made by the 

administering Power,  

 Noting the statement by the representative that, while certain aspects of the form 

of government of the Territory and its relationship with the administering Power were 

challenging and in need of improvement, the solutions could be found within the 

confines of the political and judicial systems of the administering Power and that the 

territorial Government was pursuing legal actions to counteract the impact of 

unfavourable federal actions and sought the internat ional community’s tacit support, 

 Noting also the information provided by the representative that the Government 

of American Samoa intended to pursue additional funding from the administering 

Power to maintain and expand the work of the Office of Political  Status,

 The General Assembly, 

 Having considered the question of Anguilla and examined the relevant chapter

Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial 

Countries and Peoples for 2019,1  

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on Anguilla 2 and 

other relevant information,  

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are 

valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people 

of Anguilla and in conformity with the clearly defined principles contained in General 

Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of 15 December 

1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,

Non-Self-Governing Territories, including Anguilla, 

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the

Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the 

Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world economy 

and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that 

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of Anguilla in respect of their right to self-determination should be

organizations, 

 Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding 

of the political status of the people of Anguilla and to fulfil its mandate effectively, it 

is important for it to be apprised by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 

Ireland as the administering Power and to receive information from other appropriate 

sources, including the representatives of the Territory, concerning the wishes and 

aspirations of the people of the Territory,

the Territories, 

 Welcoming the Caribbean regional seminar on the theme “Implementation of the

local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional 

organizations, 

 Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding

appropriate sources, including the representatives of the Territory, concerning the 

wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory,

case basis,

Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 

representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 

the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the

in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political statu s of 

the Territories,

decolonization process, review the existing working methods of the Committee and 

renew its commitment to implementing its historic task,  

 Recognizing the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted

Eradication of Colonialism,6

  Question of the British Virgin Islands  
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Having considered the question of the British Virgin Islands and examined the 

relevant chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard 

to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial 

Countries and Peoples for 2019,1  

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on the British 

Virgin Islands2 and other relevant information,  

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are 

valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people 

of the British Virgin Islands and in conformity with the clearly defined principles 

contained in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 

(XV) of 15 December 1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,  

 Expressing concern that 59 years after the adoption of the Declaration on the 

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples,3 there still remain 17 

Non-Self-Governing Territories, including the British Virgin Islands,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2020 and the plans of action for the Second 4 and Third International 

Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism,  

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of 

the British Virgin Islands require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the 

options for self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical 

location, size of population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the  people, 

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-

Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the 

Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world eco nomy 

and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that 

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV), 

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of the British Virgin Islands in respect of their right to self-determination 

should be ascertained,

Non-Self-Governing Territories, including the Cayman Islands,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2020 and the plans of action for the Second4 and Third International 

Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism,  

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of 

the Cayman Islands require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the 

options for self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical 

location, size of population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-

Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the 

Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world economy 

and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that 

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of the Cayman Islands in respect of their right to self-determination 

should be ascertained,

decolonization process, review the existing working methods of the Committee and 

renew its commitment to implementing its historic task,  

 Recognizing the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted

outline the findings of the seminar, including, especially, the way forward for the 

decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General

Eradication of Colonialism,6

new framework for relations between the Territory and the administering Power, 

providing for a greater measure of internal self-government for Guam and recognition 

of the right of the CHamoru people of Guam to self-determination for the Territory,  

 Aware that negotiations between the administering Power and the territorial

 Recalling also the statement made by the Speaker of the thirty-third Guam 

legislature before the Fourth Committee at the seventieth session of the General 

Assembly that the most acute threat to the legitimate exercise of the decolonization 

of Guam was the incessant militarization of the island by its administering Power,

Territory, 

 Noting the elections in the Territory that were held in November 2018,9

Countries and Peoples for 2019,1  

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on Pitcairn 2 and 

other relevant information, 

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are 

valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people 

of Pitcairn and in conformity with the clearly defined principles contained in General 

Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of 15 December 

1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of Pitcairn in respect of their right to self-determination should be

bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at 

assisting the people of Saint Helena with their inalienable right to self-determination 

and in gaining a better understanding of the options for self-determination, on a case-

by-case basis,  

 Mindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the 

Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 

representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 

the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the 

seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial element 

in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of 

the Territories,  

 Welcoming the Caribbean regional seminar on the theme “Implementation of the 

Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism: accelerating 

decolonization through renewed commitment and pragmatic measures”, held by the 

Special Committee in Grand Anse, Grenada, and hosted by the Government of 

Grenada from 2 to 4 May 2019, as a significant and forward-looking event, which 

enabled the participants to assess progress made and address challenges faced in the 

decolonization process, review the existing working methods of the Committee and 

renew its commitment to implementing its historic task,  

 Recognizing the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted 

by the seminar, which are annexed to the report of the Special Committee 5 and which 

outline the findings of the seminar, including, especially, the way forward for the 

decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General 

Assembly of the period 2011–2020 as the Third International Decade for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,6  

 Noting with appreciation the contribution to the development of some 

Territories by the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations 

system, in particular the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, 

the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the United Nations 

Development Programme and the World Food Programme, as well as regional 

institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean Community, the 

Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, the Pacific Islands Forum and the agencies 

of the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific,

concerns expressed by a representative of the Legislative Council of Saint Helena

  Draft resolution XIII 

  Question of Tokelau 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Having considered the question of Tokelau, 

 Taking note of the chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the 

Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of 

Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for 2019 relating to Tokelau,1  

 Recalling its resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, containing the 

Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, and 

all resolutions and decisions of the United Nations relating to Non-Self-Governing 

Territories, in particular General Assembly resolution 73/118 of 7 December 2018, 

 Noting with appreciation the continuing exemplary cooperation of New Zealand 

as the administering Power with regard to the work of the Special Committee relating 

to Tokelau and its readiness to permit access by United Nations visiting missions to 

the Territory,  

 Noting with appreciation also the collaborative contribution to the development 

of Tokelau by New Zealand and the specialized agencies and other organizations of 

the United Nations system, in particular the United Nations Development Programme 

and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,  

 Bearing in mind that, as a small island Territory, Tokelau exemplifies the 

situation of most remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories and that, as a case study 

pointing to successful cooperation for decolonization, Tokelau has wider significance 

for the United Nations as it seeks to complete its work in decolonization,  

 Recalling the status of Tokelau as an associate member of the Food and 

Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and of the Pacific Islands Forum,  

 Acknowledging the World No Tobacco Day Award for the western Pacific region 

granted to Tokelau in 2017 by the World Health Organization for its policy entitled 

“Tobacco-Free Tokelau by 2020”, and expressing hope that this could contribute to 

the well-being of the Territory and its peoples,  

 Cognizant that New Zealand and Tokelau signed, on 21 November 2003, a 

document entitled “Joint statement of the principles of partnership”, which sets out 

the rights and responsibilities of the two partners,  

 Bearing in mind the decision of the General Fono at its meeting in November 

2003, following extensive consultations undertaken in all three villages, to explore 

formally with New Zealand the option of self-government in free association, its 

decision in August 2005 to hold in February 2006 a referendum on self-determination 

on the basis of a draft constitution for Tokelau and a draft treaty of free association 

with New Zealand, and its subsequent decision to hold a further referendum in 

October 2007, and bearing in mind also that the two referendums did not produce the 

two-thirds majority of valid votes cast required by the General Fono to change the 

status of Tokelau from that of a Non-Self-Governing Territory under the 

administration of New Zealand,  

 Recalling the holding of free and fair elections in the Territory in January 2017, 

and noting the most recent change of the Ulu-o-Tokelau during its seventh General

and sensitive to their current situation, culminating in the approval and  ratification of 

the national symbol of the Territory, along with the constitution, national anthem and 

national flag,  

 Cognizant of the statement made by the Ulu-o-Tokelau at the Pacific regional

implementation plan for the first five years of the strategy, from 1 July 2017 to 

30 June 2022, and welcoming the launch of the Tokelau national greenhouse gas 

inventory report on 11 April 2019,

by the Government of Tokelau, it had submitted a formal declaration to the United 

Nations to extend the territorial application of both the United Nations Framework 

Convention on Climate Change3 and the Paris Agreement4 to Tokelau,  

 Recalling further the statements made by the representatives of the Government 

of New Zealand, as the administering Power, on 22 June 2018, at a session of the 

Special Committee, and at the Caribbean regional seminar held in Grand Anse, 

Grenada, in May 2019, which underlined the shared vision with Tokelau of building 

stronger governance and more effective management of public services, finances and 

infrastructure assets, with emphasis on quality health care and education, enhancing

service in April 2019, 

 1. Acknowledges the decision of the General Fono in 2008 that consideration 

of any future act of self-determination by Tokelau will be deferred and that New

  Draft resolution XIV  

  Question of the Turks and Caicos Islands 
 

 

 The General Assembly,  

 Having considered the question of the Turks and Caicos Islands and examined 

the relevant chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with 

regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to 

Colonial Countries and Peoples for 2019,1  

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on the Turks and 

Caicos Islands2 and other relevant information,  

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are 

valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people 

of the Turks and Caicos Islands and in conformity with the clearly defined principles 

contained in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 

(XV) of 15 December 1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,  

 Expressing concern that 59 years after the adoption of the Declaration on the 

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples,3 there still remain 17 

Non-Self-Governing Territories, including the Turks and Caicos Islands,  

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2020 and the plans of action for the Second4 and Third International 

Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism,  

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of 

the Turks and Caicos Islands require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to 

the options for self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, 

geographical location, size of population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people, 

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-

Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the 

Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world  economy 

and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that 

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of the Turks and Caicos Islands in respect of their right to self-

determination should be ascertained,

  Draft resolution XV 

  Question of the United States Virgin Islands  
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Having considered the question of the United States Virgin Islands and 

examined the relevant chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the Situation 

with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence 

to Colonial Countries and Peoples for 2019,1  

 Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on the United 

States Virgin Islands2 and other relevant information,  

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are 

valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people 

of the United States Virgin Islands and in conformity with the clearly defined 

principles contained in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 

1960, 1541 (XV) of 15 December 1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly, 

 Expressing concern that 59 years after the adoption of the Declaration on the 

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, 3  there still remain 

17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including the United States Virgin Islands, 

 Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the 

Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate 

colonialism by 2020 and the plans of action for the Second 4 and Third International 

Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism,  

 Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of 

the United States Virgin Islands require flexible, practical and innovative approaches 

to the options for self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, 

geographical location, size of population or natural resources,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should 

continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  

 Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-

Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the 

Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world economy 

and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that 

are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 

1514 (XV),  

 Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must 

take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, 

under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views 

of the people of the United States Virgin Islands in respect of their right to self-

determination should be ascertained,  

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the 

local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional organizations,
