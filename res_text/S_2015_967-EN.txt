sustainable peace,

South Sudan to take all appropriate measures in order to deter such activity, and 

further urging all parties to desist from these actions and instead contribute to 

promoting peace and reconciliation among the communities,

sanctions and noting with interest the 26 September 2015 communiqué of the 

African Union Peace and Security Council expressing its determination to impose 

measures against all those who impede implementation of the Agreement,  

 Emphasizing that persistent barriers to full implementation of resolution 1325 

(2000), and subsequent resolutions on women, peace, and security including 2242
