 Welcoming the Secretary-General’s report of 8 August 2007 (S/2007/479),

 Noting the progress made in rebuilding, equipping, and deploying the Liberian

Liberia, in cooperation with the international community, to expedite its efforts in 
these fields, 

 Expressing its appreciation for the continuing support of the international 
community, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the

 Recognizing the significant challenges that remain in the consolidation of

security forces and security architecture, 

 Reiterating the continuing need for UNMIL’s support for the security of the

benchmarks detailed in paragraph 66 of his report of 8 August 2007 (S/2007/479)
