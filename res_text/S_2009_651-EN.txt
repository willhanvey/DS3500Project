 The Security Council, 

 Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations 
Disengagement Observer Force of 18 November 2009 (S/2009/597), and also 
reaffirming its resolution 1308 (2000) of 17 July 2000, 

 1. Calls upon the parties concerned to implement immediately its resolution 
338 (1973) of 22 October 1973; 

 2. Welcomes the efforts being undertaken by the United Nations 
Disengagement Observer Force to implement the Secretary-General’s zero-tolerance 
policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and to ensure full compliance of its 
personnel with the United Nations code of conduct, requests the Secretary-General 
to continue to take all necessary action in this regard and to keep the Security 
Council informed, and urges troop-contributing countries to take preventive and 
disciplinary action to ensure that such acts are properly investigated and punished in 
cases involving their personnel; 

 3. Decides to renew the mandate of the United Nations Disengagement 
Observer Force for a period of six months, that is, until 30 June 2010; 

 4. Requests the Secretary-General to submit, at the end of this period, a 
report on developments in the situation and the measures taken to implement 
resolution 338 (1973).
