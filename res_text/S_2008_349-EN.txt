 Reaffirming its strongest condemnation of the 14 February 2005 terrorist

progress it continues to achieve under difficult circumstances in assisting the 
Lebanese authorities in their investigation into all aspects of this terrorist act, 

 Taking note of the request to extend the mandate of the Commission expressed 
by the Commissioner in his briefing to the Security Council on 8 April 2008, in 
order to ensure stability and continuity in the investigative process, 

 Taking note of the letter of the Prime Minister of Lebanon of 8 May 2008 
(S/2008/334, Enclosure) to the Secretary-General expressing the hope that the 
Security Council will respond favourably to the Commissioner’s request by 
extending the mandate of the Commission until 31 December 2008, and noting the 
concurrent recommendation of the Secretary-General in this regard, 

 Willing to continue to assist Lebanon in the search for the truth and in holding 
all those involved in this terrorist attack accountable,

 3. Requests the Commission to report to the Council on the progress of the 
investigation at the latest in six months, and at any other earlier time if it deems 
appropriate;
