  Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence  
to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized agencies and 
the international institutions associated with the United Nations 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Having considered the item entitled “Implementation of the Declaration on the 
Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized 
agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations”, 

 Having also considered the report of the Secretary-General1 and the report of 
the Economic and Social Council2 on the item, 

 Having examined the chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the 
Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of 
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for 2011 relating to the item,3 

 Recalling its resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 and 1541 (XV) of 
15 December 1960 and the resolutions of the Special Committee, as well as other 
relevant resolutions and decisions, including in particular Economic and Social 
Council resolution 2010/30 of 23 July 2010, 

 Bearing in mind the relevant provisions of the final documents of the 
successive Conferences of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries

of the African Union, the Pacific Islands Forum and the Caribbean Community, 

 Conscious of the need to facilitate the implementation of the Declaration on 
the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in 
resolution 1514 (XV), 

 Noting that the large majority of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories 
are small island Territories, 

 Welcoming the assistance extended to Non-Self-Governing Territories by 
certain specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, 
in particular the United Nations Development Programme, 

 Welcoming also the participation in the capacity of observers of those 
Non-Self-Governing Territories that are associate members of regional commissions 
in the world conferences in the economic and social spheres, subject to the rules of 
procedure of the General Assembly and in accordance with relevant resolutions and 
decisions of the United Nations, including resolutions and decisions of the 
Assembly and the Special Committee on specific Territories,

5 11-51009 
 

 Noting that only some specialized agencies and other organizations of the 
United Nations system have been involved in providing assistance to Non-Self-
Governing Territories, 

 Stressing that, because the development options of the small island Non-Self-
Governing Territories are limited, there are special challenges to planning for and 
implementing sustainable development and that those Territories will be constrained 
in meeting the challenges without the continuing cooperation and assistance of the 
specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, 

 Stressing also the importance of securing the resources necessary for funding 
expanded programmes of assistance for the peoples concerned and the need to enlist 
the support of all major funding institutions within the United Nations system in that 
regard, 

 Reaffirming the mandates of the specialized agencies and other organizations 
of the United Nations system to take all appropriate measures, within their 
respective spheres of competence, to ensure the full implementation of General 
Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant resolutions, 

 Expressing its appreciation to the African Union, the Pacific Islands Forum, 
the Caribbean Community and other regional organizations for the continued 
cooperation and assistance they have extended to the specialized agencies and other 
organizations of the United Nations system in this regard, 

 Expressing its conviction that closer contacts and consultations between and 
among the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations 
system and regional organizations help to facilitate the effective formulation of 
programmes of assistance to the peoples concerned, 

 Mindful of the imperative need to keep under continuous review the activities 
of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system in 
the implementation of the various resolutions and decisions of the United Nations 
relating to decolonization, 

 Bearing in mind the extremely fragile economies of the small island Non-Self-
Governing Territories and their vulnerability to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, 
cyclones and sea-level rise, and recalling the relevant resolutions of the General 
Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 65/110 of 10 December 2010 on the implementation of 
the Declaration by the specialized agencies and the international institutions 
associated with the United Nations, 

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;1 

 2. Recommends that all States intensify their efforts in the specialized 
agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system in which they are

Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), and other relevant resolutions of the United 
Nations; 

 3. Reaffirms that the specialized agencies and other organizations and 
institutions of the United Nations system should continue to be guided by the 
relevant resolutions of the United Nations in their efforts to contribute to the

11-51009 6 
 

implementation of the Declaration and all other relevant resolutions of the General 
Assembly; 

 4. Also reaffirms that the recognition by the General Assembly, the Security 
Council and other United Nations organs of the legitimacy of the aspirations of the 
peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories to exercise their right to 
self-determination entails, as a corollary, the extension of all appropriate assistance 
to those peoples; 

 5. Expresses its appreciation to those specialized agencies and other 
organizations of the United Nations system that have continued to cooperate with 
the United Nations and the regional and subregional organizations in the 
implementation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant 
resolutions of the United Nations, and requests all the specialized agencies and other 
organizations of the United Nations system to implement the relevant provisions of 
those resolutions; 

 6. Requests the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United 
Nations system to intensify their engagement with the work of the Special 
Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on 
the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples as an important 
element for the implementation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), 
including possible participation at the regional seminars on decolonization, upon the 
invitation of the Special Committee; 

 7. Requests the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United 
Nations system and international and regional organizations to examine and review 
conditions in each Territory so as to take appropriate measures to accelerate 
progress in the economic and social sectors of the Territories;

Territories to do so as soon as possible;

 A/66/432
 

7 11-51009

necessary mechanisms for its associate members, including Non-Self-Governing
