 The General Assembly,  

 Guided by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and affirming 
the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force,  

 Recalling its relevant resolutions, including resolution 61/118 of 14 December 
2006, as well as those resolutions adopted at its tenth emergency special session,  

 Recalling also relevant Security Council resolutions, including resolutions 242 
(1967) of 22 November 1967, 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979, 465 (1980) of 1 March

 Recalling the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International 
Court of Justice on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory,4 and recalling also General Assembly resolutions 
ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004 and ES-10/17 of 15 December 2006,  

 Noting that the International Court of Justice concluded that “the Israeli 
settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have 
been established in breach of international law”,5 

 Taking note of the recent report of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights 
Council on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by 
Israel since 1967,6 

 Recalling the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government 
Arrangements of 13 September 19937 and the subsequent implementation 
agreements between the Palestinian and Israeli sides,  

 Recalling also the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State solution to the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict,8 and noting specifically its call for a freeze on all 
settlement activity,  

 Aware that Israeli settlement activities involve, inter alia, the transfer of 
nationals of the occupying Power into the occupied territories, the confiscation of 
land, the exploitation of natural resources and other illegal actions against the 
Palestinian civilian population,  

 Bearing in mind the detrimental impact of Israeli settlement policies, decisions 
and activities on efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East, 

 Expressing grave concern about the continuation by Israel, the occupying 
Power, of settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory in violation of 
international humanitarian law, relevant United Nations resolutions and the 
agreements reached between the parties, and concerned particularly about Israel’s 
construction and expansion of settlements in and around Occupied East Jerusalem, 
including its so-called E-1 plan, aimed at connecting its illegal settlements around 
and further isolating Occupied East Jerusalem, and in the Jordan Valley,  

 Expressing grave concern also about the continuing unlawful construction by 
Israel of the wall inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around 
East Jerusalem, and expressing its concern in particular about the route of the wall 
in departure from the Armistice Line of 1949, which is causing serious humanitarian 
hardship and a serious decline of socio-economic conditions for the Palestinian 
people, is fragmenting the territorial contiguity of the Palestinian Territory and 
could prejudge future negotiations and make the two-State solution physically 
impossible to implement,  

 Deeply concerned that the wall’s route has been traced in such a way as to 
include the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem,

resolutions regarding the Israeli settlements, including Security Council resolution 
904 (1994), in which, among other things, the Council called upon Israel, the

confiscation of arms, with the aim of preventing illegal acts of violence by Israeli 
settlers, and called for measures to be taken to guarantee the safety and protection of 
the Palestinian civilians in the occupied territory;
