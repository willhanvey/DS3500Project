A/C.1/60/L.50/Rev.1

Continuing to take the view that an enhanced level of transparency in
armaments contributes greatly to confidence-building and security among States and
that the establishment of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms1
constitutes an important step forward in the promotion of transparency in military
matters,

Welcoming the consolidated report of the Secretary-General on the Register,2
which includes the returns of Member States for 2004,

Welcoming also the response of Member States to the request contained in
paragraphs 9 and 10 of resolution 46/36 L to provide data on their imports and
exports of arms, as well as available background information regarding their
military holdings, procurement through national production and relevant policies,

Welcoming further the inclusion by some Member States of their transfers of
small arms and light weapons in their annual report to the Register as part of their
additional background information,

Stressing that the continuing operation of the Register and its further
development should be reviewed in order to secure a Register that is capable of
attracting the widest possible participation,

1. Reaffirms its determination to ensure the effective operation of the
United Nations Register of Conventional Arms,1 as provided for in paragraphs 7 to
10 of resolution 46/36 L;

2. Calls upon Member States, with a view to achieving universal
participation, to provide the Secretary-General, by 31 May, annually with the
requested data and information for the Register, including nil reports if appropriate,
on the basis of resolutions 46/36 L and 47/52 L, the recommendations contained in
paragraph 64 of the 1997 report of the Secretary-General on the continuing
operation of the Register and its further development,3 the recommendations
contained in paragraph 94 of the 2000 report of the Secretary-General and the
appendices and annexes thereto4 and the recommendations contained in paragraphs
112 to 114 of the 2003 report of the Secretary-General;5

3. Invites Member States in a position to do so, pending further
development of the Register, to provide additional information on procurement from
national production and military holdings and to make use of the “Remarks” column
in the standardized reporting form to provide additional information such as types or
models and to include transfers of small arms and light weapons, using definitions
and reporting measures they deem appropriate, as part of their additional
background information;

4. Reaffirms its decision, with a view to further development of the
Register, to keep the scope of and participation in the Register under review and, to
that end:
