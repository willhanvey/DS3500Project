  Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence 

to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized agencies and

 The General Assembly, 

 Having considered the item entitled “Implementation of the Declaration on the 

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized 

agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations”,  

 Having also considered the report of the Secretary-General1 and the report of 

the Economic and Social Council2 on the item, 

 Having examined the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with 

regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to 

Colonial Countries and Peoples for 2021,3  

 Recalling its resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 and 1541 (XV) of 

15 December 1960 and the resolutions of the Special Committee, as well as other 

relevant resolutions and decisions, including, in particular, Economic and Social 

Council resolutions 2021/2 A of 14 September 2020 and 2021/2 B of 21 July 2021, 

 Bearing in mind the relevant provisions of the final documents of the successive 

Conferences of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries and of the 

resolutions adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African 

Union, the Pacific Islands Forum and the Caribbean Community,  

 Conscious of the need to facilitate the implementation of the Declaration on the

1514 (XV), 

 Noting that the large majority of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories 

are small island Territories, 

 Welcoming the assistance extended to Non-Self-Governing Territories by certain 

specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system,  

 Welcoming also the participation in the capacity of observers of those Non-Self-

Governing Territories that are associate members of regional commissions in the 

world conferences in the economic and social spheres, subject to the rules of 

procedure of the General Assembly and in accordance with relevant resolutions and 

decisions of the United Nations, including resolutions and decisions of the Assembly

 Stressing that, because the development options of the small island Non-Self-

Governing Territories are limited, there are special challenges to planning for and 

implementing sustainable development and that those Territories will be constrained 

in meeting those challenges without the continuing cooperation and assistance of the 

specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system,  

 Stressing also the importance of securing the resources necessary for funding 

expanded programmes of assistance for the peoples concerned and the need to enlist 

the support of all major funding institutions within the United Nations system in that 

regard, 

 Reaffirming the mandates of the specialized agencies and other organizations of 

the United Nations system to take all appropriate measures, within their respective

 Expressing its appreciation to the African Union, the Pacific Islands Forum, the 

Caribbean Community and other regional organizations for the continued cooperation 

and assistance that they have extended to the specialized agencies and other 

organizations of the United Nations system in this regard,  

 Expressing its conviction that closer contacts and consultations between and 

among the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system 

and regional organizations help to facilitate the effective formulation of programmes 

of assistance to the peoples concerned,  

 Mindful of the imperative need to keep under continuous review the activities 

of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system in 

the implementation of the various resolutions and decisions of the United Nations 

relating to decolonization, 

 Bearing in mind the extremely fragile economies of the small island Non-Self-

Governing Territories and their vulnerability to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, 

cyclones and sea level rise, and recalling the relevant resolutions of the General 

Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 75/104 of 10 December 2020 on the implementation of 

the Declaration by the specialized agencies and the international institutions

“International cooperation to ensure global access to medicines, vaccines and medical

health threats: combating COVID-19”, 75/156 of 16 December 2020, entitled
