of the Convention, and the integrated management and sustainable development of 
the oceans and seas,  

 Reiterating the essential need for cooperation, including through capacity-
building and transfer of marine technology, to ensure that all States, especially 
developing countries, in particular the least developed countries and small island 
developing States, as well as coastal African States, are able both to implement the 
Convention and to benefit from the sustainable development of the oceans and seas, as 
well as to participate fully in global and regional forums and processes dealing with 
oceans and law of the sea issues,  

 Emphasizing the need to strengthen the ability of competent international 
organizations to contribute, at the global, regional, subregional and bilateral levels, 
through cooperation programmes with Governments, to the development of national 
capacity in marine science and the sustainable management of the oceans and their 
resources,  

 Recalling that marine science is important for eradicating poverty, contributing 
to food security, conserving the world’s marine environment and resources, helping to

reclamation activities that are carried out in a manner that has a detrimental impact 
on the marine environment, 

 Reiterating its serious concern at the current and projected adverse effects of 
climate change and ocean acidification on the marine environment and marine 
biodiversity, and emphasizing the urgency of addressing these issues, 

 Expressing concern that climate change continues to increase the severity and 
incidence of coral bleaching throughout tropical seas and weakens the ability of 
reefs to withstand ocean acidification, which could have serious and irreversible 
negative effects on marine organisms, particularly corals, as well as to withstand 
other pressures, including overfishing and pollution, 

 Reiterating its deep concern at the vulnerability of the environment and the 
fragile ecosystems of the polar regions, including the Arctic Ocean and the Arctic 
ice cap, particularly affected by the projected adverse effects of climate change and 
ocean acidification,

committed at sea, including illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic 
substances, the smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons, illicit trafficking in 
firearms and threats to maritime safety and security, including piracy, armed robbery 
at sea, smuggling and terrorist acts against shipping, offshore installations and other 
maritime interests, and noting the deplorable loss of life and adverse impact on 
international trade, energy security and the global economy resulting from such 
activities, 

 Recognizing that fibre-optic submarine cables transmit most of the world’s data 
and communications and, hence, are vitally important to the global economy and the 
national security of all States, conscious that these cables are susceptible to intentional 
and accidental damage from shipping and other activities, and that the maintenance, 
including the repair, of these cables is important, noting that these matters have been 
brought to the attention of States at various workshops and seminars, and conscious of 
the need for States to adopt national laws and regulations to protect submarine cables 
and render their wilful damage or damage by culpable negligence punishable offences, 

 Noting the importance of the delineation of the outer limits of the continental 
shelf beyond 200 nautical miles and that it is in the broader interest of the 
international community that coastal States with a continental shelf beyond 200 
nautical miles submit information on the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond
