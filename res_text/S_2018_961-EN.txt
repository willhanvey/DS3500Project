 The Security Council, 

 Expressing grave concern about the most recent outbreak of the Ebola virus in

in the context of much wider humanitarian needs, in a country whose people have 

suffered from the recurrence of the disease, armed conflict and violence for the last 

few decades, 

 Recognizing the recurring threat of the Ebola virus in the region since it was 

first discovered in 1976 and recalling its Resolution 2177 (2014) concerning the 2014 

Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa,  

 Recalling its determination in resolution 2409 (2018) that the situation in the 

DRC continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security in the region, 

and expressing concern that this security situation negatively impacts the ability to 

respond to and contain the outbreak of the Ebola virus,  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 

territorial integrity of the DRC and all States in the region, and emphasizing the need 

for cooperation and coordination with the DRC to address the Ebola situation, as well 

as with the States in the region, as appropriate,  

 Noting the reports presented to the Security Council on 28 August and on 

3 October 2018 by the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO),  

 Commending the Government of the DRC for its leadership in responding to the 

Ebola outbreak, particularly for providing free health care in affected health zones, 

as well as for its daily reporting on the status of the outbreak,  

 Expressing appreciation for the efforts of all humanitarian and health workers 

on the ground, including the WHO and its partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and

 Recalling the International Health Regulations (2005), which are contributing 

to global public health security by improving the capacity of all countries to detect,

the need for awareness creation among district leaders in their roles in implementing 

the IHRs (2005), and drawing attention to large-scale population displacements in the 

region that could contribute to further spread of the Ebola virus,  

 Underscoring that the control of outbreaks of major infectious diseases requires

effective response and enabling them and national governments to purchase supplies 

and enhance emergency operations in the DRC and neighbouring countries, as well

of therapeutics, vaccines and diagnostics to treat patients and limit or prevent further
