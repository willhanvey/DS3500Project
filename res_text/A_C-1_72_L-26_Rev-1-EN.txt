perpetrators, organizers, sponsors or otherwise involved in the use of chemicals as 

weapons, including chlorine or any other toxic chemical, in the Syrian Arab 

Republic, where the fact-finding mission of the Organisation for the Prohibition of  

Chemical Weapons determined that a specific incident in the Syrian Arab Republic 

involved or likely involved the use of chemicals as weapons,  

 Reaffirming the importance of the outcome of the Third Special Session of the 

Conference of the States Parties to Review the Operation of the Chemical Weapons 

Convention, held in The Hague from 8 to 19 April 2013 (the Third Review 

Conference), including its consensus final report, in which the Conference 

addressed all aspects of the Convention and made important recommendations on its 

continued implementation, 

 Emphasizing that the Third Review Conference welcomed the fact that the 

Convention is a unique multilateral agreement banning an entire category of 

weapons of mass destruction in a non-discriminatory and verifiable manner under 

strict and effective international control and noted with satisfaction that the 

Convention continues to be a remarkable success and an example of effective 

multilateralism, 

 Convinced that the Convention, 20 years after its entry into force, has 

reinforced its role as the international norm against chemical weapons, and that it 

constitutes a major contribution to:  

 (a) International peace and security,  

 (b) Eliminating chemical weapons and preventing their re-emergence,  

 (c) The ultimate objective of general and complete disarmament under strict 

and effective international control,  

 (d) Excluding completely, for the sake of all mankind, the possibility of the 

use of chemical weapons,  

 (e) Promoting international cooperation and exchange in scientific and 

technical information in the field of chemical activities among States parties for 

peaceful purposes in order to enhance the economic and technological development 

of all States parties,  

 1. Reaffirms its condemnation in the strongest possible terms  of the use of 

chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances, emphasizing that any use of 

chemical weapons anywhere, at any time, by anyone, under any circumstances is 

unacceptable and is and would be a violation of international law and expressing its 

strong conviction that those individuals responsible for the use of chemical weapons 

must and should be held accountable; 

 2. Condemns in the strongest possible terms  the use of chemical weapons as 

reported by the Joint Investigative Mechanism of the Organisation for the 

Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the United Nations in:  

 (a) Its reports of 24 August 2016
2
 and 21 October 2016,

3
 which concluded 

that there was sufficient information to determine that the Syrian Arab 

Armed Forces were responsible for the attacks which released toxic 

substances in Talmenes, Syrian Arab Republic, on 21 April 2014, in 

Sarmin, Syrian Arab Republic, on 16 March 2015, and in Qmenas, Syrian 

Arab Republic, also on 16 March 2015, and that the so-called “Islamic

State in Iraq and the Levant” used sulfur mustard in Marea, Syrian Arab 

Republic, on 21 August 2015; and  

 (b) Its report of 26 October 2017,
4
 which concluded that there was sufficient 

information to be confident that Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant was 

responsible for the use of sulfur mustard at Umm Hawsh on 15 and 

16 September 2016 and that the Syrian Arab Republic was responsible 

for the release of sarin at Khan Shaykhun on 4 April 2017;  

and demands that the perpetrators immediately desist from any further use of 

chemical weapons; 

 3. Reiterates the grave concern expressed by the Executive Council of the 

Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in its decision EC-84/DEC.8 

of 9 March 2017 that, according to statements by the Government of Malaysia, a 

chemical weapon — the Schedule 1 nerve agent VX — was used in a fatal incident 

on 13 February 2017 at Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2; 

 4. Emphasizes that the universality of the Convention on the Prohibition of 

the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on 

Their Destruction
1
 is essential to achieving its object and purpose and to enhancing 

the security of States parties, as well as to international peace and security, 

underlines the fact that the objectives of the Convention will not be fully realized as 

long as there remains even a single State not party to the Convention that could 

possess or acquire such weapons, and calls upon all States that have not yet done so 

to become parties to the Convention without delay;  

 5. Underlines the fact that the full, effective and non-discriminatory 

implementation of all articles of the Convention makes a major contribution to 

international peace and security through the elimination of existing stockpiles of 

chemical weapons and the prohibition of their acquisition and use, and provides for 

assistance and protection in the event of use or threat of use of chemical weapons 

and for international cooperation for peaceful purposes in the field of chemical 

activities; 

 6. Notes the impact of scientific and technological progress on the effective 

implementation of the Convention and the importance for the Organisation for the 

Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and its policymaking organs of taking due 

account of such developments; 

 7. Reaffirms that the obligation of the States parties to complete the 

destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles and the destruction or conversion of 

chemical weapons production facilities in accordance with the provisions of the 

Convention and the Annex on Implementation and Verification (Verification Annex) 

and under the verification of the Technical Secretariat of the Organisation for  the 

Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is essential for the realization of the object and 

purpose of the Convention;  

 8. Stresses the importance to the Convention that all possessors of chemical 

weapons, chemical weapons production facilities or chemical weapons development 

facilities, including previously declared possessor States, should be among the 

States parties to the Convention, and welcomes progress to that end;  

 9. Recalls that the Third Special Session of the Conference of the States 

Parties to Review the Operation of the Chemical Weapons Convention expressed 

concern regarding the statement made by the Director General of the Organisation 

for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in his report to the Executive Council of

the Organisation at its sixty-eighth session, provided in accordance with paragraph 2 

of decision C-16/DEC.11 of 1 December 2011 adopted by the Conference of the 

States Parties at its sixteenth session, that three possessor States parties, namely, 

Libya, the Russian Federation and the United States of America, had been unable to 

fully meet the final extended deadline of 29 April 2012 for the destruction of their 

chemical weapons stockpiles, and also expressed determination that the destruction 

of all categories of chemical weapons should be completed in the shortest time 

possible in accordance with the provisions of the Convention and the Verification 

Annex, and with the full application of the relevant decisions that have been taken;  

 10. Welcomes the confirmation by the Director General of the Organisation 

for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons expressed in his report of 5 October 2017,
5
 

based upon information received from the Russian Federation and independent 

information received from the inspectors of the Organisation, regarding th e 

completion of the full destruction of chemical weapons declared by the Russian 

Federation; 

 11. Also welcomes the ongoing progress related to the destruction of Libya’s 

remaining category 2 chemical weapons outside the territory of Libya in line with 

the relevant Executive Council decisions;  

 12. Notes with concern that, along with the threat of the possible production, 

acquisition and use of chemical weapons by States, the international community 

also faces the danger of the production, acquisition and use of chemical weapons by 

non-State actors, including terrorists, concerns which have highlighted the necessity 

of achieving universal adherence to the Convention, as well as the high level of 

readiness of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and stresses 

that the full and effective implementation of all provisions of the Convention, 

including those on national implementation (article VII) and assistance and 

protection (article X), constitutes an important contribution to the efforts of  the 

United Nations in the global fight against terrorism in all its forms and 

manifestations; 

 13. Notes that the effective application of the verification system builds 

confidence in compliance with the Convention by States parties;  

 14. Stresses the importance of the Organisation for the Prohibition of 

Chemical Weapons in verifying compliance with the provisions of the Convention 

as well as in promoting the timely and efficient accomplishment of all its objectives;  

 15. Expresses grave concern that the Technical Secretariat, as reported by 

the Director General in his report of 4 October 2017,
6
 is not able to resolve all 

identified gaps, inconsistencies and discrepancies in the declaration of the Syrian 

Arab Republic and, therefore, cannot fully verify that the Syrian Arab Republic has 

submitted a declaration that can be considered accurate and complete in accordance 

with the Convention or Executive Council decision EC -M-33/DEC.1, and 

underscores the importance of such full verification;  

 16. Urges all States parties to the Convention to meet in full and on time 

their obligations under the Convention and to support the Organisation for the 

Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in its implementation activities;  

 17. Welcomes the progress made in the national implementation of article VII 

obligations, commends the States parties and the Technical Secretariat for assisting 

other States parties, on request, with the implementation of the follow -up to the plan 

of action regarding article VII obligations, and urges States parties that have not

expertise, including taking advantage of established training centres;  

 19. Reaffirms that the provisions of the Convention shall be implemented in 

a manner that avoids hampering the economic or technological development of 

States parties and international cooperation in the field of chemical activities for 

purposes not prohibited under the Convention, including the international exchange 

of scientific and technical information, and chemicals and equipment for the 

production, processing or use of chemicals for purposes not prohibited under the 

Convention; 

 20. Emphasizes the importance of the provisions of article XI of the 

Convention relating to the economic and technological development of States 

parties, recalls that the full, effective and non -discriminatory implementation of 

those provisions contributes to universality, and reaffirms the undertaking of the 

States parties to foster international cooperation for peaceful purposes in the field of 

chemical activities of the States parties and the importance of that cooperation and
