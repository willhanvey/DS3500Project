 Recalling its resolutions and the statements of its President concerning the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, 

 Reaffirming its commitment to respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity and 
political independence of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 

 Recalling the support it provided, in particular through the United Nations 
Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), for the 
process of the Global and All-Inclusive Agreement on the Transition, signed in 
Pretoria on 17 December 2002, and for the elections that represented the 
culmination of that process, and reaffirming its commitment to continue to 
contribute to the consolidation of peace and stability in the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo in the post-transition period, 

 Stressing the primary responsibility of the Government of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo for ensuring security in its territory and protecting its 
civilians with respect for the rule of law, human rights and international 
humanitarian law, 

 Deploring again the violence and loss of lives which occurred in late January 
and early February 2007 in the province of Bas-Congo and from 22 to 25 March 
2007 in Kinshasa, encouraging the Congolese authorities and MONUC to continue 
and complete the necessary investigations into these events, regretting the use of 
violence, instead of dialogue, to resolve disputes, and urging all Congolese 
stakeholders to pursue negotiated solutions to their differences with respect for the 
constitutional framework and the law, 

 Paying tribute to the international community for the assistance provided to 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, encouraging the maintenance of that 
assistance, and underlining its commitment to the continuation of a regular political 
dialogue with the Congolese authorities,  

 Recalling the importance of elections, including the forthcoming local 
elections, as a milestone for the longer term restoration of peace and stability, 
national reconciliation and establishment of the rule of law in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, 

 Recalling also the importance of urgently carrying out security sector reform 
and of disarming, demobilizing, resettling or repatriating, as appropriate, and

the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the contribution made by international 
partners in this field, 

 Reiterating its grave concern at the presence of armed groups and militias in 
the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly in the Ituri 
district and in North and South Kivu, which perpetuate a climate of insecurity in the 
whole region, 

 Deploring again the persistence of violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in particular those 
carried out by these militias and armed groups and by elements of the Armed Forces 
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC), the Congolese National Police 
(PNC) and other security and intelligence services, and stressing the urgent need for 
those responsible for these crimes to be brought to justice,  

 Recalling its resolution 1612 (2005) on children in armed conflict and the 
subsequent conclusions of the Security Council Working Group on Children and 
Armed Conflict pertaining to parties in the armed conflict of the Democratic 
Republic of Congo (S/2006/724), 

 Calling attention to the grave humanitarian situation that persists in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and calling on Member States to continue to

resolution 1649 (2005) and in paragraph 13 of resolution 1698 (2006),

illicit trade in such resources and the proliferation and trafficking of arms as one of 
the factors fuelling and exacerbating conflicts in the Great Lakes region of Africa, 
and in particular in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and urging all States, 
especially those in the region, to take appropriate steps to end these illegal 
activities,
