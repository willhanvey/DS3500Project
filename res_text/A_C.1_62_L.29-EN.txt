General and complete disarmament 

 
 
 

  Chile, New Zealand, Nigeria, Sweden and Switzerland: draft resolution 
 
 

  Decreasing the operational readiness of nuclear weapons systems 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling that the maintenance of nuclear weapons on high alert was a feature 
of Cold War nuclear postures, and welcoming the increased confidence and 
transparency since the cessation of the Cold War, 

 Concerned that, notwithstanding the end of the Cold War, several thousand 
nuclear weapons remain on high alert, ready to be launched within minutes, 

 Noting the increased engagement in multilateral disarmament forums in 
support of further reductions to the operational status of nuclear weapons systems, 

 Recognizing that the maintenance of nuclear weapons systems at a high level 
of readiness increases the risk of the use of such weapons, including the 
unintentional or accidental use, which would have catastrophic consequences, 

 Also recognizing that reductions in deployments and the lowering of 
operational status contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security, 
as well as to the process of nuclear disarmament, through the enhancement of 
confidence-building and transparency measures and a diminishing role for nuclear 
weapons in security policies, 

 Welcoming bilateral initiatives, such as the proposed United States/Russian 
Federation Joint Centre for the Exchange of Data from Early Warning Systems and 
Notification of Missile Launches, which can play a central role in operational status 
reduction processes, 

 Also welcoming the steps taken by some States to reduce the operational status 
of their nuclear weapons systems, including de-targeting initiatives and increasing 
the amount of preparation time required for deployment, 



A/C.1/62/L.29  
 

07-54960 2 
 

 1. Calls for the taking of further practical steps to decrease the operational 
readiness of nuclear weapons systems, with a view to ensuring that all nuclear 
weapons are removed from high alert status; 

 2. Urges States to update the General Assembly on progress made in the 
implementation of the present resolution; 

 3. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
