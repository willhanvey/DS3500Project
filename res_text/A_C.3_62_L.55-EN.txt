pluralism, development, better standards of living and solidarity, 

 Recognizing that the international community should devise ways and means 
to remove current obstacles and meet the challenges to the full realization of all

role; 

 5. Calls upon Member States to refrain from enacting or enforcing

 6. Calls upon all States to cooperate fully, through constructive dialogue, to 
ensure the promotion and protection of all human rights for all and in promoting
