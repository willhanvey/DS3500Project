 The General Assembly,

 Recalling also its resolution 36/120 E of 10 December 1981 and all its 
subsequent relevant resolutions, including resolution 56/31 of 3 December 2001, in 
which it, inter alia, determined that all legislative and administrative measures and 
actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purported to

so-called “Basic Law” on Jerusalem and the proclamation of Jerusalem as the 
capital of Israel, were null and void and must be rescinded forthwith,

decided not to recognize the “Basic Law” on Jerusalem, 

 Recalling the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International

and the further isolation of the city from the rest of the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, which are having a detrimental effect on the lives of Palestinians and 
could prejudge a final status agreement on Jerusalem, 

 Expressing its grave concern further about the continuing Israeli demolition of 
Palestinian homes, the revocation of residency rights and the eviction and 
displacement of numerous Palestinian families from East Jerusalem neighbourhoods, 
as well as other acts of provocation and incitement, including by Israeli settlers, in 
the city, including desecration of mosques and churches, 

 Expressing its concern about the Israeli excavations undertaken in the Old City 
of Jerusalem, including in and around religious sites,  

 Reaffirming that the international community, through the United Nations, has 
a legitimate interest in the question of the City of Jerusalem and in the protection of 
the unique spiritual, religious and cultural dimensions of the city, as foreseen in 
relevant United Nations resolutions on this matter, 

 Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in the 
Middle East,2 

 1. Reiterates its determination that any actions taken by Israel, the occupying 
Power, to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the Holy City of 
Jerusalem are illegal and therefore null and void and have no validity whatsoever, 
and calls upon Israel to immediately cease all such illegal and unilateral measures; 

 2. Stresses that a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the question of 
the City of Jerusalem should take into account the legitimate concerns of both the 
Palestinian and Israeli sides and should include internationally guaranteed 
provisions to ensure the freedom of religion and of conscience of its inhabitants, as 
well as permanent, free and unhindered access to the holy places by people of all 
religions and nationalities; 

 3. Also stresses the need for the parties to observe calm and restraint and to 
refrain from provocative actions, incitement and inflammatory rhetoric, especially 
in areas of religious and cultural sensitivity, and expresses its grave concern in 
particular about the recent series of negative incidents in East Jerusalem; 

 4. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its 
sixty-ninth session on the implementation of the present resolution.
