 Noting that sovereign debt crises are a recurring problem that involves very 

serious political, economic and social consequences, and that the restructuring 

processes of sovereign debt are a frequent phenomenon in the international financial 

system, 

 Noting with concern that there remain a number of low- and middle-income 

developing countries that are still facing difficulties in finding a durable solution to 

their external debt problems, which could adversely affect their sustainable 

development,  

 Recognizing that addressing the sovereign debt problems of developing 

countries is an important part of international cooperation,  

 Stressing the importance for developing countries, on a case-by-case basis, of 

debt relief, including debt cancellation, as appropriate, and debt restructuring as

A/68/L.57/Rev.1 

 

3/4 14-60105 

 

 Stressing also the need to work towards the establishment of responsible and 

preventive financial crisis policies to enhance transparent and sustainable national 

financial systems, 

 Recognizing the sovereign right of any State to restructure its sovereign debt, 

which should not be frustrated or impeded by any measure emanating from another 

State, 

 Recognizing also that a State’s efforts to restructure its sovereign debt should 

not be frustrated or impeded by commercial creditors, including specialized investor 

funds such as hedge funds, which seek to undertake speculative purchases of its 

distressed debt at deeply discounted rates on secondary markets in order to pursue 

full payment via litigation, 

 Noting that private creditors of sovereign debt are increasingly numerous, 

anonymous and difficult to coordinate and that there are a variety of debt 

instruments and a wide range of jurisdictions in which debt is issued, thus 

complicating the restructuring of sovereign debt,  

 Noting also the concern expressed in the declaration of the Summit of Heads 

of State and Government of the Group of 77 and China on the theme “For a New 

World Order for Living Well”, held in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Plurinational State of 

Bolivia, on 14 and 15 June 2014, concerning the so-called “vulture funds” and their 

actions of a highly speculative nature, which pose a risk to all future debt 

restructuring processes, for both developing and developed countries,  

 Taking into account the initiatives studied in the framework of the 

International Development Association of the World Bank and the International 

Monetary Fund to address the activities of the so-called “vulture funds”, with the 

objective of, inter alia, preventing such funds from benefiting fro m litigation 

initiated against indebted countries, which are forced to divert many of their 

resources to handle such litigation, thereby undermining the purpose of the debt 

restructuring processes, 

 Recalling, among other things, the work carried out by the International 

Monetary Fund in 2003, with the support of the International Monetary and 

Financial Committee, to formulate a proposal for a sovereign debt restructuring 

mechanism, 

 Stressing the importance of the Principles on Promoting Responsible 

Sovereign Lending and Borrowing issued by the United Nations Conference on 

Trade and Development on 4 May 2011, which aim to reduce the prevalence of 

sovereign debt crises, prevent unsustainable debt situations, maintain steady 

economic growth and help achieve the Millennium Development Goals, 

encouraging to that end responsible sovereign borrowing,  

 Stressing also the need to continue to address systemic fragilities and 

imbalances and the need for continuing efforts to reform and strengthen the 

international financial system, 

 Noting with concern that the international financial system does not have a 

sound legal framework for the orderly and predictable restructuring of sovereign 

debt, which further increases the cost of non-compliance, 



A/68/L.57/Rev.1 
 

 

14-60105 4/4 

 

 Recognizing the need to create a legal framework that facilitates the orderly 

restructuring of sovereign debts, allows the re-establishment of viability and growth 

without creating incentives that inadvertently increase the risk of non-compliance 

and acts as a deterrent to disruptive litigation that creditors could engage in during 

negotiations to restructure sovereign debts,  

 Stressing, in this context, the importance of establishing a clear set of 

principles for the management and resolution of financial crises that take into 

account the obligation of sovereign creditors to act in good faith and with a 

cooperative spirit to reach a consensual rearrangement of the debt of sovereign 

States, 

 Recognizing that debt-restructuring processes should have as their core 

element a determination of real payment capacity so that they do not adversely 

affect economic growth and the fulfilment of the unfinished business of the 

Millennium Development Goals, the sustainable development goals and the 

post-2015 development agenda, 

 Stressing that, in the restructuring of sovereign debt, the progressive 

development and codification of international law are necessary in order to make it 

a more effective means to implement the purposes and principles of the Charter of 

the United Nations and to give greater importance to its role in the relations among 

States, 

 1. Emphasizes the special importance of a timely, effective, comprehensive 

and durable solution to the debt problems of developing countries in order to 

promote their inclusive economic growth and development; 

 2. Calls for the intensification of efforts to prevent debt crises by enhancing 

international financial mechanisms for crisis prevention and resolution, in 

cooperation with the private sector, with a view to finding solutions acceptable to 

all;  

 3. Calls upon all Member States and the United Nations system, and invites 

the Bretton Woods institutions and the private sector, to take appropriate measures 

and actions for the implementation of the commitments, agreements and decisions 

of the major United Nations conferences and summits, in particular those related to 

the question of the external debt sustainability of developing countries;  

 4. Recognizes the roles of the United Nations and the international financial 

institutions in accordance with their respective mandates, and encourages them to 

continue to support global efforts towards sustainable development and a durable 

solution to the problem of the debt of developing countries;  

 5. Decides to elaborate and adopt through a process of intergovernmental 

negotiations, as a matter of priority during its sixty-ninth session, a multilateral 

legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes with a view, inter alia, to 

increasing the efficiency, stability and predictability of the international financial 

system and achieving sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth and 

sustainable development, in accordance with national circumstances and priorities;  

 6. Also decides to define the modalities for the intergovernmental 

negotiations and the adoption of the text of the multilateral legal framework at the 

main part of its sixty-ninth session, before the end of 2014.
