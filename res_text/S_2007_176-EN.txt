 Welcoming the Secretary-General’s report of 15 March 2007 (S/2007/151), 

 Further welcoming the continuing steps being taken by the Government of

progress made in regaining government control over Liberia’s natural resources, 

 Expressing its appreciation for the continuing financial and other support 
provided by the international community, the Economic Community of West African 
States (ECOWAS) and the African Union (AU) for the Liberian peace consolidation 
process, 

 Acknowledging and commending the work of the United Nations Mission in 
Liberia (UNMIL), under the leadership of the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General, for the important role it continues to play in supporting peace 
and stability in Liberia, and welcoming the close cooperation between UNMIL and 
the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire (UNOCI), as well as with 
neighbouring Governments, in coordinating security activities in the border areas in 
the subregion, 

 Noting with appreciation the substantial progress made in the reintegration of

 Recognizing that significant challenges remain in the consolidation of 
Liberia’s post-conflict transition, including massive development and reconstruction

mandate and to continue to inform the Council on progress on the stabilization of 
Liberia, with reference to the broad benchmarks laid out in his report of 
12 September 2006; 

 4. Calls on the Government of Liberia, in close coordination with UNMIL,

the situation permits and without compromising the security of Liberia;
