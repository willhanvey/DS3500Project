  Preventing and combating illicit brokering activities 
 
 

 The General Assembly,  

 Noting the threat to international peace and security posed by illicit brokering 
activities circumventing the international arms control and non-proliferation 
framework, 

 Concerned that, if proper measures are not taken, the illicit brokering of arms 
in all its aspects will adversely affect the maintenance of international peace and 
security, and prolong conflicts, and could be an obstacle to sustainable economic 
and social development and result in illicit transfers of conventional arms and the 
acquisition of weapons of mass destruction by non-State actors, 

 Recognizing the need for Member States to prevent and combat illicit 
brokering activities, which covers not only conventional arms but also materials, 
equipment and technology that could contribute to the proliferation of weapons of 
mass destruction and their means of delivery,  

 Reaffirming that efforts to prevent and combat illicit brokering activities 
should not hamper the legitimate arms trade and international cooperation with 
respect to materials, equipment and technology for peaceful purposes,  

 Recalling Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) of 28 April 2004, in 
particular paragraph 3, which determined that all States shall develop and maintain 
appropriate effective border controls and law enforcement efforts to detect, deter, 
prevent and combat, including through international cooperation when necessary, 
illicit trafficking and brokering of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and their 
means of delivery, in accordance with their national legal authorities and legislation 
and consistent with international law,  



A/C.1/67/L.24  
 

12-56547 2 
 

 Recalling also General Assembly resolution 65/75 of 8 December 2010,  

 Taking note of international efforts to prevent and combat illicit arms 
brokering, in particular in small arms and light weapons, as demonstrated by the 
adoption in 2001 of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the 
Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects,1 and the entry into 
force in 2005 of the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in 
Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition, supplementing the United 
Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,2  

 Noting the report of the Group of Governmental Experts established pursuant 
to General Assembly resolution 60/81 of 8 December 2005 to consider further steps 
to enhance international cooperation in preventing, combating and eradicating illicit 
brokering in small arms and light weapons3 as an international initiative within the 
framework of the United Nations,  

 Welcoming efforts to implement the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat 
and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, 
and welcoming also in this regard the outcome document of the Second United 
Nations Conference to Review Progress Made in the Implementation of the 
Programme of Action,4 including as it relates to illicit brokering of small arms and 
light weapons,  

 Underlining the inherent right of Member States to determine the specific 
scope and content of domestic regulations in accordance with their legislative 
frameworks and export control systems, consistent with international law,  

 Welcoming the efforts made by Member States to implement laws and/or 
administrative measures to regulate arms brokering within their legal systems, 

 Encouraging cooperation among Member States to prevent and combat illicit 
trafficking in nuclear materials, and recognizing in this regard existing efforts at all 
levels, including those elaborated at the 2012 Seoul Nuclear Security Summit, 
consistent with international law, 

 Encouraging Member States in a position to do so to share their experience 
and practices in relation to the control of illicit brokering and to further enhance 
international cooperation to this end,  

 Noting with satisfaction the activities of the United Nations Institute for 
Disarmament Research in relation to preventing and combating illicit brokering 
activities,  

 Acknowledging the constructive role civil society can play in raising awareness 
and providing practical expertise on the prevention of illicit brokering activities,  

 1. Underlines the commitment of Member States to address the threat posed 
by illicit brokering activities;
