 Gravely concerned that the provisions of those resolutions and relevant

United Nations system have not been implemented by the Russian Federation, 

 Recalling its resolution 3314 (XXIX) of 14 December 1974, in the annex to

Assurances in Connection with Ukraine’s Accession to the Treaty on the 

Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (Budapest Memorandum) of 5 December 

1994,1 in which, inter alia, the obligations to refrain from the threat or use of force

commitment to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of 

Ukraine were reaffirmed, 

 Deeply concerned by the illegal seizure and establishment of control by the 

Russian Federation over the former nuclear weapons storage sites in Crimea , which 

may pose a threat to regional and global security,  

 Expressing concern over the efforts of the Russian Federation to extend its 

jurisdiction over the nuclear facilities and material in Crimea,  

 Expressing concern also about the deterioration of the international security and 

arms control architecture, including as a result of the temporary occupation by the 

Russian Federation of the territories of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the 

city of Sevastopol, which has had a destabilizing impact on the international 

verification and arms control regimes, including those established by the Treaty on 

Open Skies, the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe 2 and the Vienna 

Document 2011 on Confidence- and Security-Building Measures, and rejecting the 

attempts by the Russian Federation to advance its narrative about its actions in the 

temporarily occupied Crimea through the implementation of international arms 

control regimes,  

 Affirming that the seizure of Crimea by force is illegal and a violation of 

international law, and affirming also that those territories must be immediately 

returned, 

 Recalling the prohibition, under international humanitarian law, for the 

occupying Power to compel protected persons to serve in its armed or auxiliary forces, 

including through pressure or propaganda that is aimed at securing voluntary 

enlistment, and condemning the ongoing recruitment and conscription campaigns in 

Crimea and criminal prosecutions, which include fines, correctional labour and 

imprisonment of Crimean residents for draft evasion,

3/4 20-16328 

 

 Concerned by efforts to use the education of children in Crimea in order to 

indoctrinate them to join the Russian military forces,  

 Recalling the order of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea of 

25  May 2019 on provisional measures in the Case concerning the detention of three 

Ukrainian naval vessels (Ukraine v. Russian Federation)  and Procedural Order No. 1 

of the Arbitral Tribunal Constituted under Annex VII to the 1982 United Nations 

Convention on the Law of the Sea between Ukraine and the Russian Federation in 

respect of a Dispute concerning the Detention of Ukrainian Naval Vessels and 

Servicemen of 22 November 2019,  

 Noting the fact that security concerns, the build-up of forces and the holding of 

Russian military exercises in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov regions, accompanied 

by closures of maritime routes, further destabilize the economy and social services, 

particularly in the coastal regions of Ukraine,  

 Supporting the commitment by Ukraine to adhere to international law in its 

efforts to put an end to the temporary Russian occupation of Crimea,  

 1. Urges the Russian Federation, as the occupying Power, immediately, 

completely and unconditionally to withdraw its military forces from Crimea and end 

its temporary occupation of the territory of Ukraine without delay;  

 2. Calls upon all Member States and relevant international organizations to 

cooperate with the United Nations to encourage and support efforts to put an end to 

the Russian occupation of Crimea as rapidly as possible and to refrain from any action 

or dealing with the Russian Federation regarding Crimea that is inconsistent with this 

aim; 

 3. Supports commitments and concerted efforts by the international 

community, including within international frameworks on Crimea, to address 

emerging challenges resulting from the progressive militarization of Crimea, which 

undermines security and stability in the region and beyond;  

 4. Stresses that the presence of Russian troops in Crimea is contrary to the  

national sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine and 

undermines the security and stability of neighbouring countries and the European 

region; 

 5. Reiterates its grave concern over the progressive militarization of Crimea 

by the Russian Federation as the occupying Power, and expresses concern over the 

continuing destabilization of Crimea owing to transfers by the Russian Federation of 

advanced weapon systems, including nuclear-capable aircraft and missiles, weapons, 

ammunition and military personnel to the territory of Ukraine, and urges the Russian 

Federation to stop such activity without delay;  

 6. Condemns the use of seized Ukrainian military industry enterprises in the 

occupied Crimea by the Russian Federation;  

 7. Calls upon the Russian Federation to refrain from efforts to extend its 

jurisdiction over the nuclear facilities and material in Crimea;  

 8. Expresses its deep concern over the continued conscription by the Russian 

Federation of the residents of Crimea, including those holding Ukrainian citizenship, 

into its armed forces, including assignment to military bases in the Russian 

Federation, and urges the Russian Federation to stop such activity, which contradicts 

international humanitarian law, without delay;  

 9. Calls upon the Russian Federation to refrain from establishing educational 

institutions that provide combat training to Crimean children with the stated aim of 

training for military service in the Russian armed forces, to refrain from establishing 



A/75/L.38/Rev.1 
 

 

20-16328 4/4 

 

combat training courses at Crimean schools and to cease efforts to formally 

incorporate Crimean educational institutions into the “military-patriotic” education 

system of the Russian Federation; 

 10. Reiterates its concern regarding multiple military exercises of Russian 

armed forces held in Crimea, which undermine regional security and entail 

considerable long-term negative environmental consequences in the region;  

 11. Calls upon the Russian Federation to refrain from unlawful military-

related activities in Crimea and parts of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, which 

would further exacerbate tensions in the region and beyond;  

 12. Condemns the construction by the Russian Federation of warships in the 

temporarily occupied Crimea, which further contributes to the build-up of forces and 

poses a threat to regional security and stability;  

 13. Expresses its utmost concern about the dangerous increase in tensions and 

the unjustified use of force by the Russian Federation against Ukraine, in the Black 

Sea and the Sea of Azov, including the intentional obstruction of traffic;  

 14. Calls upon the Russian Federation to return to Ukraine unconditionally 

and without delay all equipment and weapons seized from the vessels Berdyansk, 

Nikopol and the tugboat Yani Kapu during the unjustified use of force by the Russian 

Federation on 25 November 2018; 

 15. Encourages further negotiations to ensure the release by the Russian 

Federation of all illegally detained Ukrainian citizens and their safe return to Ukraine; 

 16. Calls upon the Russian Federation to refrain from impeding the lawful 

exercise of navigational rights and freedoms, exercised in accordance with applicable 

international law, including provisions of the 1982 United Nations Convent ion on the 

Law of the Sea,3 including but not limited to closure of sea areas under the pretext of 

military exercises, in the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait;  

 17. Condemns the construction and opening by the Russian Federation of the 

Kerch Strait bridge and the railway bridge, which form a part of the Tavrida highway 

project, between the Russian Federation and the temporarily occupied Crimea, which 

facilitates the further militarization of Crimea and restricts the size of ships that can 

reach the Ukrainian ports on the Azov coast;  

 18. Also condemns the increasing military presence of the Russian Federation 

in parts of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, including the Kerch Strait, and the 

harassment by the Russian Federation of commercial vessels and its restriction of 

international shipping there, which further aggravates the economic and social 

situation in the broader Donetsk region already affected by the temporary occupation 

of Crimea and subsequent ongoing destabilizing acts by the Russian Federation; 

 19. Further condemns visits of Russian officials to the temporarily occupied 

Crimea, including those in connection with conducting military exercises, military 

parades and other activities; 

 20. Calls upon all Member States, as well as international organizations and 

specialized agencies, to refrain from any visits to Crimea that are not agreed with 

Ukraine; 

 21. Decides to continue its consideration of the matter at its seventy-sixth 

session.
