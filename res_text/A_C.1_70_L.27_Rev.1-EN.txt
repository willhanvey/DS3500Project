Weapons and on Their Destruction 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of chemical weapons, in 

particular resolution 69/67 of 2 December 2014,  

 Determined to achieve the effective prohibition of the development, 

production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and their 

destruction, 

 Noting with satisfaction that, since the adoption of resolution 69/67, two 

additional States have joined the Convention, bringing the total number of States 

parties to the Convention to 192,  

 Reaffirming the broad support for the decision of the Director-General of the 

Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to send a mission to establish 

the facts surrounding the allegations of the use of toxic chemicals, reportedly 

chlorine, for hostile purposes in the Syrian Arab Republic, and re -emphasizing its 

unequivocal support for the decision of the Director General to continue the 

mission, while stressing that the safety and security of mission personnel remains 

the top priority, 

 Taking note of decision EC-M-48/DEC.1 of 4 February 2015 of the Executive 

Council of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on reports of 

the Fact-Finding Mission in Syria and Security Council resolutions 2209 (2015) of  

6 March 2015 on toxic chemicals that have been used as a weapon in the Syrian 

Arab Republic and 2235 (2015) of 7 August 2015 on the establishment and 



A/C.1/70/L.27/Rev.1 
 

 

15-18965 2/5 

 

operation of a Joint Investigative Mechanism of the United Nations and  the 

Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons,  

 Reaffirming its condemnation, in the strongest possible terms, of the use of 

chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances, emphasizing that any use of 

chemical weapons anywhere, at any time, by anyone, under any circumstances is 

unacceptable and would violate international law, and expressing its strong 

conviction that those individuals responsible for the use of chemical weapons 

should be held accountable, 

 Reaffirming the importance of the outcome of the Third Special Session of the 

Conference of the States Parties to Review the Operation of the Chemical Weapons 

Convention, held in The Hague from 8 to 19 April 2013 (the Third Review 

Conference), including its consensus final report, in which the Conference 

addressed all aspects of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, 

Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction,
1
 

and made important recommendations on its continued implementation,  

 Emphasizing that the Third Review Conference welcomed the fact that the 

Convention is a unique multilateral agreement banning an entire category of 

weapons of mass destruction in a non-discriminatory and verifiable manner under 

strict and effective international control and noted with satisfaction that the 

Convention continues to be a remarkable success and an example of effective 

multilateralism, 

 Convinced that the Convention, 18 years after its entry into force, has 

reinforced its role as the international norm against chemical weapons, and that it 

constitutes a major contribution to:  

 (a) International peace and security,  

 (b) Eliminating chemical weapons and preventing their re-emergence, 

 (c) The ultimate objective of general and complete disarmament under strict 

and effective international control,  

 (d) Excluding completely, for the sake of all mankind, the possibility of the 

use of chemical weapons, 

 (e) Promoting international cooperation and exchange in scientific and 

technical information in the field of chemical activities among States parties for 

peaceful purposes in order to enhance the economic and technological development 

of all States parties, 

 1. Emphasizes that the universality of the Convention on the Prohibition of 

the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on 

Their Destruction
1
 is essential to achieving its object and purpose and to enhancing 

the security of States parties, as well as to international peace and security, 

underlines the fact that the objectives of the Convention will not be fully realized as 

long as there remains even a single State not party to the Convention that could 

possess or acquire such weapons, and calls upon all States that have not yet done so 

to become parties to the Convention without delay;

 2. Underlines the fact that the full, effective and non-discriminatory 

implementation of all articles of the Convention makes a major contribution to 

international peace and security through the elimination of existing stockpiles of

for international cooperation for peaceful purposes in the field of chemical activities;

destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles and the destruction or conversion of 

chemical weapons production facilities in accordance with the provisions of the

purpose of the Convention; 

 5. Stresses the importance to the Convention that all possessors of chemical

 6. Recalls that the Third Special Session of the Conference of the States

Russian Federation and the United States of America, had been unable to fully meet 

the final extended deadline of 29 April 2012 for the destruction of their chemical 

weapons stockpiles, and also expressed determination that the destruction of all 

categories of chemical weapons should be completed in the shortest time possible in 

accordance with the provisions of the Convention and the Verification Annex, and 

with the full application of the relevant decisions that have been taken;  

 7. Notes with concern that, along with the threat of the possible production, 

acquisition and use of chemical weapons by States, the international community also 

faces the danger of the production, acquisition and use of chemical weapons by  

non-State actors, including terrorists, concerns which have highlighted the necessity 

of achieving universal adherence to the Convention, as well as the high level of 

readiness of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and stresses 

that the full and effective implementation of all provisions of the Convention, 

including those on national implementation (article VII) and assistance and protection 

(article X), constitutes an important contribution to the efforts of the United Nations 

in the global fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations;  

 8. Notes that the effective application of the verification system builds 

confidence in compliance with the Convention by States parties;

Syrian Arab Republic are accurate and complete, as required by the Convention and  

the decision of 27 September 2013 of the Executive Council of the Organization for 

the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons,
3
 and notes that the Executive Council 

requested the Technical Secretariat and the Syrian Arab Republic to expedite their 

efforts to resolve those gaps, inconsistencies, and discrepancies and further requested 

that the Director General provide a report to the Council at its eighty -first session that 

details all unresolved issues, in particular specifying those on which no further 

progress has been possible; 

 11. Urges all States parties to the Convention to meet in full and on time 

their obligations under the Convention and to support the Organization for the 

Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in its implementation activities;  

 12. Welcomes progress made in the national implementation of article VII 

obligations, commends the States parties and the Technical Secretariat for assisting 

other States parties, on request, with the implementation of the follow -up to the plan

manner that avoids hampering the economic or technological development of States

not prohibited under the Convention, including the international exchange of 

scientific and technical information, and chemicals and equipment for the production, 

processing or use of chemicals for purposes not prohibited under the Convention;  

 15. Emphasizes the importance of the provisions of article XI of the 

Convention relating to the economic and technological development of States 

parties, recalls that the full, effective and non -discriminatory implementation of 

those provisions contributes to universality, and reaffirms the undertaking of the
