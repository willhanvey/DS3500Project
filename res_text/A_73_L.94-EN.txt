to enhance cooperation, improve information exchange and transparency in the field 

of trade in goods used for (a) capital punishment, (b) torture or other cruel, inhuman 

or degrading treatment or punishment,  

 Recognizing that the absence of common international standards on the import, 

export and transfer of goods used for (a) capital punishment, (b) torture or other cr uel, 

inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is a contributory factor to facilitate  

the availability of these goods and enable such practices,  

 Acknowledging the growing support across all regions for concluding an 

international instrument, negotiated on a non-discriminatory, transparent and 

multilateral basis, to establish common international standards for the import, export 

and transfer of goods used for (a) capital punishment, (b) torture or other cruel, 

inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,  

 Acknowledging also the importance of international trade and the need to ensure 

that the establishment of non-discriminatory, transparent, multilaterally agreed 

common international standards for the import, export and transfer of goods used for 

(a) capital punishment, (b) torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 

punishment does not create barriers to international trade in other goods,   

 Taking note of the launching of the Alliance for Torture-Free Trade,  

 1. Requests the Secretary-General, with the provisions of resolution 72/163 

in mind, to seek the views of Member States on the feasibility and possible scope of 

a range of options to establish common international standards for the i mport, export 

and transfer of goods used for (a) capital punishment, (b) torture or other cruel, 

inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and to submit a report on the subject 

to the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session; 

 2. Also requests the Secretary-General, on the basis of his report to be 

submitted to the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session, to establish a group 

of governmental experts, to be chosen on the basis of equitable geographical 

distribution and guided by the need to appoint individuals reflecting the highest 

standards of efficiency, competence in the fields of human rights and/or international 

trade, and integrity, to examine, commencing in 2020, the feasibility, scope of the 

goods to be included and draft parameters for a range of options to establish common 

international standards on the matter and to transmit the report of the group of experts 

to the Assembly for consideration at its seventy-fifth session;  

 3. Further requests the Secretary-General to provide the group of experts 

with any assistance and services that may be required for the discharge of its task;  

 4. Decides that the cost of all activities that may arise from the 

implementation of the present resolution should be met from voluntary contributions.
