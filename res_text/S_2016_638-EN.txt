 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 

territorial integrity of the CAR, and recalling the importance of the principles of 

non-interference, good-neighbourliness and regional cooperation,  

 Reaffirming the basic principles of peacekeeping, including consent of the 

parties, impartiality, and non-use of force, except in self-defence and defence of the 

mandate; recognizing that the mandate of each peacekeeping mission is specific to 

the need and situation of the country concerned, and recalling, in this regard, its 

Presidential Statement S/PRST/2015/22 of 25 November 2015, 

 Recalling that the CAR Authorities have the primary responsibility to protect 

all populations in the CAR in particular from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing 

and crimes against humanity, 

 Emphasizing that any sustainable solution to the crisis in the CAR should be 

CAR-owned, including the political process, and should prioritize reconciliation of 

the Central African people, through an inclusive process that involves men and 

women of all social, economic, political, religious and ethnic backgrounds, 

including, those displaced by the crisis,  

 Welcoming in this regard the joint action of some domestic religious leaders at 

the national level in trying to pacify relations and end violence between religious 

communities and noting the need to amplify their voices at the local level,  

 Noting with concern that while improving, the security situation in the CAR 

remains fragile, due to the continued presence of armed groups and other armed 

spoilers, as well as the ongoing violence, the lack of capacity of the national 

security forces, and the persistence of the root causes of the conflict,

 Recalling the submission of the report (S/2014/928) of the International

elements from the CAR Armed Forces (FACA) who collaborated with armed groups 

committed violations of international humanitarian law and human rights violations 

and abuses since 1 January 2013, that may amount to war crimes and crimes against 

humanity, including ethnic cleansing by elements of the anti -Balaka militia,

urgent need for Troop- and Police-contributing countries and, as appropriate, 

MINUSCA, to promptly investigate those allegations in a credible and transparent 

manner and for those responsible for such criminal offences or misconduct to be 

held to account, and further stressing the need to prevent such exploitation and 

abuse and to improve how these allegations are addressed,  

 Emphasizing the fact that the current security situation in the CAR provides a 

conducive environment for transnational criminal activity, such as that involving 

arms trafficking and the use of mercenaries as well as a potential breeding ground 

for radical networks, 

 Expressing grave concern at the threat to peace and security in the CAR
