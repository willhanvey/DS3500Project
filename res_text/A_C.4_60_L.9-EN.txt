Aware of the continuing needs of the Palestine refugees throughout all the
fields of operation, namely Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic and the
Occupied Palestinian Territory,

Expressing grave concern at the especially difficult situation of the Palestine
refugees under occupation, including with regard to their safety, well-being and
living conditions,

Noting the signing of the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-
Government Arrangements on 13 September 1993 by the Government of Israel and
the Palestine Liberation Organization2 and the subsequent implementation
agreements,

Aware of the important role to be played in the peace process by the
Multilateral Working Group on Refugees of the Middle East peace process,

1. Notes with regret that repatriation or compensation of the refugees, as
provided for in paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), has not yet
been effected and that, therefore, the situation of the Palestine refugees continues to
be a matter of grave concern;

2. Also notes with regret that the United Nations Conciliation Commission
for Palestine has been unable to find a means of achieving progress in the
implementation of paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), and
reiterates its request to the Conciliation Commission to exert continued efforts
towards the implementation of that paragraph and to report to the Assembly as
appropriate, but not later than 1 September 2006;

3. Affirms the necessity for the continuation of the work of the United
Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and the
importance of its operation and its services for the well-being of the Palestine
refugees and for the stability of the region, pending the resolution of the question of
the Palestine refugees;

4. Calls upon all donors to continue to make the most generous efforts
possible to meet the anticipated needs of the Agency, including those mentioned in
recent emergency appeals.
