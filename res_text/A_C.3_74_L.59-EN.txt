 60. Calls upon the Office of the High Commissioner to continue to play its 

catalytic role in mobilizing assistance from the international community to address 

the root causes as well as the economic, environmental, development, security and 

social impact of large-scale refugee populations in developing countries, in particular 

the least developed countries, and countries with economies in transition, and notes 

with appreciation those host countries, donor States, organizations and individuals 

that contribute to improving the condition of refugees through building the resilience 

of refugees and their host communities, while working towards a durable solution;  

 61. Acknowledges with appreciation the cooperation of the Office of the High 

Commissioner with development partners, noting the advantages of complementarity 

of funding sources to support refugees and host communities as requested by host 

Governments, and the importance of doing so in a manner that does not negatively 

impact or reduce support for broader development objectives in host countries and, 

where appropriate, countries of origin;  

 62. Expresses concern that the needs required to protect and assist persons of 

concern to the Office of the High Commissioner continue to increase and that the gap 

between global needs and available resources continues to grow, appreciates the 

continued and increasing hospitality of host countries and generosity of donors, and 

therefore calls upon the Office to continue and enhance efforts to broaden its donor base  

so as to achieve greater burden- and responsibility-sharing by reinforcing cooperation 

with governmental donors, non-governmental donors and the private sector;  

 63. Recognizes that adequate and timely resources are essential for the Office 

of the High Commissioner to continue to fulfil the mandate conferred upon it through 

its statute10 and by subsequent General Assembly resolutions on refugees and other 

persons of concern, recalls its resolution 58/153 of 22 December 2003 and subsequent 

resolutions on the Office of the High Commissioner concerning, inter alia, the 

implementation of paragraph 20 of the statute of the Office, and urges Governments 

and other donors to respond promptly to annual and supplementary appeals issued by 

the Office for requirements under its programmes;  

 64. Requests the High Commissioner to report on his annual activities to the 

General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session.
