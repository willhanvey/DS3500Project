  France, Jordan, Lithuania, Malaysia, New Zealand, Spain, 

United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and 

United States of America: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, 

Poisonous or other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare, and the 

Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use 

of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction (CWC), and the Council’s 

resolutions 1540 (2004), 2118 (2013) and 2209 (2015),  

 Recalling that the Syrian Arab Republic acceded to the CWC, noting that the 

use of any toxic chemical, such as chlorine, as a chemical weapon in the Syrian 

Arab Republic is a violation of resolution 2118, and further noting that any such use 

by the Syrian Arab Republic would constitute a violation of the CWC,  

 Condemning in the strongest terms any use of any toxic chemical as a weapon 

in the Syrian Arab Republic and noting with outrage that civilians continue to be 

killed and injured by toxic chemicals as weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic,  

 Reaffirming that the use of chemical weapons constitutes a serious violation of 

international law, and stressing again that those individuals responsible for any use 

of chemical weapons must be held accountable,  

 Recalling its request to the Director-General of the Organisation for the 

Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the Secretary-General to report in a 

coordinated manner on non-compliance with resolution 2118,  

 Noting the letter of the Secretary-General to the President of the Security 

Council of 25 February 2015 (S/2015/138), transmitting the note of the Director-

General of the OPCW, discussing the decision of the OPCW Executive Council of 

4 February 2015 that expressed serious concern regarding the findings of the Fact -

Finding Mission (FFM) made with a high degree of confidence that chlorine has 

been used repeatedly and systematically as a weapon in the Syrian Arab Republic,  

 Noting that toxic chemicals as weapons have allegedly been used subsequent 

to the adoption on March 6 of Security Council resolution 2209 (2015),  

 Recognizing that the OPCW FFM is not mandated to reach conclusions about 

attributing responsibility for chemical weapons use,

 Recalling that, in its resolution 2118, it decided that the Syrian Arab Republic 

and all parties in Syria shall cooperate fully with the OPCW and the United Nations,  

 1. Reiterates its condemnation in the strongest terms of any use of any toxic 

chemical, such as chlorine, as a weapon in the Syrian Arab Republic;

produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile or retain chemical weapons, or, transfer, 

directly or indirectly, chemical weapons to other States or non -State actors; 

 3. Reiterates that no party in Syria should use, develop, produce, acquire, 

stockpile, retain, or transfer chemical weapons;  

 4. Expresses its determination to identify those responsible for these acts 

and reiterates that those individuals, entities, groups, or governments responsible 

for any use of chemicals as weapons, including chlorine or any other toxic chemical, 

must be held accountable, and calls on all parties in the Syrian Arab Republic to 

extend their full cooperation in this regard;  

 5. Requests the UN Secretary-General, in coordination with the OPCW 

Director-General, to submit to the Security Council, for its authorisation, within  

20 days of the adoption of this resolution, recommendations, including elements of 

Terms of Reference, regarding the establishment and operation of an OPCW -United 

Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism to identify to the greatest extent feasible 

individuals, entities, groups, or governments who were perpetrators, organisers, 

sponsors or otherwise involved in the use of chemicals as weapons, including 

chlorine or any other toxic chemical, in the Syrian Arab Republic where the OPCW 

FFM determines or has determined that a specific incident in the Syrian Arab 

Republic involved or likely involved the use of chemicals as weapons, including 

chlorine or any other toxic chemical, and expresses its intent to respond to the 

recommendations, including elements of Terms of Reference, within five days of 

receipt; 

 6. Requests further that after the Security Council has authorised the Joint 

Investigative Mechanism that the United Nations Secretary-General, in coordination 

with the OPCW Director-General, undertake without delay the steps, measures, and 

arrangements necessary for the speedy establishment and full functioning of the 

Joint Investigative Mechanism, including recruiting impartial and experienced staff 

with relevant skills and expertise in accordance with Terms of Reference and notes 

due regard should be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide of a 

geographical basis as is practicable;  

 7. Recalls that in its resolution 2118, it decided that the Syrian Arab 

Republic and all parties in Syria shall cooperate fully with the OPCW and the 

United Nations and stresses that this includes an obligation to cooperate with the 

OPCW Director-General and its FFM and the United Nations Secretary-General and 

the Joint Investigative Mechanism, that such cooperation includes full access to all 

locations, individuals, and materials in the Syrian Arab Republic that the Joint 

Investigative Mechanism deems relevant to its investigation and where it determines 

there are reasonable grounds to believe access is justified based on its assessment of 

the facts and circumstances known to it at the time, including in areas within the 

Syrian territory but outside of the control of the Syrian Arab Republic, and that such 

cooperation also includes the ability of the Joint Investigative Mechanism to 

examine additional information and evidence that was not obtained or prepared by 



 
S/2015/602 

 

3/3 15-13351 

 

the FFM but that is related to the mandate of the Joint Investigative Mechanism as 

set forth in paragraph 5; 

 8. Calls on all other States to cooperate fully with the Joint Investigative 

Mechanism and in particular to provide it and the OPCW FFM with any relevant 

information they may possess pertaining to individuals, entities, groups, or

use of chemicals as weapons, including chlorine or any other toxic chemical, in the 

Syrian Arab Republic; 

 9. Requests the FFM to collaborate with the Joint Investigative Mechanism 

from the commencement of the Joint Investigative Mechanism’s work to  provide 

full access to all of the information and evidence obtained or prepared by the FFM 

including but not limited to, medical records, interview tapes and transcripts, and 

documentary material, and requests the Joint Investigative Mechanism, with respect 

to allegations that are subject to investigation by the FFM, to work in coordination 

with the FFM to fulfil its mandate;  

 10. Requests the United Nations Secretary-General, in coordination with the 

OPCW Director-General, to present a report to the United Nations Security Council 

and inform the OPCW Executive Council as of the date the Joint Investigative 

Mechanism begins its full operations and every 30 days thereafter on the progress 

made; 

 11. Requests the Joint Investigative Mechanism to complete its first report 

within 90 days of the date on which it commences its full operations, as notified by 

the United Nations Secretary-General, and complete subsequent reports as 

appropriate thereafter and requests the Joint Investigative Mechanism to present the 

report, or reports, to the United Nations Security Council and inform the OPCW 

Executive Council; 

 12. Requests the Joint Investigative Mechanism to retain any evidence 

related to possible uses of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic other than 

those cases in which the FFM determines or has determined that a specific incident 

in the Syrian Arab Republic involved or likely involved the use of chemicals as 

weapons, including chlorine or any other toxic chemical, and to transmit that 

evidence to the FFM through the Director-General of the OPCW and to the 

Secretary-General as soon as practicable;
