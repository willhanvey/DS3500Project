 Reaffirming that States have the primary responsibility to respect, promote and 

protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the rights of the child,  

 Acknowledging the important role played by national governmental structures 

for children, including, where they exist, ministries and institutions in charge of 

child, family and youth issues and independent ombudspersons for children or other 

national institutions for the promotion and protection of the rights of the child,  

 Recognizing that the family has the primary responsibility for the nurturing 

and protection of children, in the best interests of the child, and that children, for the 

full and harmonious development of their personality, should grow up in a family 

environment and in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding,  

 Noting with appreciation the work to promote and protect the rights of the 

child carried out by all relevant organs, bodies, entities and organizations of the

holders and special procedures of the United Nations and by relevant regional 

organizations, where appropriate, and intergovernmental organizations, and

economic crisis, poverty and inequality, and reaffirming that eradicating poverty in 

all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global

challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, 

recognizing its impact beyond the socioeconomic context and the intrinsic 

interlinkage between poverty eradication and the promotion of sustainable 

development, and in this regard underlining the importance of the implementation 

of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,  

 Profoundly concerned also that the situation of children in many parts of the 

world remains critical, in an increasingly globalized environment, as a result of the 

persistence of poverty, social inequality, inadequate social and economic conditions, 

pandemics, in particular HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, non-communicable 

diseases, lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation, environmental 

damage, climate change, natural disasters, armed conflict, foreign occupation, 

displacement, violence, terrorism, abuse, all forms of exploitation, including for the 

purposes of commercial sexual exploitation of children, such as child prostitution, 

child pornography and child sex tourism and trafficking in children, including for 

the purpose of organ removal and for the transfer of organs of the child for profit, 

neglect, illiteracy, hunger, intolerance, discrimination, racism, xenophobia, gender 

inequality, disability and inadequate legal protection, and convinced that urgent and 

effective national and international action is called for,  

 Expressing deep concern that, despite the recognition of the right of the child 

to express his or her views freely on all matters affecting him or her, with his or her 

views given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child, 

children are still seldom seriously consulted and involved in such matters owing to a 

variety of constraints and impediments and that the full implementation of this right 

has yet to be fully realized,  

 Deeply concerned that children disproportionately suffer the consequences of 

discrimination, exclusion, inequality and poverty,  

 Deeply concerned also that approximately 6 million children under the age of 

5 die each year, mostly from preventable and treatable causes, owing to inadequate 

or lack of access to integrated and quality maternal, newborn and child health care 

and services, to early childbearing, as well as lack of access to health determinants, 

such as safe drinking water and sanitation, safe and adequate food and nutrition, 

including breastfeeding, and that mortality remains highest among children 

belonging to the poorest and most marginalized communities,  

 Recognizing that a strong focus is needed on poverty, deprivation and 

inequality to prevent and protect children from all forms of violence and to  promote 

the resilience of children, their families and communities,  

 Recognizing also the large and growing number of migrant children, including 

those unaccompanied or separated from their parents or primary caregivers, and 

especially those who find themselves in a vulnerable situation by attempting to 

cross international borders without the required travel documents,  

 Taking into special consideration the situation of child refugees, internally 

displaced children and child asylum seekers, in particular those unaccompanied or 

separated from their parents,

practices, and calls upon States to provide special support and to ensure equal 

access to services for those children;  

 9. Urges all States to respect, protect and promote the right of girls and 

boys to express themselves freely, and their right to be heard, to ensure that their

and the importance of involving children’s organizations and child-led initiatives;

cases of international parental or familial child abduction, encourages States to 

engage in bilateral and, when appropriate, multilateral cooperation to resolve those 

cases, and in this regard to consider accession to or ratification of the Hague 

Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction
29

 and to facilitate, 

inter alia, the return of the child to the country in which he or she resided 

immediately before the removal or retention, while taking into consideration the

in this field and by implementing their commitment, including the Sustainable

development and the promotion of peace and tolerance, as well as key to achieving

 38.  Reaffirms the human right of everyone to education, which is enshrined 

in, inter alia, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
35

 the Convention on the Rights 

of the Child, the Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labour of the

in the strongest terms of all such attacks;  

 42. Expresses its deep concern about the persistence of the gender gap in 

education, which is reflected by the fact that, according to the United Nations 

Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, nearly two thirds of the world ’s 

non-literate adults are women;  

 43. Notes with concern that child, early and forced marriage 

disproportionally affects girls who have received little or no formal education and is 

itself a significant obstacle to educational opportunities for girls and young women, 

in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to marriage and/or 

childbirth, and recognizing that educational opportunities are directly related to 

women’s and girls’ empowerment, employment and economic opportunities and to

their active participation in economic, social and cultural development, governance 

and decision-making;

investments in education are those that have achieved the highest gains in national 

income, economic growth and poverty reduction as well as in human development 

outcomes;  

 45. Also notes that the Oslo Summit on Education for Development, in its 

declaration of 7 July 2015, decided to establish the International Commission on 

Financing Global Education Opportunity, to be chaired by the United Nations 

Special Envoy for Global Education, and that the Commission will present its report

compromises learning outcomes and may lead to school dropout;  

 47. Also recognizes that a large portion of the world’s children out of school 

live in conflict-affected areas, in areas affected by communicable diseases

efforts in order to prevent the military use of schools in contravention of applicable 

international humanitarian law;
