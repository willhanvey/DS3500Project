Reaffirming that all peoples have the right to self-determination, by virtue of
which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic,
social and cultural development,

Reaffirming also that the subjection of peoples to alien subjugation,
domination and exploitation constitutes a denial of fundamental rights, is contrary to
the Charter and is an impediment to the promotion of world peace and cooperation,

Recalling that everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which
the rights and freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 can
be fully realized,

Reaffirming that there is a close relationship between disarmament and
development and that progress in the field of disarmament would considerably
promote progress in the field of development and that resources released through
disarmament measures should be devoted to the economic and social development
and well-being of all peoples, in particular those of the developing countries,

Convinced of the aim of the creation of conditions of stability and well-being
which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations based on
respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples,

Convinced also that life without war is the primary international prerequisite
for the material well-being, development and progress of countries, and for the full
implementation of the rights and fundamental human freedoms proclaimed by the
United Nations,

1. Reaffirms the solemn proclamation that the peoples of our planet have a
sacred right to peace;

2. Solemnly declares that the preservation of the right of peoples to peace
and the promotion of its implementation constitute a fundamental obligation of each
State;

3. Emphasizes that ensuring the exercise of the right of peoples to peace
demands that the policies of States be directed towards the elimination of the threat
of war, particularly nuclear war, the renunciation of the use or threat of use of force
in international relations and the settlement of international disputes by peaceful
means on the basis of the Charter of the United Nations;

4. Affirms that all States should promote the establishment, maintenance and
strengthening of international peace and security and, to that end, should do their
utmost to achieve general and complete disarmament under effective international
control, as well as to ensure that the resources released by effective disarmament
measures are used for comprehensive development, in particular that of the
developing countries;

5. Urges the international community to devote part of the resources made
available by the implementation of disarmament and arms limitation agreements to
economic and social development, with a view to reducing the ever-widening gap
between developed and developing countries, and to promote the realization of all
human rights for all;
