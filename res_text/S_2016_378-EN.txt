  France: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions and statements on the Central African Republic 

(CAR), in particular resolutions 2121 (2013), 2127 (2013), 2134 (2014) 2149 (2014), 

2181 (2014), 2196 (2015), 2212 (2015), 2217 (2015), 2262 (2016) and 2264 (2016), as 

well as resolution 2272 (2016), and the Presidential Statements S/PRST/2014/28 of  

18 December 2014 and S/PRST/2015/17 of 20 October 2015, 

 Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations 

Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic 

(MINUSCA) (S/2016/305), 

 Welcoming the peaceful organization of a constitutional referendum on  

13 December 2015 and legislative and presidential elections in December 2015, 

February and March 2016, as well as the inauguration of the president Faustin -

Archange Touadera on 30 March 2016,  

 Recognizing that the future mandate of MINUSCA needs to be adapted to the 

new circumstances stemming from the end of the Transition, in full consultation 

with the newly elected authorities,  

 Recognizing also, in this context, the need for a short extension of the mandate 

of MINUSCA to allow for a strategic review of MINUSCA as stipulated in 

paragraph 4 of the present resolution,  

 Determining that the situation in the Central African Republic continues to 

constitute a threat to international peace and security,  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 

 1. Decides to extend the mandate of MINUSCA, as set out in resolution 

2217 (2015), until 31 July 2016; 

 2. Authorizes MINUSCA to take all necessary means to carry out its 

mandate within its capabilities and areas of deployment;  

 3. Decides to extend the authorization provided by paragraph 50 of 

resolution 2217 (2015), from the date of the adoption of this resolution until the end 

of MINUSCA’s mandate as authorized in this resolution;  

 4. Requests the Secretary-General to conduct a strategic review of 

MINUSCA to ensure, in consultation with the Government of the CAR, that the 

future mandate of MINUSCA is properly configured and adapted to a post -transition 

stabilization environment that enables peacebuilding efforts in the CAR, and to 

present recommendations to the Security Council by 22 June 2016;  

 5. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
