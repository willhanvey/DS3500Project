non-proliferation is essential to international peace and security,  

 Encouraging the establishment of further nuclear-weapon-free zones, where 

appropriate, on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among States of the region 

concerned, and in accordance with the 1999 guidelines of the Disarmament 

Commission,5 adopted by consensus,

East of the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the 

Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons6 and the Final Documents of the 2000 and 

2010 Review Conferences of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 

Nuclear Weapons, and reaffirming its support for the establishment of a Middle E ast 

zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction and their 

delivery systems on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at by the States of the 

region and in accordance with the 1995 resolution on the Middle East,  

 Stressing the importance of the immediate commencement and early conclusion 

of negotiations on a treaty banning the production of fissile material for use in nuclear 

weapons or other nuclear explosive devices in the Conference on Disarmament, and 

supporting the commencement of such negotiations in accordance with document 

CD/1299 and the mandate contained therein, and voluntarily ceasing such production 

pending the entry into force of such a treaty, which not all nuclear-weapon States 

parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons have declared to 

date, 

 Recalling that it has been 25 years since the opening for signature of the 

Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,7
