ExDressina  its grave disanpointment  that, despite appeals by the
international community, certain Western States and Israel have continued to
collaborate with the racist rhgime of South Africa in the military and nuclear
fields and that some of these States have, by a ready recourse to the use of
veto, consistently frustrated every effort in the Security Council to deal
decisively with the question of South Africa,

Recalling its decision taken at the tenth special session that the
Security Council should take appropriate effective steps to prevent the
frustration of the implementation of the decision of the Organization of

repressive and aggressive purposes and as an instrument of blackmail;

3. Also condemns all forms of nuclear collaboration by any State,
corporation, institution or individual with the racist rigime of South Africa,
in particular the decision by some Member States to grant licences to several
corporations in their territories to provide equipment and technical and
maintenance services for nuclear installations in South Africa:

4. Takes note with ureat concern of recent reports that collaboration
between I.;rael and South Africa has resulted in the development by South

5. Calls v.Don the Secretary-General, with the assistance of a group of
qualified experts, to investigate those reports, bearing in mind their
implications for the implementation of the policy of denucleTtization  of
Africa and for the security of African States and, in particular, the
front-line and other neighbouring States:

6. Recruests the Secretary-General to submit a preliminary report on his
investigation to the Disarmament Commission at its substantive session in 1990
and a final report to the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session:

7. Reaffirms that the acquisition of nuclear-weapon capability by the
racist regime constitutes a very grave danger to international peace and
security and, in particular, jeopardizes the security of African States and
increases the danger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons:
