 The Security Council, 

 Taking note of the letters to the President of the Council from the Secretary-
General dated 2 November 2009 (S/2009/571) and 23 November 2009 (S/2009/601), 
attaching letters from the President of the International Criminal Tribunal for 
Rwanda (“the International Tribunal”) dated 15 October 2009 and 6 November 
2009, respectively,  

 Recalling its resolutions 955 (1994) of 8 November 1994, 1165 (1998) of 
30 April 1998, 1329 (2000) of 30 November 2000, 1411 (2002) of 17 May 2002, 
1431 (2002) of 14 August 2002, 1717 (2006) of 13 October 2006, 1824 (2008) of 
18 July 2008, 1855 (2008) of 19 December 2008, and 1878 (2009) of 7 July 2009, 

 Recalling in particular its resolutions 1503 (2003) of 28 August 2003 and 1534 
(2004) of 26 March 2004, in which the Security Council calls on the International 
Tribunal to take all possible measures to complete investigations by the end of 2004, 
to complete all trial activities at first instance by the end of 2008, and to complete 
all work in 2010, 

 Taking note of the assessment by the International Tribunal in its Completion 
Strategy Report (S/2009/587) that the Tribunal will not be in a position to complete 
all its work in 2010, 

 Recalling that in resolution 1878 (2009) the Security Council extended the 
term of office of permanent judges and ad litem judges, who are members of the 
Trial Chambers, until 31 December 2010, or until the completion of the cases to 
which they are assigned, if sooner; and decided to review the extension of the term 
of office of the permanent judges at the International Tribunal, who are members of 
the Appeals Chamber, by 31 December 2009, in light of the progress of the 
International Tribunal in the implementation of its Completion Strategy, 

 Convinced of the advisability of extending the authorization granted to the 
Secretary-General in resolution 1855 (2008) to appoint additional ad litem judges to 
the nine ad litem judges authorized by the Statute of the International Tribunal, as a 
temporary measure to enable the International Tribunal to complete trials and 
conduct additional trials as soon as possible in order to meet the goals of the 
Completion Strategy, 

 Urging the International Tribunal to take all possible measures to complete its 
work expeditiously, 



S/2009/645  
 

09-65376 2 
 

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 

 1. Underlines its intention to extend, by 30 June 2010, the terms of office of 
all trial judges at the International Tribunal based on the Tribunal’s projected trial 
schedule and the terms of office of all appeals judges until 31 December 2012, or 
until the completion of the cases to which they are assigned if sooner, and requests 
the President of the International Tribunal to submit to the Council an updated trial 
and appeals schedule, including information on the judges whose extension of the 
terms of office or redeployment to the Appeals Chamber will be sought; 

 2. Decides that in order for the International Tribunal to complete existing 
trials or conduct additional trials the total number of ad litem Judges serving at the 
International Tribunal may from time to time temporarily exceed the maximum of 
nine provided for in article 11, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the International 
Tribunal, to a maximum of twelve at any one time, returning to a maximum of nine 
by 31 December 2010; 

 3. Decides that, notwithstanding the expiry of his term of office on 
31 December 2009, Judge Erik Møse complete the Setako case which he began 
before the expiry of his term of office; and takes note of the intention of the 
International Tribunal to complete the case before the end of February 2010;  

 4. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
