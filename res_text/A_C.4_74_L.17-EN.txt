 The General Assembly, 

 Having considered the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli 

Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of 

the Occupied Territories,1  

 Deeply concerned that the Syrian Golan, occupied since 1967, has been under 

continued Israeli military occupation,  

 Recalling Security Council resolution 497 (1981) of 17 December 1981,  

 Recalling also its previous relevant resolutions, the most recent of which was 

resolution 73/100 of 7 December 2018, 

 Having considered the report of the Secretary-General submitted in pursuance 

of resolution 73/100,2  

 Recalling its previous relevant resolutions in which, inter alia, it called upon 

Israel to put an end to its occupation of the Arab territories,  

 Reaffirming once more the illegality of the decision of 14 December 1981 taken 

by Israel to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian 

Golan, which has resulted in the effective annexation of that territory,

 Reaffirming that the acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible under 

international law, including the Charter of the United Nations,  

 Reaffirming also the applicability of the Geneva Convention relative to the 

Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, 3 to the occupied 

Syrian Golan, 

 Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 237 (1967) of 14 June 1967,  

 Welcoming the convening at Madrid of the Peace Conference on the Middle East 

on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 

338 (1973) of 22 October 1973 aimed at the realization of a just, comprehensive and 

lasting peace, and expressing grave concern about the stalling of the peace process on 

all tracks, 

 1. Calls upon Israel, the occupying Power, to comply with the relevant 

resolutions on the occupied Syrian Golan, in particular Security Council resolution 

497 (1981), in which the Council, inter alia, decided that the Israeli decision to impose 

its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan was null and 

void and without international legal effect and demanded that Israel, the occupying 

Power, rescind forthwith its decision; 

 2. Also calls upon Israel to desist from changing the physical character, 

demographic composition, institutional structure and legal status of the occupied 

Syrian Golan and in particular to desist from the establishment of settlements;  

 3. Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions 

taken or to be taken by Israel, the occupying Power, that purport to alter the character 

and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void, constitute a flagrant 

violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection 

of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949,3 and have no legal effect; 

 4. Calls upon Israel to desist from imposing Israeli citizenship and Israeli 

identity cards on the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan, and from its 

repressive measures against the population of the occupied Syrian Golan;  

 5. Deplores the violations by Israel of the Geneva Convention relative to the 

Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949; 

 6. Calls once again upon Member States not to recognize any of the 

legislative or administrative measures and actions referred to above;  

 7. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its 

seventy-fifth session on the implementation of the present resolution.
