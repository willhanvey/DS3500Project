(2013), 2122 (2013), and 2242 (2015) on women, peace and security, and relevant 

statements of its Presidents, and further emphasizing that persistent barriers to their 

implementation will only be dismantled through dedicated commitment to women ’s 

participation and protection and promotion of human rights, and consistent support to 

building women’s engagement at all levels of decision-making,  

 Recalling the commitments of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action 

and reaffirming the obligations of State Parties to the Convention on the Elimination 

of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Optional Protocol thereto, urging 

states that have not yet done so to consider ratifying or acceding to them,  

 Further recalling the obligations applicable to parties to armed conflict under 

the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977,  

 Noting General Recommendation 30 of the Committee on the Elimination of 

Discrimination Against Women on Women in Conflict Prevention, Conflict and Post -

Conflict Situations, 

 Bearing in mind the Purposes and Principles of the Charter of the United Nations 

and the primary responsibility of the Security Council under the Charter for the 

maintenance of international peace and security,  

 Recognizing that States bear the primary responsibility to respect and ensure the 

human rights of all persons within their territory and subject to their jurisdiction as 

provided for by international law, and reaffirming that parties to armed conflict bear 

the primary responsibility to ensure the protection of civilians,  

 Affirming the primary role of Member States to implement fully the relevant 

provisions of Security Council resolutions on women, peace and security, and the 

important complementary role of United Nations entities and regional organizations,  

 Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General of 29 March 2019 

(S/2019/280), and remaining deeply concerned over the slow progress in addressing 

and eliminating sexual violence in situations of armed conflict in particular against 

women and children, and noting as documented in the Secretary-General’s report that 

sexual violence occurs during and after armed conflicts throughout the world,

implementation of the women, peace and security agenda, remaining deeply 

concerned by the frequent under-representation of women in many formal processes 

and bodies related to the maintenance of international peace and security, the 

relatively low number of women in senior positions in political, peace and security -

related national, regional and international institutions, the lack of adequate gender -

sensitive humanitarian responses and support for women’s leadership roles in these 

settings, insufficient financing for women, peace and security, and the resulting 

detrimental impact on the maintenance of international peace and security,  

 Expressing deep concern at the full range of threats and human rights violations 

and abuses experienced by women and girls in armed conflict and post -conflict 

situations, and recognising that women and girls are particularly at risk and are often 

specifically targeted and at an increased risk of violence in conflict and post -conflict 

situations,  

 Emphasizing that advancing gender equality and women’s political, social, and 

economic empowerment is critical to the prevention of and response to sexual 

violence in conflict and post-conflict situations, and that the safety and empowerment 

of women and girls is important for their meaningful participation in peace processes, 

preventing conflicts and rebuilding societies, and that therefore women’s protection 

and participation are inextricably linked and mutually-reinforcing as reflected by all 

previous resolutions on women, peace and security,  

 Recognizing that the disproportionate impact of sexual violence in armed 

conflict and post-conflict situations on women and girls is exacerbated by 

discrimination against women and girls and by the under-representation of women in 

decision-making and leadership roles, the impact of discriminatory laws,  the gender-

biased enforcement and application of existing laws, harmful social norms and 

practices, structural inequalities, and discriminatory views on women or gender roles 

in society, and lack of availability of services for survivors, and further affirming the 

importance of promoting gender equality by addressing these and other root causes 

of sexual violence against all women and girls as part of conflict prevention, conflict 

resolution and peacebuilding,  

 Recognizing that sexual violence in conflict occurs on a continuum of 

interrelated and recurring forms of violence against women and girls, and recognizing 

that conflict also exacerbates the frequency and brutality of other forms of gender -

based violence, 

 Recognizing national ownership and responsibility in addressing the root causes 

of sexual violence in armed conflict and post-conflict situations, and further 

recognizing that the consistent and rigorous prosecution of sexual violence crimes is 

central to deterrence and prevention, as is challenging the perceptions that sexual 

violence in armed conflict is a cultural phenomenon or an inevitable consequence of 

war or a lesser crime,  

 Reiterating the need for civilian and military leaders, to demonstrate 

commitment and political will to prevent sexual violence and enforce accountability, 

and that inaction and impunity for sexual violence crimes in conflict and post -conflict 

situation can send a message that the incidence of such crimes is tolerated,  

 Recalling the responsibilities of States to end impunity and to prosecute those 

responsible for crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, 

perpetrated against civilians and, in this regard, noting with concern that only very 

limited numbers of perpetrators of sexual violence have been brought to justice, while 

recognizing that in conflict and in post-conflict situations national justice systems 

may be significantly weakened, 



 
S/2019/328 

 

3/10 19-06718 

 

 Noting United Nations commissions of inquiry and United Nations fact -finding 

missions, as appropriate and where relevant, as mechanisms to verify and investigate 

allegations of violations and abuses of international human rights law and violations 

of international humanitarian law, and in accordance with their respective mandates 

to make recommendations to advance accountability and justice and protection for 

survivors, and, in accordance with their respective mandates and within existing 

resources, to partner with Funds and Agencies in the provision of specialised 

multi-sectoral services, 

 Recognizing the need for a survivor-centered approach in preventing and 

responding to sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict situations, further 

recognizing the need for survivors of sexual violence to receive non-discriminatory 

access to services such as medical and psychosocial care to the fullest extent 

practicable and need to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading 

treatment, and that violations of the obligations on the treatment of victims can 

amount to serious violations of international law,  

 Reiterating its deep regret that civilians continue to account for the vast majority 

of casualties in situations of armed conflict and recalling with grave concern that the 

illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light 

weapons fuel armed conflicts and have a wide range of negative human rights, 

humanitarian, development and socioeconomic consequences, in particular on the 

security of civilians in armed conflict, including the disproportionate impact on 

violence perpetrated against women and girls and exacerbating sexual and gender-

based violence in conflict,  

 Acknowledging the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty and noting the provisions 

in Article 7(4) of the Treaty that exporting States Parties shall take into account the 

risk of covered conventional arms or items being used to commit or facilitate serious 

acts of gender-based violence or serious acts of violence against women and children,  

 Recognizing the link between sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict 

situations and the illicit trade in natural resources, including so-called “conflict-

minerals” and further recognizing the need for private sector actors to ensure that 

proceeds from materials acquired for their production processes do not fund armed 

groups that perpetuate conflict and sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict 

situations, 

 Recalling the important contribution of civil society, including women leaders 

and women’s organizations, to conflict prevention, resolution, and peacebuilding, 

including preventing and responding to sexual violence in conflict, affirming the 

importance of their sustained engagement and meaningful participation in all peace 

processes and remaining deeply concerned about threats, attacks and restrictions on 

the work of civil society organizations that inhibit their ability to contribute to 

international peace and security,  

 Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political 

independence of all States in accordance with the Charter,  

 Welcoming the efforts of Member States, and recognizing the efforts of regional 

and subregional organizations, in implementing resolution 1325 (2000) and 

subsequent resolutions on Women, Peace and Security at the regional, national and 

local levels, including the development of action plans and other planning 

frameworks, with sufficient resources, and encouraging Member States to continue to 

pursue such implementation, including through strengthened monitoring, evaluation 

and coordination,  

 1. Reiterates its demand for the complete cessation with immediate effect by 

all parties to armed conflict of all acts of sexual violence and its call for these parties 

https://undocs.org/en/S/RES/1325%20(2000)


S/2019/328 
 

 

19-06718 4/10 

 

to make and implement specific time-bound commitments to combat sexual violence, 

which should include, inter alia, issuance of clear orders through chains of command 

and development of codes of conduct prohibiting sexual violence and establishment 

of related enforcement procedures to ensure accountability for breaching these orders, 

commitments by individual commanders, investigation of all credible allegations 

including on the basis of information reported by relevant UN entities and 

accountability for those responsible, unimpeded access for monitoring and p rovision 

of services and humanitarian assistance in areas under their control;  

 2. Welcomes the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General, his Special 

Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, the Team of Experts on Rule of Law 

and Sexual Violence in Conflict, Women Protection Advisers, and other relevant 

United Nations entities in seeking time-bound commitments and implementation 

plans by all parties to conflict to prevent and address all acts and forms of sexual 

violence in conflict and post-conflict situations, encourages designation of high-level 

civilian, military and police focal points, as appropriate, who will be responsible for 

the implementation of such commitments, notes further that the Secretary-General 

should give due consideration to the ongoing implementation of commitments as 

outlined above in its annual report on sexual violence in conflict , encourages a more 

systematic approach and the acceleration of such efforts and welcomes the regular 

briefings to the Security Council by the Special Representative of the Secretary-

General on Sexual Violence in Conflict in this regard;  

 3. Encourages national authorities in this context to strengthen legislation to 

foster accountability for sexual violence, stresses the critical role of the domestic 

investigation and judicial systems of member states to prevent and eliminate sexual 

violence in conflict and to ensure accountability for those responsible, and requests 

relevant United Nations entities including the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law 

and Sexual Violence established pursuant to resolution 1888 to support national 

authorities in their efforts in this regard;  

 4. Recognizes the work of the of the Informal Experts Group on Women, 

Peace and Security, as expressed in resolution 2242, and expresses its intention to 

consider its information, analysis, and recommendations, acknowledging UN 

Women’s important role in this regard, and emphasizes that sexual violence in armed 

conflict and post-conflict situations and all other aspects of the Women, Peace and 

Security agenda should continue to be addressed in this forum;  

 5. Reiterating deep concern that despite its repeated condemnation of 

violence, including sexual violence, against women and children in situations of 

armed conflict, and despite its calls addressed to all parties to armed conflict for the 

cessation of such acts with immediate effect, such acts continue to occur, often with 

impunity, and in some situations have become systematic and widespread, reaching 

appalling levels of brutality, and in this respect; requests the Secretary-General, in his 

next annual report to the Council on the implementation of Resolutions 1820 (2008), 

1888 (2009), 1960 (2010), 2106 (2013) and the present resolution, to include a gap 

assessment and recommendations, within existing resources and in close consultation, 

with all applicable UN entities, as well as Member States, and other relevant experts, 

on how the Security Council can strengthen and monitor implementation of relevant 

commitments by parties to conflict as well as on how the UN can better support local, 

national, and regional efforts to address the needs of survivors of sexual violence in 

conflict;  

 6. Requests the Secretary-General and relevant UN entities to further 

strengthen, the monitoring, analysis and reporting arrangements on conflict-related 

sexual violence established pursuant to resolution 1960 (2010), including rape in 

situations of armed conflict, post-conflict and other situations relevant to the

implementation of resolution 1888 (2009), and to consider ensuring, as appropriate, 

that these arrangements address sexual violence used as a tactic of war and as a tactic 

of terrorism, with a view to providing, within existing resources, information on the 

implementation of paragraph 1 of this resolution by parties to conflict;  

 7. Reiterates that the monitoring, analysis and reporting arrangements need 

to respect fully the integrity and specificity of the monitoring and reporting 

mechanism implemented under Security Council resolutions on children and armed 

conflict and reiterates its request to the Secretary General to continue to ensure full 

transparency, cooperation and coordination of efforts between the Special 

Representative of the Secretary General for Children and armed conflict and the 

Special Representative of the Secretary General on Sexual Violence in conflict;

post-conflict situations are included in their mandates and terms of reference, where  

relevant, and the Secretary-General to ensure that they are established and 

operationalized with the capacity and relevant expertise to address such 

considerations, and in this regard encourages the use of existing rosters of 

investigators with relevant expertise; emphasizes further that all efforts to document 

and investigate sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict situations should take 

into account the specific needs of survivors, be well-coordinated, and respect safety, 

confidentiality and informed consent of survivors as well as independence and 

impartiality, and that monitoring and investigation strategies are connected to 

specialized multi-sectoral referral pathways to services for survivors;  

 9. Encourages the continued strengthening of efforts to monitor and 

document sexual violence in armed conflict and post-conflict situations and, as an 

integral part of these efforts, calls for a more systematic, reliable and rigorous 

approach to gathering accurate, reliable timely and sex-disaggregated information on 

sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict situations, in such a way that will not put 

at risk survivors; 

 10. Urges existing Sanctions Committees, where within the scope of the 

relevant criteria for designation, and consistent with the present and other relevant 

resolutions to apply targeted sanctions against those who perpetrate and direct sexual

sanctions in situations of armed conflict, to consider including designation criteria 

pertaining to acts of rape and other forms of sexual violence;  

 11. Encourages the Secretary General to ensure that expert groups and 

monitoring teams and panels for sanctions committees include members with 

dedicated sexual violence and gender expertise, and include information on incidents, 

patterns, trends and perpetrators of sexual violence in conflict and post -conflict 

situations in their reports and recommendations to committees, where mandated;  

 12. Calls upon all peacekeeping and other relevant United Nations missions 

and United Nations entities, in particular the Working Group on Children and Armed 

Conflict, the Special Representative of the Secretary General for Children and Armed 

Conflict, and the Special Representative of the Secretary General on Sexual Violence 

in Conflict, to share with relevant United Nations Security Council Sanctions 

Committees, including through their monitoring groups and groups of experts, all 

pertinent information about sexual violence, and further calls upon them to strengthen 

their cooperation and exchange of information in this regard;  

 13. Recognizes the need to integrate the prevention, response and elimination 

of sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict situations and addressing its root

 14. Calls upon Member States in the context of justice sector reform efforts, 

to strengthen legislation and enhance investigation and prosecution of sexual violence 

in conflict and post-conflict situations consistent with fair trial guarantees under 

international law, which could include enacting, if not yet established, victim and 

witness protection laws and providing, where appropriate, legal aid for survivors, and 

establishing, where appropriate, specialized police units and courts to address such 

crimes, removing procedural impediments to justice for victims such as restrictive 

limitation periods for filing claims, corroboration requirements that discriminate 

against victims as witnesses and complainants, exclusion or discrediting of victims ’ 

testimony by law enforcement officials and within judicial and other proceedings, and 

lack of facilities for closed hearings; and encourages concerned Member States to 

draw upon the expertise of the United Nations Team of Experts established pursuant 

to resolution 1888 (2009) under the strategic leadership of the Special Representative 

of the Secretary-General o Sexual Violence in Conflict as appropriate to strengthen 

the rule of law and the capacity of civilian and military justice systems to address 

sexual violence in armed conflict and post-conflict situations as part of broader efforts 

to strengthen institutional safeguards against impunity;  

 15. Urges Member States to strengthen access to justice for victims of sexual 

violence in conflict and post-conflict situations, including women and girls, who are 

particularly targeted, including through the prompt investigation, prosecution and 

punishment of perpetrators of sexual and gender-based violence, as well as 

reparations for victims as appropriate, acknowledges the inclusion of sexual and 

gender-related crimes among the most serious crimes of international concern in the 

Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which entered into force on 1 July 

2002, notes that the fight against impunity for the most serious crimes of international 

concern committed against women and girls has been strengthened through the work 

of international and mixed tribunals, as well as specialized chambers in national 

tribunals and reiterates its intention to continue forcefully to fight impunity and 

uphold accountability with appropriate means;  

 16. Encourages Member States to adopt a survivor-centered approach in 

preventing and responding to sexual violence in conflict and post -conflict situations, 

ensuring that prevention and response are non-discriminatory and specific, and 

respect the rights and prioritize needs of survivors, including groups that are 

particularly vulnerable or may be specifically targeted,  and notably in the context of 

their health, education, and participation, and in this regard the Council: 

 a. Calls upon all Member States to ensure that survivors of sexual and 

gender-based violence in conflict in the respective countries receive the care required 

by their specific needs and without any discrimination;  

 b. Notes the link between sexual violence in armed conflict and post-conflict 

situations and HIV infection, and the disproportionate burden of HIV and AIDS on 

women and girls as a persistent obstacle and challenge to gender equality;  

 c. Encourages leaders at the national and local level, including community, 

religious and traditional leaders, as appropriate and where they exist, to play a more

active role in advocating within communities against sexual violence in conflict to 

avoid marginalization and stigmatization of survivors and their families, as well as, 

to assist with their social and economic reintegration and that of their children, and 

to address impunity for these crimes;  

 d. Encourages concerned Member States to ensure the opportunity for the 

full and meaningful participation of survivors of sexual and gender-based violence at 

all stages of transitional justice processes, including in decision-making roles, 

recognizes that women’s leadership and participation will increase the likelihood that 

transitional justice outcomes will constitute effective redress as defined by victims 

and will respond to important contextual factors;  

 17. Recalls the applicable provisions of international law on the right to an 

effective remedy for violations of human rights, calls upon Member States to make 

such effective remedy and assistance available to victims of sexual violence in 

conflict, and post-conflict situations, and encourages Member States and other 

relevant actors to give due consideration to the establishment of a survivors ’ fund; 

 18. Recognizes that women and girls who become pregnant as a result of 

sexual violence in armed conflict, including those who choose to become mothers, 

may have different and specific needs, and noting the connected, distinct, sometimes 

life threatening and enduring risks and harms often faced by those women, girls and 

their children born as result of sexual violence in conflict, including economic and 

social marginalization, physical and psychological injury, statelessness, 

discrimination and lack of access to reparations; and urging states to recognize the 

equal rights of all individuals affected by sexual violence in armed conflict, including 

women, girls and children born of sexual violence in armed conflict, in national 

legislation, consistent with their obligations under the Convention on the Elimination 

of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the Convention on the Rights of 

the Child, as applicable, further requests the Secretary-General to report to the 

Security Council on these issues within two years and no later than the end of 2021 

and requests the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Children and 

Armed Conflict to cooperate with the Special Representative on Sexual Viole nce in 

Conflict and other relevant UN entities on that matter;  

 19. Recognizes the importance of supporting, and promoting civil society, 

especially local, grassroots, women-led organizations, and religious and community 

leaders, girls- and youth-led organizations, for all prevention and response efforts; 

while supporting community mobilization campaigns to help shift the stigma of 

sexual violence from the victims to the perpetrators, and to promote cohesion among 

community members where state security presence is weak; 

 20. Encourages concerned Member States and relevant United Nations 

entities to support capacity building for women-led and survivor-led organizations 

and build the capacity of civil society groups to enhance informal community-level 

protection mechanisms against sexual violence in conflict and post -conflict 

situations, to increase their support of women’s active and meaningful engagement in 

peace processes to strengthen gender equality, women’s empowerment and protection 

as a means of conflict prevention; 

 21. Welcomes the regular briefings by women from civil society, particularly 

in country-specific meetings, which has enlightened the Council on conditions in 

conflict countries including in relation to sexual violence, and calls upon States to 

condemn acts of discrimination, harassment and violence against civil society, and 

journalists who report on sexual violence in conflict and who are important to 

changing norms on roots causes, namely structural gender inequality and 

discrimination, and develop and put in place measures to protect them and enable 

them to do their work; 



S/2019/328 
 

 

19-06718 8/10 

 

 22. Requests the Secretary-General to ensure the timely deployment of Women 

Protection Advisers to relevant UN peace operations particularly at a senior level, 

ensuring that they have direct access to senior leadership of such peace operations, 

and offices of UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinators in all relevant situations 

of concern, to advise UN senior leadership on the implementation of the operational 

provisions of this resolution and other Security Council resolutions on sexual violence 

in conflict, including engagement with parties to conflict for time-bound 

commitments and establishment and functioning of the monitoring, analysis and 

reporting arrangements on conflict-related sexual violence, and takes note with 

appreciation of the Secretary-General’s gender parity strategy;  

 23. Reiterates its intention when establishing and renewing the mandates of 

United Nations missions, to include provisions on the promotion of gender equality 

and the empowerment of women in conflict and post-conflict situations, including 

through the appointment of gender advisers as appropriate, and further expresses its 

intention to include provisions to facilitate women’s full and effective participation 

and protection in: election preparation and political processes, disarmament,

wider post-conflict reconstruction processes where these are mandated tasks  within 

the mission;  

 24. Recognizes the role of United Nations peacekeeping contingents in 

preventing sexual violence, and, in this respect, calls for pre-deployment and in-

training on sexual and gender-based violence and encourages integration of this 

competence into the performance and operational readiness standards against which 

troops and police are assessed; 

 25. Welcomes the Secretary-General’s decision that all state actors repeatedly 

listed in the annexes of his reports on Sexual Violence in Conflict and Children and 

Armed Conflict are prohibited from participating in United Nations peacekeeping 

operations, and urges those troop- and police-contributing countries that are currently 

listed to cease such violations and abuses, and expeditiously implement action plans 

in accordance with paragraph 1 of this resolution, thereby avoiding suspension from 

peace operations;  

 26. Calls upon Member States and the United Nations to support affected 

countries to address sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict situations in the 

context of security sector reform processes including to enhance the capacity of 

military structures to address and prevent sexual violence related crimes, and put in 

place safeguards through vetting to prevent individuals credibly suspected of

should have access to national relief and reparations programmes, as well as health 

care, psychosocial care, safe shelter, livelihood support and legal aid and that services

barriers to support services, and in accordance with international refugee law and 

international human rights law, as applicable, sexual violence in armed conflict and 

post-conflict situations may constitute a gender related form of persecution for the 

purposes of determining eligibility asylum or refugee status; encourages Member

measures to mitigate the risk of sexual violence, to make services available to 

survivors, and to provide the option of documenting their cases for future 

accountability processes;

States to protect victims who are men and boys through the strengthening of policies 

that offer appropriate responses to male survivors and challenge cultural assumptions 

about male invulnerability to such violence; requests further that the monitoring, 

analysis and reporting arrangements on conflict-related sexual violence focus more 

consistently on the gender specific nature of sexual violence in conflict and post -

conflict situations against all affected populations in all situations of concern, 

including men and boys;
