of 22 May 2003, 1540 (2004) of 28 April 2004 and 1546 (2004) of 8 June 2004, 

 Expressing gratitude to the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and 
Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) for their important and comprehensive contributions under the relevant 
resolutions, noting the accumulation of expertise, experience and maintenance of a 
roster of experts during UNMOVIC’s mandate, and encouraging Member States to 
maintain similar expertise for the future, 

 Acknowledging that a democratically elected and constitutionally based 
Government of Iraq is now in place, noting the Government of Iraq’s declaration of 
support for the international non-proliferation regime, and welcoming the concrete 
steps taken in this regard, including the commitment enshrined in the Permanent 
Constitution and the establishment of the National Monitoring Directorate with 
responsibility for import/export control,  

 Recalling Iraq’s disarmament obligations under relevant resolutions, its 
obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, its IAEA 
Safeguards Agreement, The Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, 
Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and 
on their Destruction and the Geneva Protocol, noting Iraq’s commitment to detect, 
deter, prevent and combat, including through international cooperation when 
necessary, the illicit trafficking and brokering in nuclear, chemical and biological 
weapons and their means of delivery and related materials, in accordance with its 
legal authorities and legislation and consistent with international law, and urging its 
adherence to all applicable disarmament and non-proliferation treaties, notably the 
Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use 
of Chemical Weapons, and an Additional Protocol to the IAEA Safeguards 
Agreement,  



S/2007/390  
 

07-40539 2 
 

 Noting disarmament efforts regarding Iraq since 1991, and further noting the 
joint US-UK letter dated 28 June 2007 and the Government of Iraq letter to the 
Security Council dated 8 April 2007 annexed to this resolution,

compliance with its obligations under the relevant resolutions,  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 

 1. Decides to terminate immediately the mandates of UNMOVIC and the 
IAEA under the relevant resolutions;  

 2. Reaffirms Iraq’s disarmament obligations under relevant resolutions, 
acknowledges Iraq’s constitutional commitment to the non-proliferation, 
non-development, non-production and non-use of nuclear, chemical, and biological 
weapons and associated equipment, material, and technologies for use in the 
development, manufacture, production and use of such weapons, as well as delivery 
systems, and urges Iraq to continue to implement this commitment and to adhere to 
all applicable disarmament and non-proliferation treaties and related international 
agreements;  

 3. Invites the Government of Iraq to report to the Security Council within 
one year on progress made in adhering to all applicable disarmament and 
non-proliferation treaties and related international agreements, notably the 
Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use 
of Chemical Weapons, an Additional Protocol to its Safeguards Agreement, and on 
progress made by the National Monitoring Directorate and the Government of Iraq 
with regard to dual-use controls and harmonizing Iraqi export legislation with 
international standards;  

 4. Takes note of the summary briefings provided by UNMOVIC/UNSCOM 
and IAEA on their respective activities in Iraq since 1991, and expresses 
appreciation for their dedicated work; 

 5. Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary measures to provide 
for the appropriate disposition of UNMOVIC’s archives and other property under 
arrangements ensuring, in particular, that sensitive proliferation information or 
information provided in confidence by Member States is kept under strict control, 
and further requests that the Secretary-General inform the Security Council within 
three months on steps taken in this regard; 

 6. Requests the Secretary-General to transfer to the Government of Iraq 
through the Development Fund for Iraq not later than three months from the date of 
this resolution, all remaining unencumbered funds in the account established 
pursuant to paragraph 8 (e) of resolution 986 (1995), after returning to Member 
States at their request contributions made by them pursuant to paragraph 4 of 
resolution 699 (1991);

Annex I 
 

  Letter from the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth 
Affairs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland and Secretary of State of the United States of America 
to the United Nations addressed to the President of the  
Security Council 

 
 

 The United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland wish to inform the Security Council of the steps that have been taken 
with regard to ensuring Iraqi compliance with its disarmament obligations, as called for in 
Council resolution 1483 (2003). 

 Together with the Government of Iraq and other Member States, the United States 
and the United Kingdom, pursuant to the letter dated 8 May 2003 from their Permanent 
Representatives to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council 
(S/2003/538), have been working since March 2003 with the objective of locating and 
securing, removing, disabling, rendering harmless, eliminating or destroying weapons of 
mass destruction, ballistic missiles and related delivery systems and programmes in Iraq 
developed under the regime of Saddam Hussein. 
 We wish to inform the Security Council that all appropriate steps have been taken to 
secure, remove, disable, render harmless, eliminate or destroy (a) all of Iraq’s known 
weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles with a range of greater than 150 
kilometres and (b) all known elements of Iraq’s programmes established to research, 
develop, design, manufacture, produce, support, assemble and employ such weapons and 
delivery systems, subsystems and components thereof. 
 Furthermore, we wish to draw the attention of the Security Council to the 
conclusions of the report issued by the Special Advisor to the United States Director of 
Central Intelligence on Iraq’s Weapons of Mass Destruction (“the Duelfer Report”) 
following a review of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction programmes, undertaken by 
drawing upon information received from former Iraqi officials, other Iraqi citizens, 
suspected weapon sites and both technical and procurement-related documents. In the 
course of their investigation, Iraq Survey Group analysts visited suspected weapons-
related sites and searched through documents. The report and its addenda are available 
from the following website: https://www.cia.gov/library/ reports/general-reports-
1/iraq_wmd_2004/index.html. 

 The letter dated 24 April 2007 from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq to the 
President of the Security Council (S/2007/236, annex) outlines additional actions that Iraq 
has taken and other actions that it intends to take in the near future to demonstrate and 
affirm to the international community its belief that it is now in full compliance with its 
disarmament obligations under the relevant Council resolutions.

Annex II 
 

  Letter dated 8 April 2007 from the Minister for  
Foreign Affairs of Iraq addressed to the President  
of the Security Council 
 

[Original: Arabic] 
 

 I have the honour to address the present letter to you, and through you to the 
other members of the Security Council, requesting, on behalf of the Government of 
Iraq, that the Council consider terminating the mandates of the United Nations 
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) and the Iraq 
Action Team of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) established by the 
Security Council resolutions on the elimination and removal of former Iraqi 
weapons of mass destruction, as there are no longer any legal or technical grounds 
for continuing their mandate and we are certain that Iraq currently has none of the 
programmes or weapons in question. In this connection, please note the following:  

 1. Today Iraq has a democratically elected Government and a new 
Parliament in addition to a Constitution that has been approved by the Iraqis. Today 
it declares that it is joining the global democratic community in its support for the 
international non-proliferation regime.  

 2. Article 9 (e) of the Permanent Constitution of the Government of Iraq 
states that: “The Iraqi Government shall respect and implement Iraq’s international 
obligations regarding the non-proliferation, non-development, non-production and 
non-utilization of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and shall prohibit 
associated equipment, materiel, technologies and communication systems for use in 
the development, manufacture, production and utilization of such weapons”. This 
Constitution was approved by the Iraqi people in the national referendum held in 
2005.  

 3. As Security Council members know, the Iraqi Government has 
cooperated fully with the Iraq Survey Group (ISG) in respect of the former regime’s 
weapons programme.  

 4. Today the Iraqi Government affirms its full commitment to the relevant 
Security Council resolutions and, in that connection, reiterates the request that it 
made to the President of the Council in March 2005, as well as the letter from the 
Iraqi Prime Minister of 11 November 2006 calling for the termination of the 
mandates of UNMOVIC and the IAEA Iraq Action Team.  

 5. The Iraqi Government reiterates its commitment to the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the safeguards agreement of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, the Biological Weapons Convention and the 
1925 Geneva Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, 
Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare. The 
provisional Iraqi Government announced previously in July 2004 its commitment to 
all the agreements and conventions on the prevention of proliferation. The Iraqi 
technical authorities have elaborated a draft law on Iraq’s accession to the Chemical 
Weapons Convention, which is currently before the Parliament — the country’s 
legislative branch — with a view to its adoption and preparations are under way for 



 S/2007/390
 

5 07-40539 
 

accession to the Model Additional Protocol of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency’s safeguards regime.  

 6. With regard to coordination with IAEA on a code of conduct on the 
safety and security of radioactive sources in Iraq, Iraq has set up an agency 
responsible for identifying radioactive sources in Iraq and guaranteeing their 
security, namely, the Iraqi Radioactive Sources Regulatory Authority. Since the fall 
of the previous regime, IAEA has made four successful verification visits to the 
Tuwaitha site — in June 2003, August 2004, September 2005 and, most recently, in 
November 2006.  

 7. The Iraqi National Monitoring Directorate is overseeing the transfer of 
dual-use substances and is now making every effort to harmonize Iraqi export 
legislation with international standards. Iraq has submitted its national report in 
accordance with its obligations under Security Council resolution 1540 (2004).  

 8. The Iraqi Government has undertaken to guarantee the security of its 
borders by strengthening controls in cooperation with the multinational force.  

 The Government and people of my country hope that the Security Council will 
make a serious and objective assessment of the situation in Iraq — namely, the 
absence of weapons of mass destruction and related programmes — and take the 
appropriate decision to terminate the mandate of UNMOVIC and the IAEA Iraq 
Action Team and transfer the balance in the Iraq account opened by the United 
Nations to the Development Fund for Iraq, for the purposes of investment.  

 I should be grateful if you would have the text of the present letter circulated 
to the members of the Security Council as a document of the Security Council.
