 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming its resolutions 1261 (1999) of 25 August 1999, 1314 (2000) of 
11 August 2000, 1379 (2001) of 20 November 2001, 1460 (2003) of 30 January 2003, 
1539 (2004) of 22 April 2004, 1612 (2005) of 26 July 2005, 1882 (2009) of 
4 August 2009, 1998 (2011) of 12 July 2011 and 2068 (2012) of 19 September 2012, 
and the Statements of its President on 24 July 2006 (S/PRST/2006/33), 28 November 
2006 (S/PRST/2006/48), 12 February 2008 (S/PRST/2008/6), 17 July 2008 
(S/PRST/2008/28), 29 April 2009 (S/PRST/2009/9), 16 June 2010 (S/PRST/2010/10) 
and 17 June 2013 (S/PRST/2013/8), which contribute to a comprehensive framework 
for addressing the protection of children affected by armed conflict,  

 Acknowledging that its resolutions 1612 (2005), 1882 (2009), 1998 (2011) and 
2068 (2012) and the Statements of its President on children and armed conflict have 
generated progress in preventing and responding to violations and abuses committed 
against children, in particular in the demobilization, rehabilitation and reintegration 
of thousands of children, the signing of action plans between parties to armed 
conflict and the United Nations and the delisting of parties to conflict from the 
Annexes to the Secretary-General’s annual report,  

 Remaining however deeply concerned over the lack of progress on the ground 
in some situations of concern, where parties to conflict continue to violate with 
impunity the relevant provisions of applicable international law relating to the rights 
and protection of children in armed conflict,  

 Recalling that all parties to armed conflict must comply strictly with the 
obligations applicable to them under international law for the protection of children 
in armed conflict, including those contained in the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child and its Optional Protocol on the involvement of Children in armed conflict, as

well as the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and their Additional Protocols of 
1977,  

 Noting that Article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes 
the right of the child to education and sets forth obligations for State parties to the 
Convention, with a view to progressively achieving this right on the basis of equal 
opportunity,  

 Expressing deep concern about the military use of schools by armed forces and 
non-State armed groups in contravention of applicable international law, including 
those involving their use as military barracks, weapons storage facilities, command 
centres, detention and interrogation sites and firing and observation positions,  

 Expressing further concern regarding the high number of children that are 
being killed and maimed in conflict and post-conflict situations by landmines, 
explosive remnants of war, improvised explosive devices and other unexploded 
ordnance,  

 Convinced that the protection of children in armed conflict should be an 
important aspect of any comprehensive strategy to resolve conflict and build peace,  

 Recalling the responsibility of all Member States to comply with their 
respective obligations to end impunity and to investigate and prosecute those 
responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other egregious 
crimes perpetrated against children; and noting that the fight against impunity for 
the most serious crimes of international concern committed against children has 
been strengthened through the work on and prosecution of these crimes by the 
International Criminal Court, ad hoc and mixed tribunals and specialized chambers 
in national tribunals,  

 Acknowledging the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty and noting that in line 
with the provisions in Article 7(4) of the Treaty exporting States Parties shall take 
into account the risk of covered conventional arms or items being used to commit or 
facilitate serious acts of violence against children,  

 Reiterating its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international 
peace and security and, in this connection, its commitment to address the 
widespread impact of armed conflict on children,  

 Stressing the primary role of Governments in providing protection and relief to 
all children affected by armed conflict, recognizing the importance of strengthening 
national capacities in this regard and reiterating that all action undertaken by United 
Nations entities within the framework of the monitoring and reporting mechanism 
must be designed to support and supplement, as appropriate, the protection and 
rehabilitation roles of national Governments,  

 Recognizing further that capacity-building for the protection of children 
affected by armed conflict is a process that must begin from the earliest days of 
international engagement,  

 Emphasizing the vital role of the United Nations, in consultations with 
international partners, to support national authorities in consolidating peace and in 
developing strategies for peacebuilding priorities as well as to ensure that these 
strategies strengthen coherence between political, security, human rights, 
development and rule of law activities,  



 S/2014/149
 

3/7 14-25624 
 

 Recognizing the crucial role of child protection advisers in mainstreaming 
child protection and leading monitoring, prevention and reporting efforts in relevant 
United Nations peacekeeping missions, political missions and peacebuilding offices 
in accordance with their mandate, including advice for and close cooperation and 
coordination between the missions, UNICEF and specialized NGOs for child 
demobilization and integration and prevention of recruitment,  

 Underlining the importance of providing military, police and civilian 
peacekeepers with adequate predeployment and in-mission training on mission-
specific child protection issues and on appropriate comprehensive prevention and 
protection responses,  

 Recognizing the valuable contribution of relevant regional and subregional 
organizations and arrangements for the protection of children affected by armed 
conflict and commending in this regard the declaration signed on 17 September 
2013 between the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for 
Children and Armed Conflict and the Peace and Security Department of the African 
Union Commission, in order to mainstream protection mechanisms in all peace and 
security activities of the African Union, in close partnership with UNICEF, as well 
as the EU Guidelines on Children and Armed Conflict, including its Checklist for 
the integration of the protection of children affected by armed conflict into EU 
Common Security and Defense Policy operations and the development by NATO, in 
close collaboration with the DPKO and the Office of the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General, of training courses and military guidelines on Children and 
Armed Conflict,  

 1. Strongly condemns all violations of applicable international law 
involving the recruitment and use of children by parties to armed conflict, as well as 
their re-recruitment, killing and maiming, rape and other sexual violence, 
abductions, attacks against schools or hospitals and denial of humanitarian access by 
parties to armed conflict and all other violations of international law, including 
international humanitarian law, human rights law and refugee law, committed 
against children in situations of armed conflict and demands that all relevant parties 
immediately put an end to such practices and take special measures to protect 
children;  

 2. Calls on Member States to devise ways, in close consultations with the 
United Nations country-level task force on monitoring and reporting and United 
Nations country teams, to facilitate the development and implementation of time-
bound action plans, and the review and monitoring by the United Nations country-
level task force of obligations and commitments relating to the protection of 
children affected by armed conflict;  

 3. Reiterates the value of interministerial committees as a successful 
framework for partnership with concerned Governments to discuss and follow-up on 
child protection commitments and encourages these Governments with the support 
of the United Nations to utilize these committees to foster action plan 
implementation;  

 4. Stresses the importance of regular and timely consideration of violations 
and abuses committed against children in armed conflict, including through 
incorporating, where appropriate, a children and armed conflict dimension in the 
terms of reference of Security Council field visits, and invites its Working Group on 



S/2014/149  
 

14-25624 4/7 
 

Children and Armed Conflict to make full use of its toolkit (S/2006/724) in light of 
ongoing discussions on enhancing compliance, and in this regard to continue 
considering the issue of persistent perpetrators and action plan implementation;  

 5. Recalls the fact that the conscription or enlistment of children under the 
age of 15 or using them to participate actively in hostilities in both international and 
non-international armed conflict constitutes a war crime under the Rome Statute of 
the International Criminal Court, and notes that the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed 
conflict requires State parties to set a minimum age of 18 for compulsory 
recruitment and participation in hostilities and to raise the minimum age for 
voluntary recruitment from that set out in article 38, paragraph 3, of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child and to take all feasible measures to ensure that members 
of their armed forces who have not attained the age of 18 years do not take a direct 
part in hostilities;  

 6. Welcomes in this context the campaign “Children, Not Soldiers” initiated 
by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed 
Conflict and UNICEF, in collaboration with other United Nations partners, with a 
view to end and prevent the recruitment and use of children by Government armed 
forces in conflict by 2016;  

 7. Urges in this regard concerned Governments to undertake all efforts in 
order to ensure that no children are in their ranks in conflict, in particular through 
the development and implementation of time-bound action plans; calls on Member 
States, all relevant United Nations entities, NGOs and the donor community to 
support in their various capacities the campaign “Children, Not Soldiers”, 
recognizing that its goal can only be attained through partnership and active 
involvement of all;  

 8. Invites the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children 
and Armed Conflict to inform the Security Council about the campaign “Children, 
Not Soldiers”, including about process and progress in delisting concerned parties;  

 9. Further urges Member States, United Nations entities and other parties 
concerned to ensure that child protection provisions, including those relating to the 
release and reintegration of children formerly associated with armed forces or armed 
groups, are integrated into all peace negotiations and peace agreements;  

 10. Reiterates the Security Council’s readiness to adopt targeted and 
graduated measures against persistent perpetrators of violations and abuses 
committed against children, taking into account the relevant provisions of its 
resolutions 1539 (2004), 1612 (2005), 1882 (2009), 1998 (2011) and 2068 (2012) 
and to consider including provisions pertaining to parties to armed conflict that 
engage in activities in violation of applicable international law relating to the rights 
and protection of children in armed conflicts, when establishing, modifying or 
renewing the mandate of relevant sanctions regimes;  

 11. Stresses the need to exclude genocide, crimes against humanity, war 
crimes and other egregious crimes perpetrated against children from amnesty laws 
and other similar provisions and strongly encourages concerned States to establish a 
vetting mechanism to ensure that those responsible for such crimes are not included 
in the ranks of the army or other security forces;

 12. Emphasizes the responsibility of all States to put an end to impunity and 
to investigate and prosecute those responsible for genocide, crimes against 
humanity, war crimes and other egregious crimes perpetrated against children and 
highlights in this regard the contribution of the International Criminal Court, in 
accordance with the principle of complementarity to national criminal jurisdictions 
as set out in the Rome Statute;  

 13. Urges concerned Member States, when undertaking security sector 
reforms, to mainstream child protection, such as the establishment of child 
protection units in national security forces and of effective age assessment 
mechanisms to prevent underage recruitment while stressing in this regard the 
importance of ensuring universal birth registration, including late birth registration;  

 14. Urges further all parties concerned, including Member States, United 
Nations entities, as well as financial institutions to support, as appropriate, bearing 
in mind national ownership, the development and strengthening of the capacities of 
national institutions and local civil society networks for advocacy, protection and 
rehabilitation of children affected by armed conflict as well as national 
accountability mechanisms, including building investigative and prosecutorial 
capacities and the adoption of legislation criminalizing violations and abuses 
committed against children affected by armed conflict;  

 15. Reiterates its request to the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General to pursue efforts to coalesce the donor community in order to address 
funding gaps, and encourages bilateral, regional and international partners to 
provide financial and capacity-building support in this regard, including for 
education during the conflict and post-conflict periods;  

 16. Recalls the importance of ensuring that children continue to have access 
to basic services during the conflict and post-conflict periods, including, inter alia, 
education and health care;  

 17. Reiterates its deep concern about attacks as well as threats of attacks in 
contravention of applicable international law against schools and/or hospitals, and 
protected persons in relation to them as well as the closure of schools and hospitals 
in situations of armed conflict as a result of attacks and threats of attacks and urges 
all parties to armed conflict to refrain from actions that impede children’s access to 
education and to health services;  

 18. Expresses deep concern at the military use of schools in contravention of 
applicable international law, recognizing that such use may render schools 
legitimate targets of attack, thus endangering children’s and teachers’ safety as well 
as children’s education and in this regard:  

 (a) Urges all parties to armed conflict to respect the civilian character of 
schools in accordance with international humanitarian law;  

 (b) Encourages Member States to consider concrete measures to deter the 
use of schools by armed forces and armed non-State groups in contravention of 
applicable international law;  

 (c) Urges Member States to ensure that attacks on schools in contravention 
of international humanitarian law are investigated and those responsible duly 
prosecuted;  



S/2014/149  
 

14-25624 6/7 
 

 (d) Calls upon United Nations country-level task forces to enhance the 
monitoring and reporting on the military use of schools;  

 19. Recalls the obligations of all parties to an armed conflict, in accordance 
with international humanitarian law, to ensure that the wounded and sick, including 
children, receive, to the fullest extent practicable and with the least possible delay, 
the medical care and attention required by their condition, and to respect and protect 
medical and health personnel, facilities, transports and activities in accordance with 
international humanitarian law;  

 20. Recommends that Member States include child protection in military 
training and standard operating procedures, as well as in military guidance as 
appropriate; recommends further that United Nations entities and United Nations 
peacekeeping troop- and police-contributing countries undertake targeted and 
operational trainings for the preparation of United Nations mission personnel 
including troop and police contingents on their contribution in preventing violations 
against children so as to give all mission personnel the ability to effectively 
recognize, report and respond to violations and abuses committed against children 
and to successfully support child protection activities for better implementation of 
their respective mandates;  

 21. Urges all United Nations entities, including peacekeeping missions, 
political missions, peacebuilding offices, United Nations offices, agencies, funds 
and programmes to give full attention to violations against children in the 
application of the human rights due diligence policy on United Nations support to 
non-United Nations security forces;  

 22. Urges also Member States, United Nations entities, including the 
Peacebuilding Commission and other parties concerned to ensure that post-conflict 
recovery and reconstruction planning, programmes and strategies give due priority 
to issues concerning children affected by armed conflict;  

 23. Urges relevant United Nations entities to continue to take concrete steps 
to reduce the impact of mines, unexploded ordnance and cluster munition and 
explosive remnants of war on children by prioritizing mine clearance, risk education 
and risk reduction activities;  

 24. Decides to continue the inclusion of specific provisions for the protection 
of children in the mandates of all relevant United Nations peacekeeping operations 
and political missions, encourages deployment of child protection advisers to such 
missions, and calls upon the Secretary-General to ensure that the need for and the 
number and roles of such advisers are systematically assessed during the preparation 
and renewal of each United Nations peacekeeping operation and political mission 
and encourages DPKO and DPA to take into account child protection when briefing 
the Council on country-specific situations;  

 25. Encourages pertinent regional and subregional organizations and 
arrangements to help address the widespread impact of armed conflict on children, 
invites them to continue the mainstreaming of child protection into their advocacy, 
policies, programmes and mission planning, the development and expansion of 
guidelines to protect children affected by armed conflict as well as the training of 
personnel and the inclusion of child protection staff in their peacekeeping and field 
operations, and reiterates its call for the establishment of child protection 



 S/2014/149
 

7/7 14-25624 
 

mechanisms within their secretariats, including through the appointment of child 
protection focal points;  

 26. Reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to continue to ensure that 
in all his reports on country-specific situations the matter of children and armed 
conflict is included as a specific aspect of the report;  

 27. Decides to remain actively seized of this matter.
