 The Security Council, 

 Noting with concern that the situation in the Middle East is tense and is likely 
to remain so, unless and until a comprehensive settlement covering all aspects of the 
Middle East problem can be reached, 

 Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations 
Disengagement Observer Force of 12 June 2013 (S/2013/345), and also reaffirming 
its resolution 1308 (2000) of 17 July 2000, 

 Stressing that both parties must abide by the terms of the 1974 Disengagement 
of Forces Agreement between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic and scrupulously 
observe the ceasefire,  

 Concurring with the Secretary-General’s findings that the ongoing military 
activities conducted by any actor in the area of separation continue to have the 
potential to escalate tensions between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic, 
jeopardize the ceasefire between the two countries, and pose a risk to the local 
civilian population and United Nations personnel on the ground, 

 Expressing grave concern at all violations of the Disengagement of Forces 
Agreement,  

 Recalling that there should be no military forces in the area of separation other 
than those of UNDOF,  

 Calling on all parties to the Syrian domestic conflict to cease military actions 
in the UNDOF area of operation, 

 Strongly condemning the incidents threatening the safety and security of 
United Nations personnel in recent months, including the detention of 21 UNDOF 
peacekeepers within the area of limitation on 6 March by armed elements of the 
Syrian opposition, the detention of four UNDOF peacekeepers within the area of 
limitation in the vicinity of Al Jamla on 7 May by armed elements of the Syrian 
opposition, and the detention of three UNTSO observers on 15 May by a group of 
anti-government armed elements, 

 Strongly condemning the recent intense fighting in the area of separation, 
including the attack which led to the injury of two UNDOF peacekeepers on 6 June, 



S/2013/376  
 

13-37657 2 
 

 Underscoring the need for UNDOF to have at its disposal all necessary means 
and resources to carry out its mandate safely and securely, 

 Expressing its profound appreciation to UNDOF’s military and civilian 
personnel, including those from Observer Group Golan, for their service and 
continued contribution, in an increasingly challenging operating environment, and 
underscoring the important contribution UNDOF’s continued presence makes to 
peace and security in the Middle East, 

 1. Calls upon the parties concerned to implement immediately its resolution 
338 (1973) of 22 October 1973;  

 2. Stresses the obligation on both parties to scrupulously and fully respect 
the terms of the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement, calls on the parties to 
exercise maximum restraint and prevent any breaches of the ceasefire and the area 
of separation, and underscores that there should be no military activity of any kind 
in the area of separation, including military operations by the Syrian Arab Armed 
Forces; 

 3. Underlines that there should be no military activity of the armed 
opposition groups in the area of separation, and urges Member States to convey 
strongly to the Syrian armed opposition groups in UNDOF’s area of operation to 
halt all activities that endanger United Nations peacekeepers on the ground and to 
accord the United Nations personnel on the ground the freedom to carry out their 
mandate safely and securely; 

 4. Calls on all parties to cooperate fully with the operations of UNDOF, to 
respect its privileges and immunities and to ensure its freedom of movement, as well 
as the security of and unhindered and immediate access for the United Nations 
personnel carrying out their mandate, including considering the temporary use of an 
alternative port of entry and departure, as required, to ensure safe and secure troop 
rotation activities, in conformity with existing agreements, and welcomes prompt 
reporting by the Secretary-General to the Security Council and troop-contributing 
countries of any actions that impede UNDOF’s ability to fulfil its mandate;  

 5. Stresses the need to enhance the safety and security of UNDOF, including 
Observer Group Golan, personnel, and endorses in this regard the Secretary-
General’s recommendation to consider further adjustments to the posture and 
operations of the Mission, as well as to implement additional mitigation measures to 
enhance the self-defence capabilities of UNDOF, including maximizing the Force 
strength and improving its self-defence equipment, within the parameters set forth in 
the Protocol to the Disengagement Agreement;  

 6. Welcomes the efforts being undertaken by the United Nations 
Disengagement Observer Force to implement the Secretary-General’s zero-tolerance 
policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and to ensure full compliance of its 
personnel with the United Nations code of conduct, requests the Secretary-General 
to continue to take all necessary action in this regard and to keep the Security 
Council informed, and urges troop-contributing countries to take preventive and 
disciplinary action to ensure that such acts are properly investigated and punished in 
cases involving their personnel; 

 7. Decides to renew the mandate of the United Nations Disengagement 
Observer Force for a period of six months, that is, until 31 December 2013, and 



 S/2013/376
 

3 13-37657 
 

requests the Secretary-General to ensure that UNDOF has the required capacity and 
resources to fulfil the mandate, as well as to enhance the Force’s ability to do so in a 
safe and secure way; 

 8. Requests the Secretary-General to report every 90 days on developments 
in the situation and the measures taken to implement resolution 338 (1973).
