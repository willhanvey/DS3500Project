of relevant international actors to combat the laundering of proceeds of criminal 
activity, corruption and illicit trafficking in narcotics and precursors in line with the 
outcome of the Moscow Conference, 

 Recalling that achieving a sustained and significant reduction in the production 
and trafficking of narcotics with a view to eliminating the narcotics industry has 
been identified as a cross-cutting priority by the “Afghanistan Compact” adopted in 
London in 2006, which provides the framework for the partnership between the 
Afghan Government and the international community, as well as the Government of 
Afghanistan’s National Drug Control Strategy, 

 Stressing the importance of a comprehensive approach to address the drug 
problem of Afghanistan, which, to be effective has to be integrated into the wider

Law and Human Rights, and Economic and Social Development, stressing that the 
development of alternative livelihood programmes is of key importance in the 
success of the efforts in counter-narcotics in Afghanistan, and reiterating that 
extensive efforts have also to be made to reduce the demand of drugs globally in 
order to contribute to the sustainability of the elimination of illicit cultivation in 
Afghanistan, 

 Expressing utmost concern at the increase of illegal smuggling, for illicit use, 
to and within Afghanistan of chemical precursors needed to produce heroin, in
