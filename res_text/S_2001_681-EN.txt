Recalling also the letters to its President from the Chargé d’affaires a.i. of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia of 5 July 2001 (S/2001/668) and from the
Chargé d’affaires a.i. of the Republic of Croatia of 9 July 2001 (S/2001/680),
concerning the disputed issue of Prevlaka,

Reaffirming once again its commitment to the independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia within its internationally recognized
borders,

Noting once again the Joint Declaration signed at Geneva on 30 September
1992 by the Presidents of the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, in particular articles 1 and 3 thereof, the latter reaffirming their
agreement concerning the demilitarization of the Prevlaka peninsula, and the
Agreement on Normalization of Relations between the Republic of Croatia and the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia of 23 August 1996 (S/1996/706, annex),

Noting with satisfaction that the overall situation in the UNMOP area of
responsibility has remained stable and calm despite continuing violations of the
demilitarization regime, including limitations placed on the free movement of
United Nations military observers,

Noting with satisfaction that the opening of crossing points between Croatia
and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the demilitarized zone continues to
facilitate civilian and commercial traffic in both directions without security
incidents and continues to represent a significant confidence-building measure in the
normalization of relations between the two parties, and urging the parties to utilize
these openings as a basis for further confidence-building measures to achieve the
normalization of relations between them,
