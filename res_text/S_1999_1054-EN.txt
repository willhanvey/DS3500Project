Canada, the Netherlands, Russian Federation, Slovenia,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland

and United States of America: draft resolution

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its previous resolutions, in particular resolutions 1189 (1998)
of 13 August 1998, 1193 (1998) of 28 August 1998 and 1214 (1998) of
8 December 1998, and the statements of its President on the situation in
Afghanistan,

Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence,
territorial integrity and national unity of Afghanistan, and its respect for
Afghanistan’s cultural and historical heritage,

Reiterating its deep concern over the continuing violations of
international humanitarian law and of human rights, particularly discrimination
against women and girls, and over the significant rise in the illicit production
of opium, and stressing that the capture by the Taliban of the Consulate-General
of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the murder of Iranian diplomats and a
journalist in Mazar-e-Sharif constituted flagrant violations of established
international law,

Recalling the relevant international counter-terrorism conventions and in
particular the obligations of parties to those conventions to extradite or
prosecute terrorists,

Strongly condemning the continuing use of Afghan territory, especially
areas controlled by the Taliban, for the sheltering and training of terrorists
and planning of terrorist acts, and reaffirming its conviction that the
suppression of international terrorism is essential for the maintenance of
international peace and security,

Deploring the fact that the Taliban continues to provide safe haven to
Usama bin Laden and to allow him and others associated with him to operate a
network of terrorist training camps from Taliban-controlled territory and to use
Afghanistan as a base from which to sponsor international terrorist operations,

Noting the indictment of Usama bin Laden and his associates by the United
States of America for, inter alia, the 7 August 1998 bombings of the United
States embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and for
conspiring to kill American nationals outside the United States, and noting also
the request of the United States of America to the Taliban to surrender them for
trial (S/1999/1021),

Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,

terrorist installations and camps, or for the preparation or organization of
terrorist acts against other States or their citizens, and cooperate with
efforts to bring indicted terrorists to justice;

and effectively brought to justice;

particular flight has been approved in advance by the Committee on the grounds
of humanitarian need, including religious obligation such as the performance of
the Hajj;

(b) Freeze funds and other financial resources, including funds derived or
generated from property owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the
