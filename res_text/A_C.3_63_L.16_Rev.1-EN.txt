 Taking note with appreciation of the attention paid to children in the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance,17 and expressing the importance of its entry into force, 

 Noting with appreciation the attention paid to children in the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,18 

 Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world 
remains critical, in an increasingly globalized environment, as a result of the 
persistence of poverty, social inequality, inadequate social and economic conditions, 
pandemics, in particular HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, environmental 
damage, natural disasters, armed conflict, foreign occupation, displacement, 
violence, terrorism, abuse, trafficking in children and their organs, all forms of 
exploitation, commercial sexual exploitation of children, child prostitution, child 
pornography and child sex tourism, neglect, illiteracy, hunger, intolerance, 
discrimination, racism, xenophobia, gender inequality, disability and inadequate 
legal protection, and convinced that urgent and effective national and international 
action is called for, 

 Reiterating that eradicating poverty is the greatest global challenge facing the 
world today and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, in 
particular for developing countries, and recognizing that chronic poverty remains 
the single biggest obstacle to meeting the needs of and promoting and protecting the 
rights of children, and that urgent national and international action is therefore 
required to eliminate it, 

 Reaffirming that democracy, development, peace and security, and the full and 
effective enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms are 
interdependent and mutually reinforcing and contribute to the eradication of extreme 
poverty, 

 Reaffirming also the need for mainstreaming a gender perspective in all 
policies and programmes relating to children, and recognizing the child as a rights 
holder in all policies and programmes relating to children, 

 Bearing in mind that the year 2009 marks the twentieth anniversary of the 
adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the fiftieth anniversary of 
the Declaration of the Rights of the Child,19 which provided a foundation for the 
Convention, and considering that these anniversaries are suitable occasions for 
strengthening the efforts of Member States to promote the rights of the child, 
 

  I

Convention on the Rights of the Child1 and the Optional Protocols thereto2 as a

cooperate closely with all those organs and mechanisms, in particular the special 
rapporteurs and special representatives of the United Nations system; 

 8. Encourages States to strengthen their national statistical capacities and to 
use statistics disaggregated, inter alia, by age, gender and other relevant factors that

programmes so that economic and social resources are used efficiently and 
effectively for the full realization of the rights of the child;

and community-based care should be promoted over placement in institutions, and

the Human Rights Council;
