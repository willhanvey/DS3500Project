The General Assembly,

nuclear explosions constitutes an effective nuclear disarmament and non-
proliferation measure,

Recalling that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, adopted by its
resolution 50/245 of 10 September 1996, was opened for signature on 24 September
1996,

Stressing that a universal and effectively verifiable Comprehensive Nuclear-
Test-Ban Treaty constitutes a fundamental instrument in the field of disarmament
and nuclear non-proliferation,

Encouraged by the signing of the Treaty by one hundred and sixty-six States,
including forty-one of the forty-four needed for its entry into force, and welcoming
the ratification of ninety-six States, including thirty-one of the forty-four needed for
its entry into force, among which there are three nuclear-weapon States,

Recalling its resolution 55/41 of 20 November 2000,

Welcoming the Final Declaration of the Conference on Measures to Facilitate
the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, held in
