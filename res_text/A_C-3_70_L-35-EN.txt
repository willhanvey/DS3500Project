A/C.3/70/L.35 
 

 

15-19033 4/9 

 

 Underlining the efforts of the Secretary-General to contribute to improving 

inter-Korean relations and promoting reconciliation and stability on the Korean 

peninsula and the well-being of the Korean people, 

 1. Condemns the long-standing and ongoing systematic, widespread and 

gross violations of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, 

including those which the commission of inquiry on human rights in the Democratic 

People’s Republic of Korea, established by the Human Rights Council in its 

resolution 22/13 of 21 March 2013,
11

 has said may amount to crimes against 

humanity, and the continuing impunity for such violations;  

 2. Expresses its very serious concern at: 

 (a) The persistence of continuing reports of violations of human rights, 

including the detailed findings made by the commission of inquiry in its report,
2
 

such as: 

 (i) Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 

including inhuman conditions of detention; rape; public executions; 

extrajudicial and arbitrary detention; the absence of due process and the rule of 

law, including fair trial guarantees and an independent judiciary; extrajudicial, 

summary and arbitrary executions; the imposition of the death penalty for 

political and religious reasons; collective punishments extending up to three 

generations; and the extensive use of forced labour;  

 (ii) The existence of an extensive system of political prison camps, where a 

vast number of persons are deprived of their liberty and subjected to 

deplorable conditions and where alarming violations of human rights are 

perpetrated; 

 (iii) The forcible transfer of populations and the limitations imposed on every 

person who wishes to move freely within the country and travel abroad, 

including the punishment of those who leave or try to leave the country 

without permission, or their families, as well as punishment of persons who 

are returned; 

 (iv) The situation of refugees and asylum seekers expelled from or returned 

to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and sanctions imposed on 

citizens of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea who have been 

repatriated from abroad, leading to punishments of internment, torture, other 

cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, sexual violence or the death penalty, 

and in this regard strongly urges all States to respect the fundamental principle 

of non-refoulement, to treat those who seek refuge humanely and to ensure 

unhindered access to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and 

his Office, with a view to protecting the human rights of those who seek 

refuge, and once again urges States parties to comply with their obligations 

under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees
12

 and the 1967 

Protocol thereto
13

 in relation to refugees from the Democratic People’s 

Republic of Korea who are covered by those instruments;

and the right of everyone to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly 

or through freely chosen representatives, of his or her country;  

 (vi) Violations of economic, social and cultural rights, which have led to 

severe hunger, malnutrition, widespread health problems and other hardship 

for the population in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, in particular 

for women, children, persons with disabilities and the elderly;  

 (vii) Violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women, in 

particular the creation of internal conditions that force women to leave the 

country and make them extremely vulnerable to trafficking in persons for the 

purpose of prostitution, domestic servitude or forced marriage and the 

subjection of women to gender-based discrimination, including in the political 

and social spheres, forced abortions and other forms of sexual and gender -

based violence; 

 (viii) Violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of children, in 

particular the continued lack of access to basic economic, social and cultural 

rights for many children, and in this regard notes the particularly vulnerable 

situation faced by, inter alia, returned or repatriated children, street children, 

children with disabilities, children whose parents are detained, chi ldren living 

in detention or in institutions and children in conflict with the law;  

 (ix) Violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons 

with disabilities, especially violations involving the use of collective camps 

and coercive measures that target the rights of persons with disabilities to 

decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children and 

those involving medical testing, forced relocation to rural areas and separation 

of children with disabilities from their parents; 

 (x) Violations of workers’ rights, including the right to freedom of 

association and effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, the 

right to strike as defined by the obligations of the Democratic People ’s 

Republic of Korea under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 

Cultural Rights,
5 

and the prohibition of the economic exploitation of children 

and of any harmful or hazardous work of children as defined by the 

obligations of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea under the 

Convention on the Rights of the Child;
6
 

 (xi) Discrimination based on the songbun system, which classifies people on 

the basis of State-assigned social class and birth, and also includes 

consideration of political opinions and religion;  

 (b) The continued refusal of the Government of the Democratic People ’s 

Republic of Korea to extend an invitation to the Special Rapporteur of the Human 

Rights Council on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People ’s 

Republic of Korea or to extend cooperation to the Special Rapporteur and other 

United Nations special procedures in accordance with their terms of reference, as 

well as to other United Nations human rights mechanisms;  



A/C.3/70/L.35 
 

 

15-19033 6/9 

 

 (c) The continued lack of acknowledgement by the Government of the 

Democratic People’s Republic of Korea of the grave human rights situation in the 

country and its consequential lack of action to implement the recommendations 

contained in the outcome of its first universal periodic review
14

 and to give 

consideration to the concluding observations of the treaty bodies;  

 3. Underscores its very serious concern at the systematic abduction, denial 

of repatriation and subsequent enforced disappearance of persons, including those 

from other countries, on a large scale and as a matter of State policy, and in this 

regard strongly calls upon the Government of the Democratic People ’s Republic of 

Korea urgently to resolve these issues of international concern, in a transparent 

manner, including by ensuring the immediate return of abductees;  

 4. Expresses its very deep concern at the precarious humanitarian situation 

in the country, which could rapidly deteriorate owing to limited resilience to natural 

disasters and to government policies causing limitations in the availability of and 

access to adequate food, compounded by structural weaknesses in agricultural 

production resulting in significant shortages of diversified food and the State 

restrictions on the cultivation of and trade in foodstuffs, as well as the prevalence of 

chronic malnutrition, particularly among the most vulnerable groups, pregnant and 

lactating women, children, persons with disabilities, the elderly and political 

prisoners, and urges the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, 

in this regard, to take preventive and remedial action, cooperating where necessary 

with international donor agencies and in accordance with international standards for 

monitoring humanitarian assistance;  

 5. Commends the Special Rapporteur for the activities undertaken so far 

and for his continued efforts in the conduct of his mandate despite the denial of 

access; 

 6.  Welcomes the findings contained in the report of the Special Rapporteur,
3
 

and takes note of his recommendations, in particular those aimed at exploring 

possible options to ensure justice and accountability;  

 7. Recalls its appreciation for the work of the commission of inquiry, 

recognizes the continuing importance of its report, and regrets that the commission 

received no cooperation from the authorities of the Democratic  People’s Republic of 

Korea, including with regard to access to the country;  

 8. Acknowledges the commission’s finding that the body of testimony 

gathered and the information received provide reasonable grounds to believe that 

crimes against humanity have been committed in the Democratic People’s Republic 

of Korea, pursuant to policies established at the highest level of the State for 

decades; 

 9. Expresses its concern at the failure of the authorities of the Democratic 

People’s Republic of Korea to prosecute those responsible for human rights 

violations, including violations which the commission of inquiry has said may 

amount to crimes against humanity, and encourages the international community to 

cooperate with accountability efforts and to ensure that such crimes do not remain 

unpunished;

Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, to ensure accountability, to provide the 

Special Rapporteur with increased support, to enhance the engagement and 

capacity-building of the Governments of all States concerned, civil society and 

other stakeholders and to maintain the visibility of the situation of human rights in

that it has sufficient resources and support to fulfil its mandate and that it is not
