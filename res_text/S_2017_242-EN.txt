context can fuel and exacerbate conflict and hamper post-conflict national 

reconciliation, thereby undermining the security, stability, governance, social, 

economic and cultural development of affected States,  

 Noting with grave concern the involvement of non-state actors, notably 

terrorist groups, in the destruction of cultural heritage and the trafficking in cultural 

property and related offences, in particular at the continued threat posed to 

international peace and security by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, 

also known as Da’esh), Al-Qaida and associated individuals, groups, undertakings 

and entities, and reaffirming its resolve to address all aspects of that threat,  

 Also noting with concern that the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, 

also known as Da’esh), Al-Qaida and associated individuals, groups, undertakings 

and entities are generating income from engaging directly or indirectly in the illegal 

excavation and in the looting and smuggling of cultural property from 

archaeological sites, museums, libraries, archives, and other sites, which is being 

used to support their recruitment efforts and to strengthen their operational 

capability to organize and carry out terrorist attacks,  

 Noting with grave concern the serious threat posed to cultural heritage by 

landmines and unexploded ordnance,  

 Strongly concerned about the links between the activities of terrorists and 

organized criminal groups that, in some cases, facilitate criminal activities, 

including trafficking in cultural property, illegal revenues and financial flows as 

well as money-laundering, bribery and corruption,  

 Recalling Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) which requires that all 

States shall prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts and refrain from 

providing any form of support, active or passive, to individuals, groups, 

undertakings or entities involved in such acts, and other resolutions that emphasize 

the need for Member States to continue exercising vigilance over relevant financial 

transactions and improve information-sharing capabilities and practices, in line with 

applicable international law, within and between governments through relevant 

authorities,  

 Recognizing the indispensable role of international cooperation in crime 

prevention and criminal justice responses to counter trafficking in cultural property 

and related offences in a comprehensive and effective manner, stressing that the 

development and maintenance of fair and effective criminal justice sys tems should 

be a part of any strategy to counter terrorism and transnational organized crime and 

recalling in this respect the provisions of the United Nations Convention against 

Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto,  

 Recalling the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event 

of Armed Conflict of 14 May 1954 and its Protocols of 14 May 1954 and 26 March 

1999, the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, 

Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property of 14 November 1970, the 

Convention concerning the protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage of

trafficking in cultural property,  

 Commending the efforts undertaken by Member States in order to protect and 

safeguard cultural heritage in the context of armed conflicts and taking note of the 

Declaration issued by Ministers of Culture participating in the International 

Conference “Culture as an Instrument of Dialogue among Peoples”, held in Milan 

on 31 July-1 August 2015 as well as the International Conference on the victims of 

ethnic and religious violence in the Middle East, held in Paris on 8 September 2015, 

and the Conference on Safeguarding Endangered Cultural Heritage held in Abu 

Dhabi on 3 December 2016 and its declaration,  

 Welcoming the central role played by UNESCO in protecting cultural heritage 

and promoting culture as an instrument to bring people closer together and foster 

dialogue, including through the #Unite4Heritage campaign, and the central role of 

the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and INTERPOL in 

preventing and countering all forms and aspects of trafficking in cultural property 

and related offences, including through fostering broad law enforcement and 

judicial cooperation, and in raising awareness on such trafficking,

Team of 1267/1989/2253 ISIL (Da’esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee, in 

identifying and raising awareness on the challenges related to the illicit trade of 

cultural property as it relates to the financing of terrorism pursuant to resolutions 

2199 (2015) and 2253 (2015), and welcoming the Financial Action Task Force 

(FATF) guidance on recommendation 5 on the criminalization of terrorist financing 

for any purpose, in line with these resolutions,  

 Expressing in this regard concern at the continuing use in a globalized society, 

by terrorists and their supporters, of new information and communications 

technologies, in particular the Internet, to facilitate terrorist acts, and condemning 

their use to fund terrorist acts through the illicit trade in cultural property,  

 Underlining the importance that all relevant United Nations entities coordinate 

their efforts while implementing their respective mandates,  

 Noting the recent decision by the International Criminal Court, which for the 

first time convicted a defendant for the war crimes of intentionally directing attacks 

against religious buildings and historic monuments and buildings,  

 1. Deplores and condemns the unlawful destruction of cultural heritage, 

inter alia, destruction of religious sites and artefacts, as well as the looting and 

smuggling of cultural property from archaeological sites, museums, libraries, 

archives, and other sites, in the context of armed conflicts, notably by terrorist 

groups; 

 2. Recalls its condemnation of any engagement in direct or indirect trade 

involving ISIL, Al-Nusra Front (ANF) and all other individuals, groups, 

undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, and reiterates that such 

engagement could constitute financial support for entities designated by the 

1267/1989/2253 ISIL (Da’esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee and may lead to 

further listings by the Committee;

associated individuals, groups, undertakings and entities;  

 4. Affirms that directing unlawful attacks against sites and buildings 

dedicated to religion, education, art, science or charitable purposes, or  historic 

monuments may constitute, under certain circumstances and pursuant to 

international law a war crime and that perpetrators of such attacks must be brought 

to justice;  

 5. Stresses that Member States have the primary responsibility in protecting 

their cultural heritage and that efforts to protect cultural heritage in the context of 

armed conflicts should be in conformity with the Charter, including its purposes and 

principles, and international law, and should respect the sovereignty of all States;   

 6. Invites, in this regard, the United Nations and all other relevant 

organizations to continue providing Member States, upon their request and based on 

their identified needs, with all necessary assistance;  

 7. Encourages all Member States that have not yet done so to consider 

ratifying the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of 

Armed Conflict of 14 May 1954 and its Protocols, as well as other relevant 

international conventions; 

 8. Requests Member States to take appropriate steps to prevent and counter 

the illicit trade and trafficking in cultural property and other items of

including by prohibiting cross-border trade in such illicit items where States have a 

reasonable suspicion that the items originate from a context of armed conflict, 

notably from terrorist groups, and which lack clear ly documented and certified 

provenance, thereby allowing for their eventual safe return, in particular items 

illegally removed from Iraq since 6 August 1990 and from Syria since 15 March 

2011, and recalls in this regard that States shall ensure that no funds, other financial 

assets or other economic resources are made available, directly or indirectly, by

individuals, groups, entities or undertakings associated with ISIL or Al -Qaida in 

accordance with relevant resolutions;
