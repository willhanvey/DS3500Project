population and the civilian population in the occupied Syrian Golan that are 

contrary to international law, 

 Bearing in mind the extremely detrimental impact of Israeli settlement 

policies, decisions and activities on the efforts to resume and advance the peace 

process, on the credibility of the peace process and on the prospects for the 

achievement of peace in the Middle East in accordance with the two-State solution 

of Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security within recognized 

borders, on the basis of the pre-1967 borders, 

 Expressing grave concern about the continuation by Israel, the occupying 

Power, of settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 

Jerusalem, in violation of international humanitarian law, relevant United Nations 

resolutions, the agreements reached between the parties and obligations under the 

Quartet road map, and in defiance of the calls by the international community to 

cease all settlement activities, 

 Expressing grave concern in particular about Israel’s construction and 

expansion of settlements in and around occupied East Jerusalem, including its 

so-called E-1 plan that aims to connect its illegal settlements around and further 

isolate occupied East Jerusalem, the continuing demolition of Palestinian homes and 

eviction of Palestinian families from the city, the revocation of Palestinian residency 

rights in the city, and ongoing settlement activities in the Jordan Valley,  

 Expressing grave concern about the continuing unlawful construction by Israel 

of the wall inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East 

Jerusalem, and expressing its concern in particular about the route of the wall in 

departure from the Armistice Line of 1949, which is causing humanitarian hardship 

and a serious decline of socioeconomic conditions for the Palestinian people, is 

fragmenting the territorial contiguity of the Territory and undermining its viability, 

and could prejudge future negotiations and make the two-State solution physically 

impossible to implement, 

 Deeply concerned that the wall’s route has been traced in such a way as to 

include the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian 

Territory, including East Jerusalem, 

 Deploring settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 

East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan and any activities involving the 

confiscation of land, the disruption of the livelihood of protected persons, the forced 

transfer of civilians and the de facto annexation of land,  

 Recalling the need to end all acts of violence, including acts of terror, 

provocation, incitement and destruction, 

 Gravely concerned about the rising incidents of violence, destruction, 

harassment, provocation and incitement by extremist Israeli settlers in the Occupied 

Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, against Palestinian civilians, 

including children, and their properties, including historic and religious sites, and 

agricultural lands, 

 Taking note of the relevant reports of the Secretary-General,10
