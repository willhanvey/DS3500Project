aspects of their lives, and in that context noting that the promotion and protection of 

human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels should

progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective 

development policies at the national level, as well as equitable economic relations 

and a favourable economic environment at the international level,  

 Recognizing further that poverty is an affront to human dignity,  

 Recognizing that extreme poverty and hunger are among the greatest global 

threats and require the collective commitment of the international community for their 

eradication, pursuant to Millennium Development Goal 1 and Sustainable Development 

Goals 1 and 2, and therefore calling upon the international community, including the 

Human Rights Council, to contribute towards achieving that goal,  

 Recognizing also that historical injustices, inter alia, have contributed to the 

poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion, economic disparity, 

instability and insecurity that affect many people in different parts of the world, in 

particular in developing countries, 

 Recognizing further that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, 

including extreme poverty, is one of the critical elements in the promotion and 

realization of the right to development and is the greatest global challenge and an 

indispensable requirement for sustainable development, which requires a 

multifaceted and integrated approach, and committed to achieving sustainable 

development in its three dimensions – economic, social and environmental – in a 

balanced and integrated manner,

respective mandates, including the specialized agencies, funds and programmes of 

the United Nations system, relevant international organizations, including the World 

Trade Organization, and relevant stakeholders, including civil society organizations, 

to give due consideration to the right to development in the implementation of the 

2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to cooperate with the United Nations 

High Commissioner for Human Rights in the fulfilment of her mandate with regard 

to the implementation of the right to development,  

 1. Takes note of the consolidated report of the Secretary-General and the 

United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights concerning the promotion and 

realization of the right to development;14  

 2. Acknowledges the need to strive for greater acceptance, operationalization 

and realization of the right to development at the international level while urging all 

States to undertake at the national level the necessary policy formulation and to 

institute the measures required for the implementation of the right to development as 

an integral part of all human rights and fundamental freedoms;  

 3. Emphasizes the relevant provisions of General Assembly resolution 

60/251 of 15 March 2006 establishing the Human Rights Council, and in this regard 

calls upon the Council to implement the agreement to continue to act to ensure that 

its agenda promotes and advances sustainable development, including the 2030 

Agenda for Sustainable Development,5 which seeks to build on the Millennium 

Development Goals and complete what they did not achieve, and also in this regard 

to lead the raising of the right to development, as set out in paragraphs 5 and 10 of

the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action,3 to the same level as and on a par 

with all other human rights and fundamental freedoms;  

 4. Supports the realization of the mandate of the Working Group on the Right 

to Development, 15  and recognizes the need for renewed efforts with a view to  

overcoming the existing political impasse within the Working Group and to fulfil at 

the earliest its mandate as established by the Commission on Human Rights in its 

resolution 1998/7211 and the Human Rights Council in its resolution 4/4 of 30 March 

2007;16  

 5. Stresses the importance of the core principles contained in the conclusions 

of the Working Group at its third session17 that are congruent with the purpose of 

international human rights instruments, such as equality, non-discrimination, 

accountability, participation and international cooperation, as critical to mainstreaming 

the right to development at the national and international levels, and underlines the 

importance of the principles of equity and transparency;  

 6. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Chair-Rapporteur of the 

Working Group on the Right to Development on its twentieth session; 18  

 7. Notes the presentation to the Working Group at its nineteenth session of 

the set of standards for the implementation of the right to develop ment prepared by 

the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group, 19  which is a useful basis for further 

deliberations on the implementation and realization of the right to development;  

 8. Calls upon Member States to contribute to the efforts of the Working 

Group, including, inter alia, on the elaboration of a draft legally binding instrument 

on the right to development on the basis of the draft prepared by the Chair-Rapporteur, 

as decided by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 42/23 of 27 September 

2019;20  

 9. Stresses that it is important that the Chair-Rapporteur and the Working 

Group, in the discharge of their mandates, take into account the need:  

 (a) To promote the democratization of the system of international governance 

in order to increase the effective participation of developing countries in international 

decision-making; 

 (b) To also promote effective partnerships such as the New Partnership for 

Africa’s Development13 and other similar initiatives with the developing countries, 

particularly the least developed countries, for the purpose of the realization of their 

right to development, including the achievement of the Sustainable Development 

Goals; 

 (c) To strive for greater acceptance, operationalization and realization of the 

right to development at the international level, while urging all States to undertake at 

the national level the necessary policy formulation and to institute the measures 

required for the implementation of the right to development as an integral part of all 

human rights and fundamental freedoms, and also while urging all States to expand

cooperation for the realization of the right to development, bearing in mind that 

lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires 

effective development policies at the national level and a favourable economic 

environment at the international level;  

 (d) To consider ways and means to continue to ensure the operationalization 

of the right to development as a priority;  

 (e) To mainstream the right to development in the policies and operational 

activities of the specialized agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations 

system, as well as in the policies and strategies of the international financial and 

multilateral trading systems, bearing in mind in this regard that the core principles of 

the international economic, commercial and financial spheres, such as equity, 

non-discrimination, transparency, accountability, participation and international 

cooperation, including effective partnerships for development, are indispensable  in 

achieving the right to development and preventing discriminatory treatment arising 

from political or other non-economic considerations in addressing the issues of 

concern to the developing countries;  

 10. Encourages the Human Rights Council to continue to consider how to 

ensure follow-up to the work of the former Subcommission on the Promotion and 

Protection of Human Rights on the right to development, in accordance with the 

relevant provisions of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the 

Commission on Human Rights and in compliance with decisions to be taken by the 

Council; 

 11. Takes note with appreciation of the decision of the Human Rights Council 

in its resolution 42/23 to establish a subsidiary expert mechanism to provide the 

Council with thematic expertise on the right to development in searching for, 

identifying and sharing best practices among Member States and to promote the 

implementation of the right to development worldwide;  

 12. Also takes note with appreciation  of the report of the Special Rapporteur 

of the Human Rights Council on the right to development, 21 in which the Special 

Rapporteur explores the explicit link between the right to development and disaster 

risk reduction and its practical implications; 

 13. Stresses that South-South cooperation is not a substitute for, but rather a 

complement to, North-South cooperation and hence should not result in a reduction 

of North-South cooperation or hamper progress in fulfilling existing official 

development assistance commitments, and encourages Member States and other 

relevant stakeholders to incorporate the right to development into the design, 

financing and implementation of cooperation processes;  

 14. Urges Member States, the Office of the United Nations High 

Commissioner for Human Rights and other relevant specialized agencies, funds and 

programmes of the United Nations system to provide the Special Rapporteur on the 

right to development with all the assistance and support necessary for the fulfilment 

of his mandate;  

 15. Reaffirms the commitment to implement the goals and targets set out in all 

the outcome documents of the major United Nations conferences and summits and 

their review processes, in particular those relating to the realization of the right to 

development, recognizing that the realization of the right to development is critical 

to achieving the objectives, goals and targets set out in those outcome documents;

 16. Also reaffirms that the realization of the right to development is essential 

to the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which 

regards all human rights as universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, 

places the human person at the centre of development and recognizes that, while 

development facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights, a lack of development may 

not be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally recognized human rights;  

 17. Further reaffirms that development contributes significantly to the 

enjoyment of all human rights by all, and calls upon all countries to realize people -

centred development of the people, by the people and for the people;  

 18. Calls upon all States to spare no effort in promoting the right to 

development, in particular while implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

Development, as it is conducive to the overall enjoyment of human rights;  

 19. Stresses that the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection 

of all human rights lies with the State, and reaffirms that States have the primary 

responsibility for their own economic and social development and that the role of 

national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized;  

 20. Reaffirms the primary responsibility of States to create national and 

international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to development, as 

well as their commitment to cooperate with one another to that end;  

 21. Expresses concern about the increasing cases of human rights violations 

and abuses by some transnational corporations and other business enterprises, 

underlines the need to ensure that appropriate protection, justice and remedies are 

provided to the victims of human rights violations and abuses resulting from their 

activities, and underscores the fact that these entities must contribute to the means of 

implementation for the realization of the right to development;  

 22. Reaffirms the need for an international environment that is conducive to 

the realization of the right to development;  

 23. Emphasizes the critical importance of identifying and analysing obstacles 

impeding the full realization of the right to development at both the national and 

international levels; 

 24. Reaffirms that, while globalization offers both opportunities and 

challenges, the process of globalization remains deficient in achieving the objectives 

of integrating all countries into a globalized world, stresses the need for policies and 

measures at the national and global levels to respond to the challenges and 

opportunities of globalization if this process is to be made fully inclusive and 

equitable, recognizes that globalization has brought disparities between and within 

countries and that issues such as trade and trade liberalization, the transfer of 

technology, infrastructure development and market access should be managed 

effectively in order to mitigate the challenges of poverty and underdevelopment and 

to make the right to development a reality for everyone;  

 25. Recognizes that, despite continuous efforts on the part of the international 

community, the gap between developed and developing countries remains 

unacceptably wide, that most of the developing countries continue to face difficulties 

in participating in the globalization process and that many risk being marginal ized 

and effectively excluded from its benefits;  

 26. Expresses its deep concern, in this regard, about the negative impact on 

the realization of the right to development owing to the further aggravation of the 

economic and social situation, in particular of developing countries, as a result of the 

effects of international energy, food and financial crises, as well as the increasing 

challenges posed by global climate change and the loss of biodiversity, which have 



A/C.3/74/L.40/Rev.1
