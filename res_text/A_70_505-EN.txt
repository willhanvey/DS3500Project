development of Tokelau by New Zealand and the specialized agencies and other 

organizations of the United Nations system, in particular the United Nations 

Development Programme, 

 Noting that, as a small island Territory, Tokelau exemplifies the situation of 

most remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories and that, as a case study pointing to 

successful cooperation for decolonization, Tokelau has wider significance for the 

United Nations as it seeks to complete its work in decolonization,  

 Recalling the status of Tokelau as an associate member of the Food and 

Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,

decision in August 2005 to hold in February 2006 a referendum on self -

determination on the basis of a draft constitution for Tokelau and a draft treaty of 

free association with New Zealand, and its subsequent decision to hold a further 

referendum in October 2007, and bearing in mind also that the two referendums did 

not produce the two-thirds majority of valid votes cast required by the General Fono 

to change the status of Tokelau from that of a Non-Self-Governing Territory under 

the administration of New Zealand,  

 Recalling the holding of free and fair elections in the Territory in January

 Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territories 

are valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the 

peoples concerned and in conformity with the clearly defined principles contained 

in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of

 Noting the stated position of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great 

Britain and Northern Ireland and the stated position of the Government of the 

United States of America on the Non-Self-Governing Territories under their 

administration, 

 Noting also the constitutional developments in some Non-Self-Governing 

Territories affecting the internal structure of governance about which the Special 

Committee has received information,  

 Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories 

should continue to guide the development of their future political status and that 

referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an 

important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  

 Convinced also that any negotiations to determine the status of a Territory 

must take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of that 

Territory, under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case -by-case basis, and that 

the views of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories in respect of their 

right to self-determination should be ascertained,  

 Noting that a number of Non-Self-Governing Territories have expressed 

concern at the procedure followed by some administering Powers, contrary to the 

wishes of the Territories themselves, of amending or enacting legislation for 

application to the Territories, either through orders in council, in order to apply to 

the Territories the international treaty obligations of the administering Power, or 

through the unilateral application of laws and regulations,  

 Aware of the importance of the international financial services and tourism 

sectors for the economies of some of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, 

 Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the 

local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional 

organizations, 

 Mindful that United Nations visiting and special missions provide an effective 

means of ascertaining the situation in the Territories, that some Territories have not 

received a United Nations visiting mission for a long time and that no visiting 

missions have been sent to some of the Territories, and considering the possibility of 

sending further visiting missions to the Territories at an appropriate time, in 

consultation with the relevant administering Powers and in accordance with the 

relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations on decolonization,  

 Mindful also that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its 

understanding of the political status of the peoples of the Territories and to fulfil its 

mandate effectively, it is important for it to be apprised by the relevant 

administering Powers and to receive information from other appropriate sources, 

including the representatives of the Territories, concerning the wishes and 

aspirations of the peoples of the Territories,  

 Acknowledging the regular transmission by the administering Powers to the 

Secretary-General of information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter,

work of the Committee,

15-20186 22/44 

 

 Recognizing the need for the Special Committee to ensure that the appropriate 

bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at 

assisting the peoples of the Territories in gaining a better understanding of the 

options for self-determination, 

 Mindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the 

Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of 

representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for 

the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the 

seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial 

element in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political 

status of the Territories, 

 Noting the stated positions of the representatives of the Non-Self-Governing 

Territories before the Special Committee and at its regional seminars,  

 Welcoming the Caribbean regional seminar held by the Special Committee in 

Managua and hosted by the Government of Nicaragua from 19 to 21 May 2015 as a 

significant and forward-looking event, which enabled the participants to assess the 

progress made in the decolonization process and to review the existing working 

methods of the Committee and renew its momentum in implementing its historic 

task, 

 Recognizing the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted 

by the seminar, which are annexed to the report of the Special Committee
4
 and 

which outline the findings of the seminar, including, especially, the way forward for 

the decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General 

Assembly of the period 2011-2020 as the Third International Decade for the 

Eradication of Colonialism,
5
 

 Conscious of the particular vulnerability of the Territories to natural disasters 

and environmental degradation, and in that connection bearing in mind the 

applicability to the Territories of the programmes of action or outcome documents 

of all United Nations world conferences and special sessions of the General 

Assembly in the economic and social spheres,  

 Noting with appreciation the contribution to the development of some 

Territories by the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations 

system, in particular the Economic Commission for Latin America and the 

Caribbean, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the 

United Nations Development Programme and the World Food Programme, as well 

as regional institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean 

Community, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, the Pacific Islands 

Forum and the agencies of the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific,  

 Recalling the statement made by the representative of the Economic 

Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean at the 2015 Caribbean regional 

seminar that all seven Caribbean Non-Self-Governing Territories were active 

associate members of the Commission,

administering Powers, in cooperation with the territorial Governments and 

appropriate bodies of the United Nations system, to develop political education 

programmes for the Territories in order to foster an awareness among the people of

Colonialism, and calls upon the administering Powers, in accordance with those 

resolutions, to take all steps necessary to enable the peoples of the Non -Self-
