Human Rights Council on the subject, and emphasizing the importance of their full 

and effective implementation,  

 Recognizing the positive role that regional human rights systems can play in the 

global protection against arbitrary deprivation of life,  

 Acknowledging the importance of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

Development 5  and its implementation for the promotion and protection of the 

enjoyment by all persons of human rights, gender equality, access to justice for all 

and effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels,  

 Noting with deep concern that impunity continues to be a major cause of the 

perpetuation of violations of human rights, including extrajudicial, summary or 

arbitrary executions, especially with regard to the gender-related killing of women 

and girls, also known as femicide,  

 Noting that enforced disappearances can end in extrajudicial, summary or 

arbitrary executions, recalling the importance in this regard of the International 

Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, 6  and 

calling upon all States which have not yet done so to consider signing and ratifying 

or acceding to the Convention,  

 Acknowledging that international human rights law and international 

humanitarian law are complementary and mutually reinforcing,  

 Noting with deep concern the growing number of civilians and persons hors de 

combat killed in situations of armed conflict and internal strife, and that women and 

girls are disproportionately affected by conflict, as recognized in Security Council 

resolution 1325 (2000) of 31 October 2000 on women and peace and security and 

subsequent resolutions on the matter,  

 Noting with deep concern also the continuing instances of the arbitrary 

deprivation of life, resulting from, inter alia, the imposition and implementation of 

capital punishment when carried out in a manner that violates international law,  

 Recalling the United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and 

Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders (the Bangkok Rules)7 and the adoption 

of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the 

Nelson Mandela Rules),8  

 Deeply concerned about acts that can amount to extrajudicial, summary or 

arbitrary executions committed against persons exercising their rights to peaceful 

assembly and freedom of expression in all regions of the world,  

 Deeply concerned also about killings committed by non-State actors, including 

terrorist groups and criminal organizations, which may amount to abuses of 

international human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law,  

 Acknowledging that extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions may under 

certain circumstances amount to genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes, as 

defined in international law, including in the Rome Statute of the International 

Criminal Court, 9  and recalling in this regard that each individual State has the 

responsibility to protect its populations from such crimes, as set out by the General

Assembly in its resolutions 60/1 of 16 September 2005 and 63/308 of 14 September 

2009,  

 Convinced of the need for effective action to prevent, combat and eliminate the 

abhorrent practice of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, which represent 

flagrant violations of international human rights law, particularly the right to life, as 

well as of international humanitarian law,  

 1. Reiterates its strong condemnation of all the extrajudicial, summary or 

arbitrary executions that continue to occur throughout the world;  

 2. Demands that all States ensure that the practice of extrajudicial, summary 

or arbitrary executions is brought to an end and that they take effective action to 

prevent, combat and eliminate the phenomenon in all its forms and manifestations;  

 3. Reiterates that all States must conduct prompt, exhaustive and impartial 

investigations, exercising due diligence, into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, 

summary or arbitrary executions, identify and bring to justice those responsible, while 

ensuring the right of every person to a fair hearing by a competent, independent and 

impartial tribunal established by law, grant adequate compensation within a 

reasonable time to the victims or their families and adopt all measures, including legal 

and judicial measures, also bearing in mind gender equality in access to justice, 

necessary to put an end to impunity, particularly with regard to the gender-related 

killing of women and girls, also known as femicide, and extrajudicial, summary or 

arbitrary executions of refugees and migrants and humanitarian workers, and prevent 

the further occurrence of such executions, as recommended in the Principles on the 

Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extralegal, Arbitrary and Summary 

Executions,10 fully consistent with their obligations under international law;  

 4. Calls upon Governments, and invites intergovernmental and 

non-governmental organizations, to pay greater attention to the work of national-level 

commissions of inquiry into extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, with a 

view to ensuring the effective contribution of these commissions to accountability 

and to combating impunity;  

 5. Calls upon all States, in order to prevent extrajudicial, summary or 

arbitrary executions, to comply with their obligations under the relevant provisions 

of international human rights instruments, and also calls upon States which retain the 

death penalty to pay particular regard to the provisions contained in articles 6, 14 

and 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights2 and articles 37 

and 40 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 11 bearing in mind the safeguards 

and guarantees set out in Economic and Social Council resolutions 1984/50 of 25 May 

1984 and 1989/64 of 24 May 1989 and taking into account the recommendations of 

the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on extrajudicial, summary or 

arbitrary executions in reports to the Council and the General Assembly, including 

the report submitted to the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session,12 regarding the need 

to respect all safeguards and restrictions, including limitation to the most serious 

crimes, stringent respect of due process and fair trial safeguards and the right to seek 

pardon or commutation of sentence;  

 6. Emphasizes that to prevent extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 

States should take necessary steps to adopt such laws or other measures as may be 

necessary to give effect to the right to life in accordance with international law and 

that everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law;

 7. Urges all States:  

 (a) To take all measures required by international human rights law and 

international humanitarian law to prevent loss of life, in particular that of children, 

during detention, arrest, public demonstrations, internal and communal violence, civil 

unrest, public emergencies or armed conflicts and to ensure that the police, law 

enforcement agents, armed forces and other agents acting on behalf of or with the 

consent or acquiescence of the State, including private security providers, act with 

restraint and in conformity with international human rights law and international 

humanitarian law, including the principles of proportionality and necessity, and in this 

regard to ensure that police and law enforcement officials are guided by the Code of 

Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials13 and the Basic Principles on the Use of Force 

and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials;14  

 (b) To ensure the effective protection of the right to life of all persons, to 

conduct, when required by obligations under international law, prompt, exhaustive 

and impartial investigations into all killings, including those targeted at specific 

groups of persons, such as racially motivated violence leading to the death of the 

victim, killings of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic 

minorities or because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, killings of persons 

affected by terrorism or hostage-taking or living under foreign occupation, killings of 

refugees, internally displaced persons, migrants, street children or members of 

indigenous communities, killings of persons for reasons related to their activities as 

human rights defenders, lawyers, journalists or demonstrators, killings committed in 

the name of passion or in the name of honour and killings committed for 

discriminatory reasons on any basis, to bring those responsible to just ice before a 

competent, independent and impartial judiciary at the national or, where appropriate, 

international level and to ensure that such killings, including those committed by 

security forces, police and law enforcement agents, paramilitary groups or  private 

forces, are neither condoned nor sanctioned by State officials or personnel;

the United Nations and of regional human rights systems, to review, where necessary, 

their domestic laws and practices with regard to the use of force in law enforcement 

in order to ensure that these laws and practices are in conformity with their 

international obligations and commitments;  

 10. Also encourages States to make appropriate protective equipment and less 

lethal weapons available to their officials exercising law enforcement duties, while 

pursuing efforts to regulate and establish protocols for the training and use of less 

lethal weapons and in this regard strengthening international cooperation; 

 11. Further encourages States to accelerate the work on fulfilling the 2030 

Agenda for Sustainable Development,5 bearing in mind the importance of the full

inclusive institutions at all levels, as well as the systematic mainstreaming of a gender 

perspective;  

 12. Urges all States to ensure that all persons deprived of their liberty are

thereto of 8 June 1977,15 as well as other pertinent international instruments;  

 13. Welcomes the International Criminal Court as an important contribution to 

ending impunity concerning extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, and, 

noting the growing awareness of the Court worldwide, as highlighted during the 

twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Rome Statute of the Court,9 calls upon 

those States that are under an obligation to cooperate with the Court to provide such 

cooperation and assistance in the future, in particular with regard to arrest and 

surrender, the provision of evidence, the protection and relocation of victims and 

witnesses and the enforcement of sentences, also welcomes the fact that 123 States

including gender-sensitive tools, designed to encourage and facilitate greater 

attention to the protection of witnesses;  

 15. Encourages Governments and intergovernmental and non-governmental 

organizations to organize training programmes and to support projects with a view to 

training or educating military forces, law enforcement officers and government 

officials, as well as private personnel acting on behalf of the State, in international 

humanitarian and human rights law connected with their work, to include a gender 

and child rights perspective in such training and to require, where appropriate, that 

all private security providers have vetting and training procedures in place, including 

mandatory appropriate weapons training, that include human rights norms and 

principles, and appeals to the international community and requests the Office of the 

High Commissioner to support endeavours to that end;

elimination of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, and encourages the 

Special Rapporteur to continue, within the mandate, to collect information, including 

data disaggregated by sex, from all concerned, to respond effectively to reliable 

information that comes before him or her, to follow up on communications and 

country visits and to seek the views and comments of Governments and to reflect 

them, as appropriate, in reports;  

 18. Acknowledges the important role of the Special Rapporteur in identifying 

cases where extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions could amount to genocide 

and crimes against humanity or war crimes, and urges the Special Rapporteur to

that are of particularly serious concern or in which early action might prevent further 

deterioration;  

 19. Welcomes the cooperation established between the Special Rapporteur and 

other United Nations mechanisms and procedures in the field of human rights, and 

encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue efforts in that regard;  

 20. Urges all States, in particular those that have not done so, to cooperate 

with the Special Rapporteur so that the mandate can be carried out effectively,

appear not to have been respected;  

 24. Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with 

adequate human, financial and material resources to enable her to carry out the 

mandate effectively, including through country visits;  

 25. Also requests the Secretary-General to continue, in close collaboration 

with the High Commissioner and in conformity with the mandate of the High 

Commissioner, established by the General Assembly in its resolution 48/141 of 

20 December 1993, to ensure that personnel specialized in international humanitarian 

and human rights law, including in provisions related to gender equality, form part of 

United Nations missions, where appropriate, in order to deal with serious violati ons 

of human rights, such as extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions;  

 26. Requests the Special Rapporteur to submit to the General Assembly, at its
