 Stressing the critical role of women in the agricultural sector and their 
contribution to enhancing agricultural and rural development, improving food 
security and nutrition and eradicating rural poverty, and underlining the fact that 
meaningful progress in agricultural development necessitates, inter alia, closing the

agricultural technology and the training of smallholder farmers, in particular rural 
women,  

 Considering the increasing need to innovate in agriculture food chains in order 
to respond to the challenges posed by, inter alia, climate change, depletion and 
scarcity of natural resources, urbanization and globalization, and recognizing that 
agricultural research and sustainable agricultural technologies can greatly contribute 
to agricultural, rural and economic development, adaptation of agriculture and food 
security and nutrition and help mitigate the negative impact of climate change, 
desertification, land degradation and drought,

 2. Urges Member States, relevant United Nations organizations and other 
stakeholders to strengthen efforts to improve the development of sustainable 
agricultural technologies and their transfer and dissemination, under mutually 
agreed terms, to developing countries, especially the least developed countries, in 
particular at the bilateral and regional levels, and to support national efforts to foster 
utilization of local know-how and agricultural technologies, promote agricultural 
technology research and access to knowledge and information through suitable 
communication for development strategies and enable rural women, as well as men

other stakeholders to mainstream gender into agricultural policies and projects and 
to focus on closing the gender gap to achieve equal access for women to labour-
saving technologies, and agricultural technology information and know-how,

improving and diversifying crop varieties and seed systems, as well as supporting 
the establishment of sustainable agricultural systems and management practices, 
such as conservation agriculture, animal disease control and integrated pest 
management, in order to make agriculture more resilient and, in particular, to make 
crops and farm animals more tolerant to diseases, pests and environmental stresses, 
including drought and climate change, in accordance with national regulations and 
relevant international agreements;  

 8. Stresses the need to significantly reduce post-harvest and other food 
losses and waste throughout the food supply chain through, inter alia, increased
