S/2005/811

Taking note of the position of the Government on the evolution of ONUB’s
mandate, as presented to the Council on 30 November 2005 by Mrs Antoinette
Batumubwira, Minister of External Relations and International Co-operation, and
recorded in the letter to the President of the Security Council dated 23 November
2005 (S/2005/736),

Taking note of the report of the Security Council mission which visited the
region of Central Africa from 4 to 11 November 2005 (S/2005/716), and endorsing
its recommendations,

Expressing its serious concern at the continuation of hostilities by the Forces
nationals de Libération — Palipehutu (FNL), and at the threat they pose to civilians,

Noting that although there has been an improvement in the security situation
since the completion of the transitional period, factors of instability remain in
Burundi and in the Great Lakes region of Africa, which continue to constitute a
threat to international peace and security in the region,

Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,

to consult closely with the Government of Burundi, with a view to determining, on
the basis of the recommendations referred to in the letter dated 23 November 2005,
the modalities for implementing a gradual disengagement of the United Nations’
peacekeeping presence and of an adjustment to its mandate, taking into account all
the circumstances, as well as the merits of a United Nations contribution and
support to the consolidation of peace in Burundi;

assessment mentioned in paragraph 60 of his fifth report on ONUB, by 15 March

redeployment of military and civilian police personnel among ONUB and the United
Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC),
taking into account the need to ensure effective performance of the current mandates
of those missions, and requests in this regard the Secretary-General to begin
consultations with the countries contributing military and civilian police personnel
to those missions:

(a) the Secretary-General shall receive prior agreement of the countries
contributing military and civilian police personnel and of the Governments
concerned,

(b) he shall inform the Security Council in advance of his intention to make
such a redeployment, and in particular of its proposed scope and duration,

S/2005/811

6. Underlines that any personnel redeployed in accordance with paragraph 5
above shall continue to be counted against the authorized ceiling on military and
civilian personnel of the mission from which they are being transferred, and that any
such transfer shall not have the effect of extending the deployment of personnel
after the expiration of the mandate of their original mission, unless the Security
Council decides otherwise;

7. Urges the Government to complete the implementation of the programme
of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, including the effective
reintegration of former combatants;

be taken against those individuals who threaten this process;

9. Expresses its deep concern at the violations of human rights reported by
the Secretary-General, and urges the Government and other parties concerned to

responsible for such violations are brought to justice without delay;

10. Urges the international partners for the development of Burundi,
including the concerned bodies of the United Nations, to continue to provide their
support for the reconstruction of the country, particularly through an active
participation in the donors conference to be organized in early 2006;

11. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
