 Recognizing also that extreme poverty and hunger are a global threat that 
requires the collective commitment of the international community for its 
eradication, pursuant to Millennium Development Goal 1, and therefore calls upon 
the international community including the Human Rights Council to contribute 
towards achieving that Goal, 

 Recognizing further that historical injustices have undeniably contributed to 
the poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion, economic 
disparity, instability and insecurity that affect many people in different parts of the 
world, in particular in developing countries, 

 Stressing that poverty eradication is one of the critical elements in the 
promotion and realization of the right to development and that poverty is a 
multifaceted problem that requires a multifaceted and integrated approach in 
addressing economic, political, social, environmental and institutional dimensions at 
all levels, especially in the context of the Millennium Development Goal of halving, 
by 2015, the proportion of the world’s people whose income is less than one dollar a 
day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, 

 1. Endorses the conclusions and recommendations adopted by consensus by

Rights at its seventh session,9 and calls for their immediate, full and effective 
implementation by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights and other relevant actors; 

 2. Emphasizes the importance of the decisions contained in Human Rights 
Council resolution 2006 I/47 to renew the mandate of the Working Group for a 
period of one year and to request the Working Group to meet for a period of five 
working days in the first three months of 2007; 

 3. Endorses the request of the Human Rights Council to the high-level task 
force on the right to development to meet for a period of five working days before

contained in the report of the seventh session of the Working Group; 

 4. Emphasizes the relevant provisions of General Assembly resolution 
60/251 of 15 March 2006 establishing the Human Rights Council, and, in this 
regard, calls upon the Council: 

 (a) To act to ensure that its agenda promotes and advances sustainable 
development and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals; 

 (b) To agree on a programme that will lead to the elevation of the right to 
development to the same level as, in order that it may be on a par with, all other 
human rights and fundamental freedoms elaborated in the human rights instruments; 

 5. Notes with appreciation that the high-level task force, at its second 
meeting, examined Millennium Development Goal 8 on developing a global 
partnership for development and suggested criteria for its periodic evaluation with 
the aim of improving the effectiveness of global partnership with regard to the

 6. Stresses the importance of the core principles contained in the 
conclusions of the Working Group at its third session,12 congruent with the purpose 
of international human rights instruments, such as equality, non-discrimination, 
accountability, participation and international cooperation, as critical to 
mainstreaming the right to development at the national and international levels, and 
underlines the importance of the principles of equity and transparency; 

 7. Also stresses that it is important that the high-level task force and the 
Working Group in the discharge of their mandates take into account the need: 

 (a) To promote the democratization of the system of international 
governance in order to increase the effective participation of developing countries in 
international decision-making; 

 (b) To also promote effective partnerships such as the New Partnership for 
Africa’s Development10 and other similar initiatives with the developing countries, 
particularly the least developed countries, for the purpose of the realization of their 
right to development, including the achievement of the Millennium Development 
Goals; 

 (c) To strive for greater acceptance, operationalization and realization of the 
right to development at the international level, while urging all States to undertake 
at the national level the necessary policy formulation and to institute the measures 
required for the implementation of the right to development as a fundamental human 
right, and also urging all States to expand and deepen mutually beneficial 
cooperation in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development in 
the context of promoting effective international cooperation for the realization of the 
right to development, bearing in mind that lasting progress towards the 
implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies 
at the national level as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable 
economic environment at the international level; 

 (d) To consider ways and means to ensure the operationalization of the right 
to development as a priority, including through the elaboration of a convention on 
the right to development; 

 (e) To mainstream the right to development in the policies and operational 
activities of the United Nations and the specialized agencies, programmes and funds 
as well as in policies and strategies of the international financial and multilateral 
trading system, taking into account in this regard that the core principles of the 
international economic, commercial and financial spheres, such as equity, 
non-discrimination, transparency, accountability, participation and international 
cooperation, including effective partnerships for development, are indispensable in 
achieving the right to development and preventing discriminatory treatment arising 
out of political or other non-economic considerations, in addressing the issues of 
concern to the developing countries; 

 8. Reaffirms the request to the Subcommission on the Promotion and 
Protection of Human Rights or its successor expert advice mechanism to pursue its 
ongoing work on the right to development, particularly the submission of a concept 
document establishing options for the implementation of the right to development 
and their feasibility, inter alia, an international legal standard of a binding nature, in

accordance with the relevant provisions of General Assembly and Commission on 
Human Rights resolutions, and in compliance with decisions to be taken by the 
Human Rights Council, and requests the Secretary-General to report on progress in 
this regard to the Assembly at its sixty-second session; 

 9. Invites Member States and all other stakeholders to participate actively in 
future sessions of the Social Forum of the Subcommission on the Promotion and

previous three sessions of the Forum by the Subcommission; 

 10. Reaffirms the commitment to implement the goals and targets set out in 
all the outcome documents of the major United Nations conferences and summits

to development, recognizing that the realization of the right to development is 
critical to achieving the objectives, goals and targets set in those outcome 
documents; 

 11. Also reaffirms that the realization of the right to development is essential 
to the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action,3 which 
regards all human rights as universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, 
places the human person at the centre of development and recognizes that, while 
development facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights, the lack of development 
may not be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally recognized human 
rights; 

 12. Stresses that the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection 
of all human rights lies with the State, and reaffirms that States have the primary 
responsibility for their own economic and social development and that the role of 
national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized; 

 13. Reaffirms the primary responsibility of States to create national and 
international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to development as 
well as their commitment to cooperate with each other to that end; 

 14. Also reaffirms the need for an international environment that is 
conducive to the realization of the right to development; 

 15. Stresses the need to strive for greater acceptance, operationalization and 
realization of the right to development at the international and national levels, and 
calls upon States to institute the measures required for the implementation of the 
right to development as a fundamental human right; 

 16. Emphasizes the critical importance of identifying and analysing obstacles 
impeding the full realization of the right to development at both the national and the 
international levels; 

 17. Affirms that, while globalization offers both opportunities and challenges, 
the process of globalization remains deficient in achieving the objectives of 
integrating all countries into a globalized world, and stresses the need for policies 
and measures at the national and global levels to respond to the challenges and 
opportunities of globalization if this process is to be made fully inclusive and 
equitable; 



A/C.3/61/L.34  
 

06-60036 6 
 

 18. Recognizes that, despite continuous efforts on the part of the 
international community, the gap between developed and developing countries 
remains unacceptably wide, that developing countries continue to face difficulties in 
participating in the globalization process and that many risk being marginalized and 
effectively excluded from its benefits; 

 19. Underlines the fact that the international community is far from meeting 
the target set in the United Nations Millennium Declaration4 of halving the number 
of people living in poverty by 2015, reaffirms the commitment made to meet that 
target, and emphasizes the principle of international cooperation, including 
partnership and commitment, between developed and developing countries towards 
achieving the goal; 

 20. Urges developed countries that have not yet done so to make concrete 
efforts towards meeting the targets of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for 
official development assistance to developing countries and 0.15 to 0.2 per cent of 
their gross national product to least developed countries, and encourages developing 
countries to build on the progress achieved in ensuring that official development 
assistance is used effectively to help to meet development goals and targets; 

 21. Recognizes the need to address market access for developing countries, 
including in agriculture, services and non-agricultural products, in particular those 
of interest to developing countries; 

 22. Calls for the implementation of a desirable pace of meaningful trade 
liberalization, including in areas under negotiation; implementation of commitments 
on implementation-related issues and concerns; review of special and differential-
treatment provisions, with a view to strengthening them and making them more 
precise, effective and operational; avoidance of new forms of protectionism; and 
capacity-building and technical assistance for developing countries as important 
issues in making progress towards the effective implementation of the right to 
development; 

 23. Recognizes the important link between the international economic, 
commercial and financial spheres and the realization of the right to development, 
stresses, in this regard, the need for good governance and broadening the base of 
decision-making at the international level on issues of development concern and the 
need to fill organizational gaps, as well as strengthen the United Nations system and 
other multilateral institutions, and also stresses the need to broaden and strengthen 
the participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition 
in international economic decision-making and norm-setting; 

 24. Also recognizes that good governance and the rule of law at the national 
level assist all States in the promotion and protection of human rights, including the 
right to development, and agrees on the value of the ongoing efforts being made by 
States to identify and strengthen good governance practices, including transparent, 
responsible, accountable and participatory government, that are responsive and 
appropriate to their needs and aspirations, including in the context of agreed 
partnership approaches to development, capacity-building and technical assistance; 

 25. Further recognizes the important role and the rights of women and the 
application of a gender perspective as a cross-cutting issue in the process of 
realizing the right to development, and notes in particular the positive relationship 
between women’s education and their equal participation in the civil, cultural,

economic, political and social activities of the community and the promotion of the 
right to development; 

 26. Stresses the need for the integration of the rights of children, girls and 
boys alike, in all policies and programmes, and for ensuring the promotion and 
protection of those rights, especially in areas relating to health, education and the full 
development of their capacities; 

 27. Also stresses that further and additional measures must be taken at the 
national and international levels to fight HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases, 
taking into account ongoing efforts and programmes, and reiterates the need for 
international assistance in this regard; 

 28. Recognizes the need for strong partnerships with civil society 
organizations and the private sector in pursuit of poverty eradication and 
development, as well as for corporate social responsibility; 

 29. Emphasizes the urgent need for taking concrete and effective measures to 
prevent, combat and criminalize all forms of corruption at all levels, to prevent, detect 
and deter in a more effective manner international transfers of illicitly acquired assets 
and to strengthen international cooperation in asset recovery consistent with the 
principles of the United Nations Convention against Corruption,13 particularly 
chapter V thereof, stresses the importance of a genuine political commitment on the 
part of all Governments through a firm legal framework, and in this context urges 
States to sign and ratify as soon as possible, and States parties to implement 
effectively, the Convention; 

 30. Also emphasizes the need to strengthen further the activities of the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the promotion and 
realization of the right to development, including ensuring effective use of the 
financial and human resources necessary to fulfil its mandate, and calls upon the 
Secretary-General to provide the Office of the High Commissioner with the necessary 
resources; 

 31. Reaffirms the request to the High Commissioner, in mainstreaming the 
right to development, to undertake effectively activities aimed at strengthening the 
global partnership for development between Member States, development agencies 
and the international development, financial and trade institutions, and to reflect those 
activities in detail in her report to the Human Rights Council at its fourth session; 

 32. Calls upon the United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, as well as 
the specialized agencies, to mainstream the right to development in their operational 
programmes and objectives, and stresses the need for the international financial and 
multilateral trading systems to mainstream the right to development in their policies 
and objectives; 

 33. Requests the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the 
attention of Member States, United Nations organs and bodies, specialized agencies, 
funds and programmes, international development and financial institutions, in 
particular the Bretton Woods institutions, and non-governmental organizations;
