 Reaffirming the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of 
Nepal and its ownership of the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace

 Recalling the signing on 21 November 2006 by the Government of Nepal and

the stated commitment of both parties to find a permanent and sustainable peace, 
and commending the steps taken to date to implement the Agreement,

timely and effective implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and 
subsequent agreements, in particular the 25 June 2008 Agreement, as requested by 
the Government of Nepal, 

 Welcoming the progress the Constituent Assembly has since made towards 
writing a new democratic constitution of Nepal within the stipulated time frame 
since the successful conclusion of the Constituent Assembly elections on 10 April 
2008, 

 Noting with concern recent developments, and encouraging renewed and 
sustained efforts to create a unified approach among the political parties, including 
through the proposal for a high-level consultative mechanism as a forum for

 Echoing the Secretary-General’s call for all parties in Nepal to move forward 
swiftly in the implementation of the agreements reached, noting the Secretary-
General’s assessment that the United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) will be 
well placed to assist in the management of arms and armed personnel in accordance 
with the 25 June 2008 Agreement between the political parties, and recognising 
UNMIN’s willingness to assist the parties in this, as requested, in order to achieve a 
durable solution,  

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 14 July 2009 on UNMIN,  

 Recalling the completion of two phases of the verification process and 
welcoming continuing assistance with the management of arms and armed personnel 
of both sides in accordance with resolution 1740 (2007) and in line with the 
provisions of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, noting the importance of a 
durable long term solution in helping to create the conditions for completion of 
UNMIN’s activities, noting also in this regard the need to address outstanding issues 
without further delay, and welcoming in this regard the decision by the Government 
of Nepal and the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) formally to launch the 
discharge and rehabilitation process for the disqualified Maoist army personnel, 
including minors, and calling upon all political parties to implement this process 
fully and expeditiously, and for continued reporting on this issue as required under 
resolution 1612 (2005), 

 Recalling that with the successful holding of the Constituent Assembly 
elections, some of the elements of the mandate of UNMIN as set out in resolution 
1740 (2007) have already been accomplished, 

 Welcoming the action plan which the Government of Nepal has committed to 
prepare, the implementation of which will facilitate UNMIN’s withdrawal from 
Nepal, 

 Taking note of the Government of Nepal’s letter to the Secretary-General of 
7 July 2009 (S/2009/360), which recognises UNMIN’s contribution and requests an 
extension of the mandate of UNMIN for six months, and further taking note of the 
commitments of the Government of Nepal to reconstitute the Special Committee 
strengthened with the support of the Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction, and also 
for beginning the process of integration and rehabilitation of Maoist army personnel,  

 Recognizing the need to pay special attention to the needs and the role of 
women, children and traditionally marginalized groups in the peace process, as 
mentioned in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and resolution 1325 (2000),  

 Recognizing the need to address impunity and to promote and protect human 
rights through building the capacity of independent national institutions, 

 Recognizing that civil society can play an important role in democratic 
transition and conflict prevention, 

 Expressing appreciation for the contribution of the Secretary-General’s 
Representative and the efforts of her team in UNMIN, and the United Nations 
Country Team, including the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
which is monitoring human rights at the request of the government, and stressing the 
need for coordination and complementarity of efforts between the mission and all 
the United Nations actors in the mission area, particularly in order to ensure 
continuity, as the mandate comes to an end,

 1. Decides in line with the request from the Government of Nepal and the 
Secretary-General’s recommendations, to renew the mandate of UNMIN as 
established under resolution 1740 (2007) until 23 January 2010, taking into account 
the completion of some elements of the mandate, the ongoing work on the 
monitoring and the management of arms and armed personnel in line with the 
25 June Agreement 2008 among the political parties, which will support the 
completion of the peace process;  

 2. Calls upon all parties to take full advantage of the expertise and 
readiness of UNMIN, within its mandate, to support the peace process to facilitate 
the completion of outstanding aspects of UNMIN’s mandate by 23 January 2010;  

 3. Concurs with the Secretary-General’s view that the current monitoring

Government of Nepal to consider necessary measures to end the present monitoring 
arrangements;  

 4. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Security Council by 
30 October 2009 on the implementation of this resolution, and progress in creating

decisions to create conditions conducive to completion of UNMIN’s activities by the 
end of the current mandate, including through implementation of the 25 June 2008 
Agreement, in order to facilitate UNMIN’s withdrawal from Nepal;  

 6. Welcomes progress achieved so far, and calls upon all political parties in 
Nepal to expedite the peace process, and to work together in a spirit of cooperation, 
consensus and compromise in order to continue the transition to a durable long-term 
solution to enable the country to move to a peaceful, democratic and more 
prosperous future;  

 7. Requests the parties in Nepal to take the necessary steps to promote the 
safety, security and freedom of movement of UNMIN and associated personnel in
