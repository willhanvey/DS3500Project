  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 

draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 10 July 2020 on his Good 

Offices (S/2020/685) and on the United Nations operation in Cyprus (S/2020/682), 

and expressing its full support for his Good Offices to remain available to assist the 

sides, should they jointly decide to re-engage in negotiations with the necessary 

political will, 

 Underscoring that the responsibility for finding a solution lies first and foremost 

with the Cypriots themselves, and reaffirming the primary role of the United Nations 

in assisting the parties to bring the Cyprus conflict and division of the island to a 

comprehensive and durable settlement with a sense of urgency,  

 Urging the sides to renew their efforts to achieve an enduring, comprehensive 

and just settlement based on a bicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality, 

as set out in relevant Security Council resolutions, including OP4 of its resolution 

716 (1991), and stressing that the status quo is unsustainable,  

 Expressing deep concern at the further escalation and increased tensions in the 

eastern Mediterranean over hydrocarbons exploration, convinced of the many 

important benefits, including economic benefits, for all Cypriots that would flow from 

a comprehensive and durable settlement, and reiterating the Secretary-General’s call 

for serious efforts to avoid any further escalation and to defuse tensions,  

 Recalling its resolution 1325 (2000) and related resolutions, recognising that 

the full, effective and meaningful participation and leadership of women is essential 

in building peace in Cyprus and will contribute to making any future settlement 

sustainable, welcoming efforts to bring together a broader range of women actors on 

both sides, encouraging the sides to ensure the unique concerns of women are 

addressed in a future settlement, and looking forward to the outcome of the gender-

sensitive socio-economic impact assessment requested in its resolution 2453 (2019), 

 Recalling its resolution 2250 (2015) that recognises the important and positive 

contribution of youth in efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and 

security, and as a key aspect of the sustainability, inclusiveness and success of 

peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts, and further encourages the full, effective 

and meaningful participation of youth in this process,  

 Recognising that effective contact and communication between the sides 

enhances the prospects for settlement and is in the interests of all Cypriots, and helps 

to address island-wide matters, including environmental protection and crime,

Recognising the impact on the island of Cyprus of the COVID-19 pandemic and the 

efforts made by both communities to suppress the spread of the virus and mitigate its effects, 

Further recognising that the COVID-19 pandemic has restricted opportunities and 

capacity for negotiation, and expressing concern that the uncoordinated decisions to close 

the crossing points along the Green line in response to the pandemic have prevented most 

bi-communal engagement, and that the prolonged closure of the crossing points threatens to 

set back the progress made in this area since 2003, 

 Expressing concern at the continued deterioration of the law and order situation 

in Pyla, and urging both sides to continue to work with UNFICYP to establish 

effective measures to tackle criminal activities,  

 Emphasising the importance of confidence-building measures and their timely 

implementation, and urging the sides to step up their efforts to promote 

intercommunal contacts, reconciliation and the active engagement of civil society, in 

particular women and youth, 

 Noting that the Government of Cyprus is agreed that in view of the prevailing 

conditions on the island it is necessary to keep the United Nations Peacekeeping Force 

in Cyprus (UNFICYP) beyond 31 July 2020,  

 Welcoming measures to date to strengthen the liaison and engagement capacity 

of the mission, noting the importance of transition planning in relation to the 

settlement, and emphasising the need to review regularly all peacekeeping operations, 

including UNFICYP, to ensure efficiency and effectiveness,  

 Echoing the Secretary-General’s gratitude to the Government of Cyprus and the 

Government of Greece for their voluntary contributions to the funding o f UNFICYP, 

and expressing appreciation to Member States that contribute personnel to UNFICYP,  

 Noting with appreciation the efforts of the Secretary-General, his Special 

Representative Elizabeth Spehar, and senior United Nations official Jane Holl Lute,  

 1. Welcomes the trilateral meeting of the leaders and the Secretary-General 

on 25 November 2019 in Berlin, at which both sides reaffirmed their commitment to 

a bicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality, as set out in relevant 

Security Council resolutions, including OP4 of its resolution 716 (1991), the Joint 

Declaration of 11 February 2014, the prior convergences, and the six point framework 

presented by the Secretary-General on 30 June 2017 at the Conference of Cyprus; 

 2. Further welcomes the Secretary-General’s agreement to extend his efforts 

to achieve terms of reference to serve as a consensus starting point for phased, 

meaningful, and results-oriented negotiations at the earliest feasible opportunity, and 

urges the sides and all involved participants to renew their political will and 

commitment to a settlement under United Nations auspices, including by engaging 

actively and with a sense of urgency with the Secretary-General and senior United 

Nations official, Jane Holl Lute; 

 3. Reiterates its call for a reduction of tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean, 

and further calls upon the leaders of the two Cypriot communities and all involved 

parties to refrain from any actions and rhetoric that might damage chances of success; 

 4. Reaffirms all its relevant resolutions on Cyprus, in particular resolution 

1251 (1999); 

 5. Recalls its resolution 2506 (2020) and calls upon the two leaders urgently

 (b) reaffirm their political support for all Technical Committees, empower 

them to submit proposals for their consideration to enhance intercommunal contacts 

and improve the daily lives of all Cypriots, and consider the advice of the Good 

Offices Mission of the Secretary-General regarding further ways to empower the 

Technical Committees and improve their performance; 

 (c) ensure effective coordination and cooperation on health matters, including 

in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious diseases which have 

island-wide implications, including through the effective use of the expertise 

available in the bi-communal Technical Committees on Health, Crisis Management, 

Humanitarian Affairs and Economic Matters;  

 (d) ensure effective coordination and cooperation on criminal matters;  

 (e) promote peace education across the island, including by further 

empowering the Technical Committee on Education to implement the 

recommendations contained in its joint report of 2017, in particular those concerning 

policy-making, and to address impediments to peace in school materials, including 

text books, as a contribution to trust-building between the communities, on which 

there continues to be little progress;  

 (f) improve the public atmosphere for negotiation to secure a settlement, 

including by preparing the communities for a settlement through publi c messages on 

convergences and the way ahead, and delivering more constructive and harmonised 

messages, and by refraining from actions or rhetoric that detracts from a successful 

process or could make it more difficult to achieve, recalling the Secretary-General’s 

statement of 25 November 2019 in this regard;  

 (g) increase their support to, and ensure a meaningful role for, civil society 

engagement in peace efforts, in particular strengthening the participation of women ’s 

organisations and youth in the process, including by empowering the Technical 

Committee on Gender Equality to meet and develop an action plan supporting 

women’s full, effective and meaningful participation in peace talks and providing 

direct support and encouragement to civil society organisations to enhance inter-

communal contact and trust-building; 

 6. Calls for the establishment of an effective mechanism for direct military 

contacts between the sides and the relevant involved parties, encourages full 

engagement with the proposal on the establishment of such a mechanism presented 

by UNFICYP, and calls for its timely implementation; 

 7. Calls upon the sides to reduce existing barriers to intercommunal contact, 

and emphasizes the importance of effective communication for risk-mitigation and 

trust-building between the communities; 

 8. Further calls for the reopening of all the crossing points and the return to 

the operating status that existed prior to 29 February 2020 as soon as practically 

achievable, and for any continuing restrictions on movement across the island to 

prevent the spread of COVID-19 to be coordinated, and not go beyond what is 

necessary to protect public health; and noting that the opening of the crossings since 

2003 has been an important confidence-building measure between both communities 

and one which is essential for the settlement process;  

 9. Welcomes the progress towards the inter-operability of mobile phones 

across the island, and calls for further work to ensure the arrangement is made more 

broadly available and affordable to subscribers on both sides of the island, and urges 

the sides to agree and implement further confidence building measures, including 

those related to the military, economic cooperation and trade;

 10. Commends the work of the Committee on Missing Persons, and calls upon 

all parties expeditiously to enhance their cooperation with the Committee ’s work, in 

particular through providing full access to all areas and responding in a timely manner 

to requests for archival information on possible burial sites;  

 11. Expresses its full support for UNFICYP, and decides to extend its mandate 

for a further period ending on 31January 2021; 

 12. Expresses serious concern at the increased number and severity of 

violations of the military status quo along the ceasefire lines, urges the sides and all 

involved parties to respect UNFICYP’s mandated authority in, and delineation of, the

ensure peace and security in the buffer zone, and calls on both sides to prevent 

unauthorised activities between the ceasefire lines;  

 13. Calls on the Turkish Cypriot side and Turkish forces to restore in Strovilia 

the military status quo which existed there prior to 30 June 2000, recalls the status of 

Varosha as set out in relevant resolutions, including resolutions 550 (1984) and 789 

(1992), and reaffirms that UNFICYP’s freedom of movement should be respected;  

 14. Welcomes the announcement that 18 suspected hazardous areas across the 

island have now been cleared of mines, and urges the leaders of both communities to 

agree and continue a plan of work to achieve a mine-free Cyprus; 

 15. Requests UNFICYP to take fully into account gender considerations as a 

cross-cutting issue throughout its mandate; requests the Secretary-General and troop- 

and police-contributing countries to increase the number of women in UNFICYP and 

ensure the full, effective and meaningful participation of women in all aspects of its 

operations; 

 16. Welcomes the initiatives undertaken by the Secretary-General to 

standardise a culture of performance in UN peacekeeping, recalls its requests in its 

resolutions 2378 (2017) and 2436 (2018) that the Secretary-General ensure that 

performance data related to the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations is used to 

improve mission operations, including decisions such as those regarding deployment, 

remediation, repatriation and incentives, reaffirms its support for the development of 

a comprehensive and integrated performance policy framework that identifies clear 

standards of performance for evaluating all United Nations civilian and uniformed 

personnel working in and supporting peacekeeping operations that facilitates 

effective and full implementation of mandates, and includes comprehensive and 

objective methodologies based on clear and well-defined benchmarks to ensure 

accountability for underperformance and incentives and recognition for outstanding 

performance, calls on the United Nations to apply this framework to UNFICYP as 

described in its resolution 2436 (2018), and notes the efforts of the Secretary-General 

to develop a comprehensive performance assessment system;  

 17. Requests the Secretary-General to continue to take necessary measures to 

ensure full compliance of all UNFICYP personnel, civilian and uniformed, including 

mission leadership and mission support personnel, with the United Nations zero -

tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and to keep the Council fully 

informed about the Mission’s progress in this regard, stresses the need to prevent such 

exploitation and abuse and to improve how these allegations are addressed in line 

with its resolution 2272 (2016), and urges troop- and police-contributing countries to 

continue to take appropriate preventative action, including vetting of all personnel, 

pre-deployment and in-mission awareness training, and to take appropriate steps to 

ensure full accountability in cases of such conduct involving their personnel, 

including through timely investigations of allegations by troop- and police-

contributing countries, and UNFICYP as appropriate, holding perpetrators to account,
