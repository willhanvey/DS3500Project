20-13582 2/3 

 

to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the 

nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament,  

 Recalling the principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and 

disarmament adopted at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to 

the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,2 the unequivocal 

commitment of nuclear-weapon States to accomplish the total elimination of their 

nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament, agreed at the 2000 Review 

Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,3 

and the action points agreed at the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the 

Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as part of the conclusions and 

recommendations for follow-on actions on nuclear disarmament,4 

 Sharing the deep concern at the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any 

use of nuclear weapons, and in this context reaffirming the need for all States at all 

times to comply with applicable international law, including international 

humanitarian law, 

 Calling upon all nuclear-weapon States to undertake concrete disarmament 

efforts, and stressing that all States need to make special efforts to achieve and 

maintain a world without nuclear weapons,  

 Recalling the five-point proposal for nuclear disarmament of the Secretary-

General, in which he proposes, inter alia, the consideration of negotiations on a 

nuclear weapons convention or agreement on a framework of separate mutually 

reinforcing instruments, backed by a strong system of verification,  

 Noting continued efforts towards realizing nuclear disarmament, including 

through the Secretary-General’s disarmament agenda, Securing Our Common Future: 

An Agenda for Disarmament, 

 Recalling the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in its 

resolution 50/245 of 10 September 1996, and expressing its satisfaction at the 

increasing number of States that have signed and ratified the Treaty,  

 Recognizing with satisfaction that the Antarctic Treaty,5 the treaties of 

Tlatelolco,6 Rarotonga,7 Bangkok8 and Pelindaba9 and the Treaty on a Nuclear-

Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia, as well as Mongolia’s nuclear-weapon-free status, 

are gradually freeing the entire southern hemisphere and adjacent areas covered by 

those treaties from nuclear weapons, 

 Recognizing the need for a multilaterally negotiated and legally binding 

instrument to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the threat or use of nuclear 

weapons pending the total elimination of nuclear weapons,

3/3 20-13582 

 

 Reaffirming the central role of the Conference on Disarmament as the sole 

multilateral disarmament negotiating forum,  

 Emphasizing the need for the Conference on Disarmament to commence 

negotiations on a phased programme for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons 

with a specified framework of time,  

 Stressing the urgent need for the nuclear-weapon States to accelerate concrete 

progress on the 13 practical steps to implement article VI of the Treaty on the 

Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons leading to nuclear disarmament, contained in 

the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference,  

 Recalling the Model Nuclear Weapons Convention submitted to the Secretary-

General by Costa Rica and Malaysia in 2007 and circulated by the Secretary -

General,10 

 Welcoming the adoption on 7 July 2017 of the Treaty on the Prohibition of 

Nuclear Weapons,11 which has contributed to achieving the objective of a legally 

binding prohibition of the development, production, testing, deployment, stockpiling, 

threat or use of nuclear weapons and their destruction under effective inte rnational 

control, 

 Recalling the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the 

legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons, issued on 8 July 1996, 12 

 1. Underlines once again the unanimous conclusion of the International 

Court of Justice that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a 

conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict 

and effective international control;  

 2. Calls once again upon all States to immediately engage in multilateral 

negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective 

international control, including under the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear 

Weapons; 

 3. Requests all States to inform the Secretary-General of the efforts and 

measures which they have taken with respect to the implementation of the present 

resolution and nuclear disarmament, and requests the Secretary-General to apprise 

the General Assembly of that information at its seventy-sixth session; 

 4. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-sixth session, 

under the item entitled “General and complete disarmament”, the sub-item entitled
