 2. Emphasizes that the Government of Liberia bears primary and ultimate 
responsibility for security and, recognizing that the Government must prioritize in

to continue to support the Government in order to solidify peace and stability in 
Liberia and to protect civilians, and that UNMIL shall also support the 
Government’s efforts, as appropriate, to achieve a successful transition of complete

security responsibilities, and coordinate these efforts with all partners, including the 
Government of Liberia, the national police leadership, and donor partners;

population through the establishment of sustainable and effective security forces 
with a view to progressively take over UNMIL’s security role;

transition goals, and requests the Secretary-General to ensure that UNMIL has the 
requisite qualified specialist advisors who have the professional skills and 
experience appropriate to this transition phase in order to enhance mentoring in 
priority areas, as outlined in the Secretary-General’s report S/2012/230; and 
requests that such qualified specialist advisors be made available to the SRSG to fill 
gaps that might exist in meeting the goal of increasing the capacity of the

enhance their cooperation, particularly with respect to the border area, including
