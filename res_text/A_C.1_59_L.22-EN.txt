Agenda item 65 (t)
General and complete disarmament: towards a
nuclear-weapon-free world: a new agenda

Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden:
draft resolution

Accelerating the implementation of nuclear disarmament
commitments

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolution 58/51 of 8 December 2003, and mindful of the
upcoming 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,

Expressing its grave concern at the danger to humanity posed by the
possibility that nuclear weapons could be used and at the lack of implementation of
binding obligations and agreed steps towards nuclear disarmament, and reaffirming
that nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are mutually reinforcing
processes requiring urgent irreversible progress on both fronts,

Recalling the unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon States to
accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals, leading to nuclear
disarmament, in accordance with commitments made under article VI of the Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,1 and noting that the ultimate
objective of the disarmament process is general and complete disarmament under
strict and effective international control,

1. Calls upon all States to fully comply with commitments made regarding
nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation and not to act in any way that
may be detrimental to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation or that may lead to
a new nuclear arms race;

2. Also calls upon all States to spare no efforts to achieve universal
adherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons1 and the early
entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty;

3. Calls upon all States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons to accelerate the implementation of the practical steps for
systematic and progressive efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament that were agreed
upon at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons;2

4. Calls upon the nuclear-weapon States to take further steps to reduce their
non-strategic nuclear arsenals and not to develop new types of nuclear weapons, in
accordance with their commitment to diminish the role of nuclear weapons in their
security policies;

5. Agrees urgently to strengthen efforts towards both nuclear disarmament
and nuclear non-proliferation through the resumption in the Conference on
Disarmament of negotiations on a non-discriminatory, multilateral and
internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile
material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, in accordance with
the statement of the special coordinator in 19953 and the mandate contained therein,
taking into account both nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation
objectives, as well as the completion and implementation of arrangements by all
nuclear-weapon States to place fissile material no longer required for military
purposes under international verification;

6. Calls for the establishment of an appropriate subsidiary body in the
Conference on Disarmament to deal with nuclear disarmament;

7. Underlines the imperative of the principles of irreversibility and
transparency for all nuclear disarmament measures and the need to develop further
adequate and efficient verification capabilities;

8. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixtieth session the
item entitled “Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: accelerating the
implementation of nuclear disarmament commitments”, and to review the
implementation of the present resolution at that session.
