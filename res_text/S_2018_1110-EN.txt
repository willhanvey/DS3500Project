(S/PRST/2015/15), 

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 

territorial integrity of Syria and to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the 

United Nations, 

 Expressing outrage at the unacceptable level of violence and the killing of 

hundreds of thousands of people, including tens of thousands of child casualties, as a 

result of the Syrian conflict,  

 Reiterating its grave distress at the continued devastating humanitarian situation 

in Syria and at the fact that urgent humanitarian assistance, including medical 

assistance, is required by more than 13 million people in Syria, of whom 6.2 million 

are internally displaced, including Palestine refugees, and more than 1 million people 

are still living in hard-to-reach areas,

 Noting the progress made in taking back areas of Syria from the Islamic State 

in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as Daesh) and Al-Nusrah Front (ANF) but 

expressing its grave concern that areas remain under their control and about the

populations which has led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people and 

the unlawful destruction of cultural heritage, reaffirming its resolve to address all 

aspects of the threat posed by ISIL (also known as Daesh), ANF and all other 

individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida and other 

terrorist groups, as determined by the United Nations Security Council and as may 

further be agreed by the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) and endorsed by 

the UN Security Council and calling for the full implementation of Security Council 

resolutions 2170 (2014), 2178 (2014), 2199 (2015), 2249 (2015), 2253 (2015), 2347 

(2017), 2354 (2017), 2368 (2017) and 2370 (2017), 

 Expressing grave concern also at the movement of foreign terrorist fighters and 

other terrorists and terrorist groups into and out of Syria and reiterating its call on all 

States to take steps, consistent with international law, to prevent and suppress the flow 

of foreign terrorist fighters to ISIL, ANF and all other individuals, groups, 

undertakings and entities associated with ISIL or Al-Qaida and other terrorist groups, 

as determined by the United Nations Security Council, and as may further be agreed 

by the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) and endorsed by the UN Security 

Council, 

 Reaffirming that Member States must ensure that any measures taken to combat 

terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, in particular 

international human rights law, international refugee law and international 

humanitarian law, 

 Reaffirming the primary responsibility of the Syrian authorities to protect the 

population in Syria and reiterating that parties to armed conflict must take all feasible 

steps to protect civilians and recalling in this regard its demand that all parties to 

armed conflict comply fully with the obligations applicable to them under 

international law related to the protection of civilians in armed conflict, including 

journalists, media professionals and associated personnel,  

 Reiterating its strong condemnation of all forms of violence and intimidation to 

which those participating in humanitarian operations are continue to be exposed, as 

well as attacks on humanitarian convoys and acts of destruction and looting of their 

assets and its urging of all parties involved in an armed conflict to promote the safety, 

security and freedom of movement of humanitarian personnel, including medical 

personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties and 

United Nations and its associated personnel and their assets, expressing its ongoing 

admiration at the dedication and commitment of the Syrian Red Crescent volunteers 

and other humanitarian workers operating in deeply challenging conditions and 

urging all parties to take all appropriate steps to ensure the safety and security of 

United Nations and associated personnel, those of its specialised agencies and all 

other personnel engaged in humanitarian relief activities,  

 Noting that the United Nations and their implementing partners reached on 

average 5.4 million people with humanitarian aid each month in 2018 and that life -

saving assistance delivered across borders represented a vital part of this, including 

the delivery of food assistance for on average 1 million people every month in 2018; 

and since the start of operations in 2014, non-food items for 6 million people; health 

assistance through 25 million treatments and water and sanitation supplies for over 

5 million people, 

 Reiterating its grave concern at all instances of hindrances to the effective 

delivery of humanitarian assistance, noting that ISIL (also known as Daesh), ANF and 

all other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, are 

hindering the effective delivery of humanitarian assistance and are responsible for 

preventing aid delivery through deliberate interference and obstruction,

 Reiterating further its grave concern at the continuing impediments to the 

delivery of sustained, needs-based humanitarian assistance across the country through 

the most direct routes, including to hard-to-reach areas and across conflict lines,  

 Expressing grave concern that access to medical care continues to be severely 

restricted and reiterating the need to respect the principle of medical neutrality, 

facilitate free passage to all areas for medical personnel, equipment, transport and 

supplies, including surgical items,  

 Reaffirming the need to support the United Nations and their implementing 

partners in their efforts to expand the delivery of humanitarian assistance to reach all 

people in need in Syria and further reaffirming its decision in resolution 2165 (2014) 

that all Syrian parties to the conflict shall enable the immediate and unhindered 

delivery of humanitarian assistance directly to people throughout Syria, by the United 

Nations and their implementing partners, on the basis of United Nations assessments 

of need and devoid of any political prejudices and aims, including by immediately 

removing all impediments to the provision of humanitarian assistance,  

 Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General of 19 June 2018 (S/2018/617) 

on the Review of the United Nations Cross-Border Operations and further taking note 

of ongoing efforts to implement the recommendations contained therein, and stressing 

the need to ensure that the delivery of humanitarian aid and services, including at the 

stage of distribution, is impartial, non-discriminatory and needs-based and that those 

most in need are beneficiaries of such aid and services, without misappropriation,  

 Expressing its appreciation for the work of the United Nations monitoring 

mechanism in monitoring shipments and confirming their humanitarian nature, in 

accordance with resolutions 2165 (2014), 2191 (2014), 2258 (2015), 2332 (2016) and 

2393 (2017) and commending the mechanism’s efforts in facilitating cross-border 

delivery of humanitarian aid by the United Nations and their implementing partners, 

emphasising the importance to further robust monitoring of the humanitarian nature 

of UN relief consignments and their delivery inside Syria and encouraging the United 

Nations and their implementing partners to continue to take steps to scale up 

humanitarian deliveries throughout the country, notably into hard -to-reach areas, 

 Reiterating the need for all parties to respect and uphold the relevant provisions 

of international humanitarian law and the United Nations guiding principles of 

humanitarian emergency assistance, emphasising the importance of upholding the 

principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, in the provision of 

humanitarian assistance and recalling also the importance of humanitarian deliveries 

reaching their intended beneficiaries,  

 Noting the role that ceasefire agreements which are consistent with 

humanitarian principles and international humanitarian law can play in facilitating 

the delivery of humanitarian assistance in order to help save civilian lives, reiterating 

its call upon all parties to respect and fulfil their commitments to existing ceasefire 

agreements, as well as the full implementation of resolution 2268 (2016) and 2401 

(2018), as a step towards a comprehensive nation-wide ceasefire and emphasising that 

humanitarian access must be part of these efforts in accordance with  international 

humanitarian law, 

 Expressing grave concern at the more than 5.6 million refugees, including more 

than 4.2 million women and children, who have fled Syria as a result of ongoing 

violence, 

 Reiterating its deep appreciation for the significant and admirable efforts that 

have been made by the countries of the region, notably Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq 

and Egypt, to accommodate Syrian refugees and mindful of the immense costs and 

social challenges incurred by these countries as a consequence of the crisis,

 Recalling the need to create conditions throughout the country and facilitate the 

safe, voluntary and dignified return of refugees and internally displaced persons to 

their home areas in Syria, in accordance with international law, including applicable 

provisions of the Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, taking 

into account the interests of those countries hosting refugees,  

 Calling upon the international community to increase their assistance to Syria 

by providing additional humanitarian aid, noting with concern that the international 

response to the Syrian and regional crisis continues to fall short of meeting the needs 

as assessed by host governments and the United Nations, therefore urging once again 

all Member States, based on burden-sharing principles, to support the United Nations 

and the countries of the region, including by adopting medium and long -term 

responses to alleviate the impact on communities, providing increased, flexible and 

predictable funding as well as increasing resettlement efforts and noting the second 

conference on supporting the future of Syria and the region held in Brussels in April 

2018, co-chaired by the European Union and the United Nations,  

 Calling for humanitarian mine action to be accelerated as a matter of urgency 

throughout Syria, 

 Strongly condemning the arbitrary detention and torture of individuals in Syria, 

notably in prisons and detention facilities, as well as the kidnappings, abductions, 

hostage-taking and forced disappearances and demanding the immediate end of these 

practices and the release of all arbitrarily detained persons starting with women and 

children, as well as sick, wounded, persons with disabilities and elderly persons and 

United Nations and humanitarian personnel and journalists,  

 Noting with grave concern that impunity in Syria contributes to widespread 

violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitari an 

law, stressing the need to end impunity for these violations and abuses and 

re-emphasising in this regard that those who have committed or are otherwise 

responsible for such violations and abuses in Syria must be brought to justice,  

 Emphasising that the humanitarian situation will continue to deteriorate further 

in the absence of a political solution to the Syrian conflict in line with resolution 2254 

(2015) and calling upon all parties to make progress in this regard and to undertake 

confidence-building measures and recognising the efforts by the Office of the UN 

Special Envoy and the international community, including within the Astana 

framework, to advance the early release of any arbitrarily detained persons, 

particularly women and children, and handover of the bodies as well as the 

identification of missing persons,  

 Determining that the devastating humanitarian situation in Syria continues to 

constitute a threat to peace and security in the region,
