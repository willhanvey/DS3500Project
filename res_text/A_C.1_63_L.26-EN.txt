Nations and the rules of humanitarian international law, 

 Recalling its resolution 62/30 of 5 December 2007,

negotiations on arms regulation and disarmament,

international organizations on the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions 
containing depleted uranium, as reflected in the report submitted by the 
Secretary-General pursuant to resolution 62/30,1 

 Convinced that as humankind is more aware of the need to take immediate 
measures to protect the environment, any event that could jeopardize such efforts 
requires urgent attention to implement the required measures, 

 Taking into consideration the potential harmful effects of the use of armaments 
and ammunitions containing depleted uranium on human health and the 
environment,  

 1. Expresses its appreciation to the Member States and international 
organizations that submitted their views to the Secretary-General pursuant to
