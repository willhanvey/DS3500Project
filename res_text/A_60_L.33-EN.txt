Jerusalem

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolution 181 (II) of 29 November 1947, in particular its
provisions regarding the City of Jerusalem,

Recalling also its resolution 36/120 E of 10 December 1981 and all subsequent
resolutions, including resolution 56/31 of 3 December 2001, in which it, inter alia,
determined that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by
Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purported to alter the character
and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem, in particular the so-called “Basic Law” on
Jerusalem and the proclamation of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, were null and
void and must be rescinded forthwith,

Recalling further Security Council resolutions relevant to Jerusalem, including
resolution 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980, in which the Council, inter alia, decided
not to recognize the “Basic Law” and called upon those States which had
established diplomatic missions in Jerusalem to withdraw such missions from the
Holy City,

Recalling also the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the
International Court of Justice on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a
Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,1 and recalling resolution ES-10/15 of
20 July 2004,

Expressing its grave concern at any action taken by any body, governmental or
non-governmental, in violation of the above-mentioned resolutions,

A/60/L.33

Expressing its grave concern in particular about the continuation by Israel, the
occupying Power, of illegal settlement activities and its construction of the wall in
and around East Jerusalem and the further isolation of the city from the rest of the
Occupied Palestinian Territory, which is having a detrimental effect on the lives of
Palestinians and could prejudge a final status agreement on Jerusalem,

Reaffirming that the international community, through the United Nations, has
a legitimate interest in the question of the City of Jerusalem and the protection of
the unique spiritual, religious and cultural dimensions of the city, as foreseen in
relevant United Nations resolutions on this matter,

Having considered the report of the Secretary-General,2

1. Reiterates its determination that any actions taken by Israel to impose its
laws, jurisdiction and administration on the Holy City of Jerusalem are illegal and
therefore null and void and have no validity whatsoever;

2. Deplores the transfer by some States of their diplomatic missions to
Jerusalem in violation of Security Council resolution 478 (1980), and calls once
more upon those States to abide by the provisions of the relevant United Nations
resolutions, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations;

3. Stresses that a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the question of
the City of Jerusalem should take into account the legitimate concerns of both the
Palestinian and Israeli sides and should include internationally guaranteed
provisions to ensure the freedom of religion and of conscience of its inhabitants, as
well as permanent, free and unhindered access to the holy places by the people of all
religions and nationalities;

4. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its
sixty-first session on the implementation of the present resolution.
