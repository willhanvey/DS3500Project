 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions and statements by its President on the 
situation in Liberia and West Africa, 

 Welcoming the sustained progress made by the Government of Liberia since 
January 2006, in rebuilding Liberia for the benefit of all Liberians, with the support 
of the international community, 

 Acknowledging the 26 September 2013 decision by the Special Court of Sierra 
Leone to uphold Charles Taylor’s conviction for war crimes and crimes against 
humanity and recognizing the United Kingdom’s willingness to house Mr. Taylor for 
the duration of his sentence, 

 Stressing the need for continued progress on security sector reform in Liberia 
to ensure that Liberia’s military, police, and border security forces are self-
sufficient, capable, competent, and adequately prepared to protect the Liberian 
people as the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) draws down,  

 Underlining that the transparent and effective management of natural 
resources is critical for Liberia’s sustainable peace and security,  

 Recognizing that the Government of Liberia has taken important steps towards 
better management and protection of Liberia’s forests and other natural resources, 
stressing that further steps need to be taken to protect and properly manage Liberia’s 
natural resources transparently, effectively and in a manner that maximizes the 
social and economic benefits to the community and protects the rights of the 
Liberian people, 

 Encouraging the Government of Liberia to continue to make progress through 
effective implementation and enforcement of the National Forestry Reform Law and 
other new legislation related to revenue transparency (the Liberia Extractive 
Industries Transparency Initiative Act) and resolution of land and tenure rights 
(Community Rights Law with respect to Forest Lands and Lands Commission Act), 

 Acknowledging the contributions and continued importance of the United 
Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) in improving security throughout Liberia and 
helping the Government establish its authority throughout the country, particularly 
in population centres, border areas and Liberia’s diamond, gold, timber, and other 
natural resources producing regions,  



S/2013/725  
 

13-61108 2/4 
 

 Encouraging the Government of Liberia to collaborate with UNMIL to 
improve the institutional capacity of the Liberia National Police and customs

investigations and, in this regard, stressing the importance of adopting and 
implementing the Police Act,  

 Taking note of the report of the United Nations Panel of Experts on Liberia 
(S/2013/683),  

 Welcoming the efforts made by the Secretariat to expand and improve the

efforts to meet the conditions of resolution 1521 (2003), welcoming the engagement 
of the Peacebuilding Commission, and encouraging all stakeholders, including 
donors, to support the Government of Liberia in its efforts,  

 Underlining the importance of close cooperation between the Government of 
Liberia and neighbouring countries with regard to effective monitoring and control 
of their borders,  

 Determining that, despite significant progress, the situation in Liberia remains 
fragile and continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security in the
