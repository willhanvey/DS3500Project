21-14745 2/7 

 

 Noting with satisfaction the renewed attention to the catastrophic humanitarian 

consequences and risks associated with nuclear weapons that has been generated by 

the international community since 2010 and the growing awareness that these 

concerns should underpin the need for nuclear disarmament and the urgency of 

achieving and maintaining a nuclear-weapon-free world, and noting with satisfaction 

also the prominence accorded to the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons in 

multilateral disarmament forums,  

 Recalling the discussions held at the Conferences on the Humanitarian Impact 

of Nuclear Weapons, hosted by Norway, on 4 and 5 March 2013, Mexico, on 13 and 

14 February 2014, and Austria, on 8 and 9 December 2014, aimed at understanding 

and developing a greater awareness of the catastrophic consequences of nuclear 

weapon detonations which further reinforce the urgency of nuclear disarmament,  

 Emphasizing the compelling evidence, including that presented at the 

Conferences on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons, that has detailed the 

catastrophic consequences that would result from any nuclear weapon detonation, 

reaching well beyond national borders and also imperilling the achievement of the 

Sustainable Development Goals,3 the lack of capacity of States and international 

organizations to deal with the aftermath and the risk of an occurrence, including an 

occurrence due to an accident, systems failure or human error,  

 Noting the strongly disproportionate and gendered impact of exposure to 

ionizing radiation for women and girls,  

 Welcoming the entry into force on 22 January 2021 of the Treaty on the 

Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, negotiated and adopted by the United Nations 

conference to negotiate a legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons, 

leading towards their total elimination, pursuant to resolution 71/258 of 23 December 

2016,4 

 Welcoming also the commemoration and promotion of 26 September as the 

International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, as established by 

resolution 68/32 of 5 December 2013, 

 Underlining the importance of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation 

education, 

 Reaffirming that nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are 

mutually reinforcing processes requiring urgent irreversible progress on both fronts,  

 Recalling the decisions and the resolution adopted at the 1995 Review and 

Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 

Weapons,5 the basis upon which the Treaty was indefinitely extended, and the Final 

Documents of the 20006 and the 20107 Review Conferences of the Parties to the Treaty

nuclear arsenals, leading to nuclear disarmament, in accordance with commitments 

made under article VI of the Treaty,  

 Reaffirming that transparency, verifiability and irreversibility are cardinal 

principles applying to nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, and 

reaffirming also the commitment of all States parties to the Treaty on the 

Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to applying these principles in relation to the 

implementation of their treaty obligations,  

 Recalling the twenty-fifth anniversary of the opening for signature of the 

Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty8 and the continued vital importance of its 

entry into force to the advancement of nuclear disarmament and nuclear 

non-proliferation objectives, 

 Recalling also that the total elimination of nuclear weapons is the only absolute 

guarantee against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons and the legitimate 

interest of non-nuclear-weapon States in receiving unequivocal and legally binding 

negative security assurances from nuclear-weapon States pending the total 

elimination of nuclear weapons,  

 Reaffirming the conviction that, pending the total elimination of nuclear 

weapons, the establishment and maintenance of nuclear-weapon-free zones enhances 

global and regional peace and security, strengthens the nuclear non-proliferation 

regime and contributes towards realizing the objectives of nuclear disarmament, and 

welcoming the Conferences of States Parties and Signatories to Treaties that Establish 

Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones and Mongolia, 

 Urging States to continue to make real progress towards strengthening all 

existing nuclear-weapon-free zones, inter alia, through the ratification of existing 

treaties and relevant protocols and the withdrawal or revision of any reservations or 

interpretative declarations contrary to the object and purpose of the treaties 

establishing such zones, 

 Recalling the encouragement expressed at the 2010 Review Conference for the 

establishment of further nuclear-weapon-free zones, on the basis of arrangements 

freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned, reaffirming the expectation 

that this will be followed by concerted international efforts to create such zones in 

areas where they do not currently exist, especially in the Middle East, in this context 

noting with deep disappointment the non-fulfilment of the agreement at the 2010 

Review Conference on practical steps to fully implement the 1995 resolution on the 

Middle East, and disappointed that no agreement could be reached at the 2015 Review 

Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 

on this issue, 

 Recalling also its decision 73/546 of 22 December 2018, in which it decided to 

entrust to the Secretary-General the convening of a conference aimed at elaborating 

a treaty on the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all 

other weapons of mass destruction, on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at by 

the States of the region, and encouraged by the outcomes of the first session of the 

conference, which was successfully convened in 2019, 

 Deeply disappointed at the continued absence of progress towards multilateral 

nuclear disarmament at the Conference on Disarmament, which has been unable for 

the past 25 years to agree upon and implement a programme of work, and 

disappointed that the Disarmament Commission has not produced a substantive 

outcome on nuclear disarmament since 1999,

21-14745 4/7 

 

 Deeply regretting the lack of any substantive outcome of the 2015 Review 

Conference, as it missed an opportunity to strengthen the Treaty on the 

Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, enhance progress towards its full 

implementation and universality and monitor the implementation of commitments 

made and actions agreed upon at the 1995, 2000 and 2010 Review Conferences, and 

deeply concerned about the impact of this failure on the Treaty and the balance 

between its three pillars, 

 Noting with serious concern the rising tensions in international relations and the 

increased prominence being given by some States to nuclear weapons in their security 

doctrines, as well as the extensive modernization programmes under way, all of which 

contribute to the erosion of the disarmament and non-proliferation regime, 

 Noting with regret that, owing to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 

pandemic, the 2020 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the 

Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons had to be postponed, emphasizing the 

importance of holding a constructive, comprehensive and successful meeting that 

results in a substantive outcome at the 2020 Review Conference, urging all Member 

States to step up their efforts in this regard, and emphasizing also the vital importance 

of ensuring that the 2020 Review Conference contributes to the strengthening of the 

Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and making progress towards 

achieving its full implementation and universality, and monitors the implementation 

of commitments made and actions agreed upon at the 1995, 2000 and 2010 Review 

Conferences, 

 Welcoming that the Russian Federation and the United States of America have 

agreed on a five-year extension, to 4 February 2026, of the Treaty on Measures for 

the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, while 

re-emphasizing the encouragement of the 2000 and 2010 Review Conferences to both 

States to continue discussions on follow-on measures in order to achieve deeper 

reductions in their nuclear arsenals, and urging in this regard both States to conclude 

negotiations on a successor agreement as soon as possible,  

 Welcoming also the recent reaffirmations of the historic principle that “a nuclear 

war cannot be won and must never be fought”,  

 Underlining the importance of multilateralism in relation to nuclear 

disarmament, while recognizing the value of unilateral, bilateral and regional 

initiatives and the importance of compliance with the terms of these initiatives,  

 1. Reiterates that each article of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 

Nuclear Weapons is binding on the States parties at all times and in all circumstances 

and that all States parties should be held fully accountable with respect to strict 

compliance with their obligations under the Treaty, and calls upon all States parties 

to comply fully with all decisions, resolutions and commitments made at the 1995, 

2000 and 2010 Review Conferences; 

 2. Also reiterates the deep concern expressed by the 2010 Review 

Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 

at the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons, and the 

need for all States at all times to comply with applicable international law, including 

international humanitarian law; 

 3. Acknowledges the evidence presented at the Conferences on the 

Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons, and calls upon Member States, in their 

relevant decisions and actions, to give due prominence to the humanitarian 

imperatives that underpin nuclear disarmament and to the urgency of achieving this 

goal; 



 
A/C.1/76/L.44 

 

5/7 21-14745 

 

 4. Recalls the reaffirmation of the continued validity of the practical steps 

agreed to in the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the 

Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,9 including the specific 

reaffirmation of the unequivocal undertaking of the nuclear-weapon States to 

accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear 

disarmament, to which all States parties are committed under article VI of the Treaty, 

recalls the commitment of the nuclear-weapon States to accelerating concrete 

progress on the steps leading to nuclear disarmament, and calls upon the nuclear-

weapon States to take all steps necessary to accelerate the fulfilment of their 

commitments; 

 5. Calls upon the nuclear-weapon States to fulfil their commitment to 

undertaking further efforts to reduce and ultimately eliminate all types of nuclear 

weapons, deployed and non-deployed, including through unilateral, bilateral, regional 

and multilateral measures; 

 6. Urges all States possessing nuclear weapons to decrease the operational 

readiness of nuclear-weapon systems in a verifiable and transparent manner with a 

view to ensuring that all nuclear weapons are removed from high alert status;  

 7. Encourages the nuclear-weapon States to make concrete reductions in the 

role and significance of nuclear weapons in all military and security concepts, 

doctrines and policies, pending their total elimination;  

 8. Encourages all States that are part of regional alliances that include 

nuclear-weapon States to diminish the role of nuclear weapons in their collective 

security doctrines, pending their total elimination;  

 9. Underlines the recognition by States parties to the Treaty on the 

Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of the legitimate interest of non-nuclear-

weapon States in the constraining by the nuclear-weapon States of the development 

and qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons and their ending the development of 

advanced new types of nuclear weapons, and calls upon the nuclear-weapon States to 

take steps in this regard; 

 10. Notes with concern recent policy statements by nuclear-weapon States 

relating to the modernization of their nuclear weapon programmes, which undermine 

their commitments to nuclear disarmament and increase the risk of the use of nuclear 

weapons and the potential for a new arms race;  

 11. Encourages further steps by all nuclear-weapon States, in accordance with 

the previous obligations and commitments on nuclear disarmament, to ensure the 

irreversible removal of all fissile material designated by each nuclear-weapon State 

as no longer required for military purposes, and calls upon all States to support, within 

the context of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the development of 

appropriate nuclear disarmament verification capabilities and legally binding 

verification arrangements, thereby ensuring that such material remains permanently 

outside military programmes in a verifiable manner;  

 12. Calls upon all States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 

Nuclear Weapons to work towards the full implementation of the resolution on the 

Middle East adopted at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to 

the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which is inextricably linked 

to the indefinite extension of the Treaty, and expresses disappointment and deep 

concern at the lack of a substantive outcome of the 2015 Review Conference of the
