2014, as well as ongoing settlement activities and construction of the wall, the 

internal forced displacement of civilians, the imposition of collective punishment 

measures, particularly against the civilian population in the Gaza Strip, where 

continuing severe restrictions on movement amount to a blockade, and the detention 

and imprisonment of thousands of Palestinians,  

 Gravely concerned also about all acts of violence, intimidation and 

provocation by Israeli settlers against Palestinian civilians and properties, including 

homes, mosques, churches and agricultural lands,

violations and grave breaches of international humanitarian law committed during the

 Having considered the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli 

Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of
