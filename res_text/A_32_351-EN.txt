HI. RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SPECIAL POLITICAL COlI,JUTTEE

19. The Special Political Committee recommends to the General Assembly the
adoption of the following draft resolutions:

United Nations Relief and Works Agency fo~
Palestine Refugees in the Near East

A

Assistance to Palestine refugees

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolution 31/15 A of 23 November 1976 and all previous
resolutions referred to therein, including resolution 194 (Ill) of 11 December 1948,

Taking note of the annual report of the Commissioner-General of the United
Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, covering
the period from 1 July 1976 to 30 June 1977, £!

1. Notes with deep regret that repatriation or compensation of the refugees
as provided for in paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (Ill) has not
been effected, that no substantial progress has been made in the programme
endorsed by the Assembly in paragraph 2 of resolution 513 (VI) of 26 January 1952
for the reintegration of refugees either by repatriation or resettlement and that,
therefore, the situation of the refugees continues to be a matter of serious
concern;

2. Expresses its sincere appreciation to Sir John Rennie, who retired this
year as Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for
Palestine Refugees in the Near East, for his efficient administration of the Agency
and for his dedicated service to the welfare of the refugees during the past nine
years;

3. Expresses its thanks to the Commissioner-General and to the staff of the
United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East for
their continued dedicated and effective efforts under difficult circumstances to
provide essential services for the Palestine refugees, recognizing that the Agency
is doing all it can within the limits of available resources. and also expresses
thanks to the specialized agencies and private organizations'for their valuable
work in assistine the refugees;

implementation of paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (Ill) 11 and
requests the Commission to exert continued efforts towards the implementation of
that paragraph and to report as appropriate, but no later than 1 October 1978;

5. Directs attention to the continuing seriousness of the financial position
of the United NationS-Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near
East, as outlined in the report of the Commissioner-General;

6. Notes with profound concern that, despite the cowBendable and successful
efforts of the Commissioner-General to collect additional contributions, this
increased level of income to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for
Palestine Refugees in the Near East is still insufficient to cover essential budget
re~uirements in the present year, and that, at presently foreseen levels of giving,
deficits will recur each year;

7. Calls upon all Governments as a matter of urgency to make the most
generous efforts possible to meet the anticipated needs of the United Nations Relief
and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, particularly in the light
of the budgetary deficit projected in the report of the Commissioner-General, and
therefore urges non-contributing Governments to contribute regularly and
contributing Governments to consider increasing their regular contributions;

8. Decides to extend until 30 June 1981, without prejudice to the provisions
of paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (Ill), the mandate of the United
Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.
