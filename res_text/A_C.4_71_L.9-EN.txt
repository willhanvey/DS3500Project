population of 5.3 million refugees whose situation has become extremely precarious 

and in providing a crucial measure of stability in the region,  

 Deeply concerned about the extremely critical financial situation of the 

Agency, caused by the structural underfunding of the Agency, as well as by rising 

needs and expenditures resulting from the deterioration of the socioeconomic and 

humanitarian conditions and the conflicts and rising instability in the region and 

their significant negative impact on the ability of the Agency to deliver essential 

services to the Palestine refugees, including its emergency, recovery, reconstruction 

and development programmes in all fields of operation,  

 Taking note of the update to the special report of 3 August 2015 of the 

Commissioner-General, submitted pursuant to paragraph 21 of General Assembly 

resolution 302 (IV) and conveyed by the Secretary-General on 15 September 2016

Agency and the negative implications for the continued delivery of core Agency 

programmes to the Palestine refugees in all fields of operation,

to mobilize resources, including through partnerships with international financial 

institutions, the private sector and civil society, 

 Commending the Agency for the measures taken to address the financial crisis, 

including internal measures to contain costs, and expressing profound concern that, 

despite stringent efficiency measures and controls on expenditures, the Agency’s 

programme budget, which is funded primarily by voluntary contributions from 

Member States and intergovernmental organizations, faces persistent shortfalls that 

are increasingly threatening the delivery of the Agency’s core programmes of 

assistance to the Palestine refugees, 

 Stressing the need to support the Agency’s capacity to uphold its mandate and 

to avert the serious humanitarian, political and security risks that would result from 

any interruption or suspension of its vital work,  

 Recognizing that the recurring and growing financial shortfalls directly 

affecting the sustainability of the Agency’s operations need to be remedied by 

examining new funding modalities designed to put the Agency on a stable financial 

footing to enable it to effectively carry out its core programmes in accordance with 

its mandate and commensurate with humanitarian needs,

others,  

 Gravely concerned about the extremely difficult socioeconomic conditions 

being faced by the Palestine refugees in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 

including East Jerusalem, particularly in the refugee camps in the Gaza Strip, as a 

result of the recurrent military operations, continuing prolonged Israeli closures, the 

construction of settlements and the wall, and the severe economic and movement 

restrictions that in effect amount to a blockade, which have deepened 

unemployment and poverty rates among the refugees, with potentially lasti ng, long-

term negative effects, while taking note of developments with regard to the situation
