 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling all its previous resolutions on the comprehensive follow-up to the 

World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related 

Intolerance and the effective implementation of the Durban Declaration and 

Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference,
1
 and in this regard 

underlining the imperative need for their full and effective implementation,  

 Stressing that the outcome of the World Conference against Racism, Racial 

Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance has the same status as the 

outcomes of all the major United Nations conferences, summits and special sessions 

in the human rights and social fields, and that the Durban Declaration and 

Programme of Action remains a solid basis and the only instructive outco me of the 

World Conference, which prescribes comprehensive measures for combating all the 

scourges of racism and adequate remedies for victims,  

 Recalling the three Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial 

Discrimination previously declared by the General Assembly, and regretting that the 

Programmes of Action for those Decades were not fully implemented and that their 

objectives are yet to be attained,

races, 

 Underlining the intensity, magnitude and organized nature of slavery and the 

slave trade, including the transatlantic slave trade, and the associated historical 

injustices, as well as the untold suffering caused by colonialism and apartheid, and 

that Africans and people of African descent, Asians and people of Asian descent and 

indigenous peoples continue to be victims of the cascading effects of those legacies,

continue to be victims of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 

intolerance, including their contemporary forms and manifestations, some of which

provisions of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and to make 

appropriate recommendations thereon, and in this regard underlining the role played 

and still to be played by those independent eminent experts in mobilizing global 

political will for concrete action for the total elimination of all the scourges of 

racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,  

 Underlining the primacy of the political will, international cooperation and 

adequate funding at the national, regional and international levels needed to address 

all forms and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 

related intolerance for the successful implementation of the Durban Declaration and 

Programme of Action, 

 Recalling its resolution 2142 (XXI) of 26 October 1966, in which it 

proclaimed 21 March as the International Day for the Elimination of Racial 

Discrimination, 

 Recalling also its resolution 62/122 of 17 December 2007, in which it 

designated 25 March as an annual International Day of Remembrance of the Victims 

of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade,  

 Recalling further the suffering of the victims of racism, racial discrimination, 

xenophobia and related intolerance, and the need to honour their memory,  

 Noting that 2016 will mark the fifteenth anniversary of the Durban Declaration 

and Programme of Action, and looking forward to its commemoration,
