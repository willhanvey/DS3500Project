 Welcoming also the report of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights in Myanmar and the observations contained therein,8 and recalling his visit to 
the country on 3 and 4 July 2009, and the visits of his Special Adviser on Myanmar 
from 31 January to 3 February and on 26 and 27 June 2009, respectively, while

past year for the purpose of the good offices mission, 

 Welcoming further the reports of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in Myanmar and urging the implementation of the recommendations 
contained therein9 and those in previous reports, while regretting that a request by

Myanmar, 

 Deeply concerned that the urgent calls contained in the above-mentioned 
resolutions, as well as the statements of other United Nations bodies concerning the

particular in this respect the restrictions imposed by the electoral laws as enacted 
and implemented by the Government, including those placed on the registration of 
voters, parties and candidates, as well as the detention of political activists, the 
restrictions on free reporting and on freedom of assembly, the limited access to 
media, funding and campaigning possibilities, the reported incidents of official 
intimidation, the cancellation of elections in certain ethnic areas, and the lack of 
independence of the electoral commission, and expressing serious concern about 
reports of fraud, including through advance voting arrangements,

future;

Democracy, U Hkun Htun Oo, the leader of the 88 Generation Students Group,

disappearance and to desist from further politically motivated arrests; 

 4. Reaffirms the essential importance of a genuine process of dialogue and

meaningful dialogue with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and calls on the new

dialogue with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all other concerned parties, civil society 
groups and ethnic groups, and to permit them to consult freely among each other 
and with other domestic stakeholders;

transparent and inclusive elections and refused to allow international election 
observers and independent foreign or local journalists to freely monitor or report on 
the voting, and calls on the Government to begin an inclusive post-election phase, 
including through meaningful dialogue and the participation of representatives of all 
groups in the political life of the country, within the framework of a transition to a 
civilian, legitimate and accountable system of government, based on the rule of law 
and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; 

 6. Strongly calls upon the Government of Myanmar to lift restrictions on 
the freedom of assembly, association, movement and freedom of expression,

violations, and to bring to justice those responsible in order to end impunity for 
violations of human rights, and, regretting that previous calls to that effect have not 
been heeded, calls on the Government to do so as a matter of priority and, if 
necessary, drawing on the assistance of the United Nations;

inclusive and comprehensive review of compliance of the Constitution and all

A/C.3/65/L.48/Rev.1  
 

10-64030 4 
 

while recalling once more that the procedures established for the drafting of the 
Constitution resulted in a de facto exclusion of opposition groups from the process;

prisons far from their families where they cannot receive food and medicine;

population in all parts of the country and for all concerned to respect existing 
ceasefire agreements;

of systematic forced displacement of large numbers of persons within their country

to grant citizenship to the Rohingya ethnic minority;

Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, adequate

rights law and international humanitarian law and to hold them accountable for any 
violations thereof; 

 16. Calls upon the Government of Myanmar to consider ratifying and 
acceding to remaining international human rights treaties, which would enable a

understanding between the International Labour Organization and the Government
