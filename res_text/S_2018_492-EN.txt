 The Security Council,  

 Recalling all relevant Security Council resolutions, including resolutions 1296 

(2000), 1894 (2009), 2175 (2014), and 2286 (2016) and its Presidential Statement of 

9 August 2017 (S/PRST/2017/14),  

 Deeply concerned about the level of global humanitarian needs and the threat of 

famine presently facing millions of people in armed conflicts, as well as about the 

number of undernourished people in the world which, after decades of decreasing, 

increased over the last two years, with the majority of food insecure people and 

seventy-five percent of all stunted children under the age of five living in countries 

affected by armed conflict, amounting to 74 million people facing crisis food 

insecurity or worse in situations of armed conflict,  

 Noting the devastating impact on civilians of ongoing armed conflict and related 

violence, and emphasising with deep concern that ongoing armed conflicts and 

violence have devastating humanitarian consequences, often hindering an effective 

humanitarian response, and are therefore a major cause of the current risk of famine,  

 Expressing concern over the growing number of armed conflicts in different 

geographic areas all over the globe, and underlining the urgent need for redoubled 

efforts for their prevention and resolution, addressing where pertinent the regional 

dimensions of armed conflicts with specific emphasis on regional diplomacy and 

arrangements,  

 Reiterating its commitment to pursue all possible avenues to prevent and end 

armed conflicts, including through addressing their underlying root causes in an 

inclusive, integrated and sustainable manner,  

 Recognising the need to break the vicious cycle between armed conflict and 

food insecurity,  

 Reiterating its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace 

and security and, in this connection, its commitment to address conflict -induced food 

insecurity, including famine, in situations of armed conflict,  

 Reaffirming the full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States 

in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations,  

 Recognising that armed conflict impacts on food security can be direct, such as 

displacement from land, livestock grazing areas, and fishing grounds or destruction

of food stocks and agricultural assets, or indirect, such as disruptions to food systems 

and markets, leading to increased food prices or decreased household purchasing 

power, or decreased access to supplies that are necessary for food preparation, 

including water and fuel,  

 Noting with deep concern the serious humanitarian threat, posed to civilians by 

landmines, explosive remnants of war and improvised explosive devices in affected 

countries, which has serious and lasting social and economic consequences for the 

populations of such countries and their agricultural activities, as well as of personnel 

participating in law enforcement, humanitarian, peacekeeping, rehabilitation and 

clearance programmes and operations,  

 Stressing the particular impact that armed conflict has on women, children, 

including as refugees and internally displaced persons, and other  civilians who may 

have specific vulnerabilities including persons with disabilities and older persons, and 

stressing the protection and assistance needs of all affected civilian populations,  

 Reaffirming the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of 

conflicts and in peacebuilding, and stressing the importance of their equal 

participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of 

peace and security, and the need to increase their role in decision-making with regard 

to conflict prevention and resolution,  

 Recalling the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Additional Protocols of 

1977, and the obligation of High Contracting Parties and parties to armed conflict to 

respect and ensure respect for international humanitarian law in all circumstances,  

 Underlining that using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare may 

constitute a war crime,  

 Stressing that responding effectively to humanitarian needs in armed conflict, 

including the threat of conflict-induced famine and food insecurity in situations of 

armed conflict, requires respect for international humanitarian law by all parties to 

conflict, underlining the parties’ obligations related to protecting civilians and 

civilian objects, meeting the basic needs of the civilian population within their 

territory or under their effective control, and allowing and facilitating the rapid and 

unimpeded passage of impartial humanitarian relief to all those in need,  

 Recalling its intention to mandate United Nations peacekeeping and other 

relevant missions, where appropriate, to assist in creating conditions conducive to 

safe, timely and unimpeded humanitarian assistance,  

 Demanding that all parties to armed conflicts fully comply with their obligations 

under international law, including international human rights law, as applicable, and 

international humanitarian law, in particular their obligations under the Geneva 

Conventions of 1949 and the obligations applicable to them under the Additional 

Protocols thereto of 1977 and 2005, to ensure the respect and protection of all medical 

personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, their 

means of transport and equipment, as well as hospitals and other medical facilities,  

 Reaffirming the obligation of all parties to an armed conflict to comply with 

international humanitarian law, in particular their obligations under the Geneva 

Conventions of 1949 and the obligations applicable to them under the Additional 

Protocols thereto of 1977, to ensure the respect and protection of all humanitarian 

personnel and United Nations and associated personnel, as well as with the rules and 

principles of international human rights law and refugee law,  

 Reaffirming the need for all parties to armed conflict to respect the humanitarian 

principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence in the provision of 

humanitarian assistance, including medical assistance, and reaffirming also the need 



 
S/2018/492 

 

3/4 18-08385 

 

for all actors engaged in the provision of such assistance in situations of armed 

conflict to promote and fully adhere to these principles,  

 Stressing that the fight against impunity and to ensure accountability for 

genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other egregious crimes has been 

strengthened through the work on and prosecution of these crimes in the national and 

international criminal justice system, ad hoc and mixed tribunals as well as 

specialized chambers in national tribunals,  

 Reaffirming the primary responsibility of States to protect the population 

throughout their whole territory,  

 1. Recalls the link between armed conflict and violence and conflict-induced 

food insecurity and the threat of famine, and calls on all parties to armed conflict to 

comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law regarding 

respecting and protecting civilians and taking constant care to spare civilian objects, 

including objects necessary for food production and distribution such as farms, 

markets, water systems, mills, food processing and storage sites, and hubs and means 

for food transportation, and refraining from attacking, destroying, removing or 

rendering useless objects that are indispensable to the survival of the civilian 

population, such as foodstuffs, crops, livestock, agricultural assets , drinking water 

installations and supplies, and irrigation works, and respecting and protecting 

humanitarian personnel and consignments used for humanitarian relief operations;  

 2. Stresses in this regard that armed conflict, violations of international 

humanitarian law and international human rights law, and food insecurity can be 

drivers of forced displacement, and, conversely, forced displacement in countries in 

armed conflict can have a devastating impact on agricultural production and 

livelihoods, recalls the relevant prohibition on the forced displacement of civilians in 

armed conflict, and stresses the importance of fully complying with international 

humanitarian law and other applicable international law in this context;  

 3. Stresses the need for humanitarian assistance to be gender- and age-

sensitive, and to remain responsive to the different needs of the population, ensuring 

that these needs are integrated in the humanitarian response;  

 4. Calls on all parties to armed conflict to comply with their obligations 

under international humanitarian law, and underlines the importance of safe and 

unimpeded access of humanitarian personnel to civilians in armed conflicts, calls 

upon all parties concerned, including neighbouring States, to cooperate fully with the 

United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator and United Nations agencies in providing 

such access, invites States and the Secretary-General to bring to its attention 

information regarding the unlawful denial of such access in violation of  international 

law, where such denial may constitute a threat to international peace and security, 

and, in this regard, expresses its willingness to consider such information and, when 

necessary, to adopt appropriate steps;  

 5. Strongly condemns the use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare 

in a number of conflict situations and prohibited by international humanitarian law;  

 6. Strongly condemns the unlawful denial of humanitarian access and 

depriving civilians of objects indispensable to their survival, including wilfully 

impeding relief supply and access for responses to conflict -induced food insecurity 

in situations of armed conflict, which may constitute a violation of international 

humanitarian law;  

 7. Urges all parties to protect civilian infrastructure which is critical to the 

delivery of humanitarian aid and to ensure the proper functioning of food systems and 

markets in situations of armed conflict;  



S/2018/492 
 

 

18-08385 4/4 

 

 8. Urges those with influence over parties to armed conflict to remind the 

latter of their obligation to comply with international humanitarian law;  

 9. Recalls that the Council has adopted and can consider to adopt sanction 

measures, where appropriate and in line with existing practice, that can be applied to 

individuals or entities obstructing the delivery of humanitarian assistance, or access 

to, or distribution of, humanitarian assistance;  

 10. Strongly urges States to conduct, in an independent manner, full, prompt, 

impartial and effective investigations within their jurisdiction in to violations of 

international humanitarian law related to the use of starvation of civilians as a method 

of warfare, including the unlawful denial of humanitarian assistance to the civilian 

population in armed conflict, and, where appropriate, to take act ion against those 

responsible in accordance with domestic and international law, with a view to 

reinforcing preventive measures, ensuring accountability and addressing the 

grievances of victims;  

 11. Requests the Secretary-General to continue to provide information on the 

humanitarian situation and response, including on the risk of famine and food 

insecurity in countries with armed conflict, as part of his regular reporting on country -

specific situations;  

 12. Further requests the Secretary-General to report swiftly to the Council 

when the risk of conflict-induced famine and wide-spread food insecurity in armed 

conflict contexts occurs, and expresses its intention to give its full attention to such 

information provided by the Secretary-General when those situations are brought to 

its attention;  

 13. Further requests the Secretary-General to brief the Security Council every 

twelve months on the implementation of this resolution within his annual briefing on 

the protection of civilians.
