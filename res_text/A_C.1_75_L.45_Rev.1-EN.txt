 The General Assembly, 

 Reaffirming the applicability of international law, including the Charter of the 

United Nations, to activities in outer space and the right of all States to explore and 

use outer space without discrimination of any kind, on a basis of equality and in 

accordance with such law, 

 Recalling its resolutions 68/50 of 5 December 2013 and 74/32 of 12 December 

2019, 

 Emphasizing the importance of maintaining outer space as a peaceful, safe, 

stable, secure and sustainable environment for the benefit of all and the significant 

contribution of outer space activities to social, economic, scientific and technological 

development, as well as to international peace and security,  

 Reaffirming the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the 

Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, 1 

and the obligations for States parties to the Treaty to explore and use outer space for 

the benefit and in the interests of all countries, and to be guided by the principle of 

cooperation and mutual assistance,  

 Welcoming the recent adoption by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer 

Space at its sixty-second session of the Guidelines for the Long-Term Sustainability

of Outer Space Activities,2 the implementation of which may have a positive effect 

on international peace and security,  

 Urging all States, when developing, planning and executing their space 

activities, to remain committed to the peaceful exploration and use of outer space and 

to refrain from conducting activities contrary to their obligations under international 

law, including those that could threaten the ability of all States to freely use and 

explore outer space, now and in the future, 

 Stressing that the creation of long-lived orbital debris arising from the deliberate 

destruction of space systems increases the risk of in-orbit collisions and the potential 

for misunderstanding and miscalculations that could lead to conflict,  

 Reaffirming that the prevention of an arms race in outer space would avert a 

grave danger for international peace and security,  

 Recalling the primary role of the Conference on Disarmament on questions 

relating to the prevention of an arms race in outer space in all its aspects, including 

the weaponization of outer space and threats from capabilities on Earth, and the 

relevant responsibilities of the First Committee of the General Assembly and the 

Disarmament Commission, 

 Noting the rapid advances of technologies in space systems, the use of which 

could have positive or negative effects on international security, and seeking to 

understand how States behave in the light of these developments,  

 Recognizing that efforts to prevent an arms race and to prevent conflic t from 

beginning in or extending into outer space must include consideration of the use of 

all potential technologies and means, whether on Earth or in outer space,  

 Stressing that uses of these technologies and means for purposes inconsistent 

with the objectives of maintaining international stability and security, including 

against signals for operators and users and the terrestrial infrastructure supporting 

space systems, can lead to the perception of threats and can have destabilizing effects 

on peace and security on Earth, and that such threats already exist in outer space and 

on Earth, 

 Recognizing the need for States to seek to avoid and mitigate the potential 

impact on peace and security arising from accidents, miscommunication or a lack of 

transparency, which could lead to miscalculations and the escalation of tensions and 

contribute to an arms race, 

 Cognizant of the challenges of effectively verifying the capabilities of space 

objects, which can have both civilian and military applications, interpre ting their 

behaviour or determining whether the systems will be used for purposes inconsistent 

with the objectives of maintaining international security and stability, while reaffirming 

that verification is one of the essential components of all arms control instruments, 

 Noting the need for all States to work together to reduce threats to space systems 

through the further development and implementation of norms, rules and principles of 

responsible behaviours with the aim of maintaining a peaceful, safe, stable, secure and 

sustainable outer space environment, which might, as appropriate and without 

prejudice, contribute to further consideration of legally binding instruments in this area,  

 Recognizing the importance of the full involvement and equal participation of 

women and men in discussions on reducing space threats through responsible 

behaviours and the need to assess the possible differentiated impacts of such threats,

international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, and urges Member 

States to take this into account when formulating their space policies;  

 2. Encourages those States that have not yet become parties to the 

international treaties governing the exploration and use of outer space to give 

consideration to ratifying or acceding to those treaties in accordance with their 

national law, as well as incorporating them into their national legislation; 

 3. Expresses the desire that all Member States reach a common understanding 

of how best to act to reduce threats to space systems in order to maintain outer space

communication for the management of perceptions of threat;  

 4. Invites States members and observers of the Conference on Disarmament

security policies, strategies or doctrines, on a voluntary basis, in accordance with and 

in support of the mandates of those bodies;  

 5. Encourages Member States to study existing and potential threats and 

security risks to space systems, including those arising from actions, activities or 

systems in outer space or on Earth, characterize actions and activities that could be 

considered responsible, irresponsible or threatening and their potential impact  on 

international security, and share their ideas on the further development and 

implementation of norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours and on the 

reduction of the risks of misunderstanding and miscalculations with respect to outer 

space; 

 6. Requests the Secretary-General, within existing resources, to seek the 

views of Member States on the issues referred to in the foregoing paragraph and to 

submit a substantive report, with an annex containing these views, to the General 

Assembly at its seventy-sixth session, for further discussion by Member States;  

 7. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-sixth session, 

under the item entitled “Prevention of an arms race in outer space”, a sub-item 

entitled, “Reducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of responsible 

behaviours”.
