 Recalling also that, at the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna

 Expressing grave concern that, in some countries, the situation of children is 

adversely affected by unilateral measures not in accordance with international law 

and the Charter that create obstacles to trade relations among States, impede the full 

realization of social and economic development and hinder the well-being of the 

population in the affected countries, with particular consequences for women, 

children, including adolescents, the elderly and persons with disabilities,  

 Deeply concerned that, despite the recommendations adopted on this question 

by the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council, the Commission on Human 

Rights and recent major United Nations conferences, and contrary to general 

international law and the Charter, unilateral coercive measures continue to be 

promulgated and implemented, with all their negative implications for the social 

humanitarian activities and economic and social development of developing 

countries, including their extraterritorial effects, thereby creating additional obstacles 

to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals under the 

jurisdiction of other States, 

 Bearing in mind all the extraterritorial effects of any unilateral legislative, 

administrative and economic measures, policies and practices of a coercive nature 

against the development process and the enhancement of human rights in developing 

countries, which create obstacles to the full realization of all human rights,  

 Reaffirming that unilateral coercive measures are a major obstacle to the 

implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development 15  and the 2030 

Agenda for Sustainable Development,  

 Recalling article 1, paragraph 2, common to the International Covenant on Civil 

and Political Rights 16  and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 

Cultural Rights,16 which provides, inter alia, that in no case may a people be deprived 

of its own means of subsistence,  

 Noting the continuing efforts of the open-ended Working Group on the Right to 

Development of the Human Rights Council, and reaffirming in particular its criteria, 

according to which unilateral coercive measures are one of the obstacles to the 

implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development,  

 1. Urges all States to cease adopting or implementing any unilateral measures 

not in accordance with international law, international humanitarian law, the Charter 

of the United Nations and the norms and principles governing peaceful relations 

among States, in particular those of a coercive nature, with all their extraterritorial 

effects, which create obstacles to trade relations among States, thus impeding the full 

realization of the rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 17 and 

other international human rights instruments, in particular the right of individuals and 

peoples to development; 

 2. Strongly urges States to refrain from promulgating and applying any 

unilateral economic, financial or trade measures not in accordance with international 

law and the Charter that impede the full achievement of sustainable economic and 

social development, particularly in developing countries;  

 3. Condemns the inclusion of Member States in unilateral lists under false 

pretexts, which are contrary to international law and the Charter, including false 

allegations of terrorism sponsorship, considering such lists as instruments for political 

or economic pressure against Member States, particularly developing countries;

 4. Urges all States not to adopt any unilateral measures not in accordance 

with international law and the Charter that impede the full achievement of economic 

and social development by the population of the affected countries, in particular 

children and women, that hinder their well-being and that create obstacles to the full 

enjoyment of their human rights, including the right of everyone to a standard of 

living adequate for his or her health and well-being and his or her right to food, 

medical care and education and the necessary social services, as well as to ensure that 

food and medicine are not used as tools for political pressure; 

 5. Strongly objects to the extraterritorial nature of those measures which, in 

addition, threaten the sovereignty of States, and in this context calls upon all Member 

States neither to recognize those measures nor to apply them, as well as to take 

administrative or legislative measures, as appropriate, to counteract the 

extraterritorial applications or effects of unilateral coercive measures;  

 6. Condemns the continuing unilateral application and enforcement by 

certain Powers of unilateral coercive measures, and rejects those measures, with all 

their extraterritorial effects, as being tools for political or economic pressure against 

any country, in particular against developing countries, adopted with a view to 

preventing those countries from exercising their right to decide, of their own free will, 

their own political, economic and social systems, and because of the negative effects 

of those measures on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their 

populations, in particular children, women, the elderly and persons with disabilities;  

 7. Expresses grave concern that, in some countries, the situation of children 

is adversely affected by unilateral measures not in accordance with international law 

and the Charter that create obstacles to trade relations among States, impede the full 

realization of social and economic development and hinder the well -being of the 

population in the affected countries, with particular consequences for women, 

children, including adolescents, the elderly and persons with disabilities; 

 8. Reaffirms that essential goods such as food and medicines should not be 

used as tools for political coercion and that under no circumstances should people be 

deprived of their own means of subsistence and development;  

 9. Calls upon Member States that have initiated such measures to abide by 

the principles of international law, the Charter, the declarations of the United Nations 

and world conferences and relevant resolutions and to commit themselves to their 

obligations and responsibilities arising from the international human rights 

instruments to which they are parties by revoking such measures at the earliest 

possible time; 

 10. Reaffirms, in this context, the right of all peoples to self-determination, by 

virtue of which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their 

economic, social and cultural development;  

 11. Recalls that, according to the Declaration on Principles of International 

Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with 

the Charter of the United Nations, contained in the annex to General Assembly 

resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970, and the relevant principles and provisions 

contained in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, proc laimed by the 

Assembly in its resolution 3281 (XXIX), in particular article 32 thereof, no State may 

use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to 

coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the e xercise of its 

sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind;  

 12. Rejects all attempts to introduce unilateral coercive measures, and urges 

the Human Rights Council to take fully into account the negative impact of those 

measures, including through the enactment and extraterritorial application of national 



 
A/C.3/74/L.42 

 

5/6 19-18828 

 

laws that are not in conformity with international law, in its task concerning the 

implementation of the right to development;  

 13. Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in 

discharging her functions relating to the promotion, realization and protection of the 

right to development and bearing in mind the continuing impact of unilateral coercive 

measures on the population of developing countries, to give priority to  the present 

resolution in her annual report to the General Assembly;  

 14. Underlines the fact that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major 

obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development 15 and 

the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,18  and in this regard calls upon all 

States to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic coercive measures and the 

extraterritorial application of national laws that run counter to the principles of free 

trade and hamper the development of developing countries, as recognized by the 

open-ended Working Group on the Right to Development of the Human Rights 

Council; 

 15. Recognizes that, in the Declaration of Principles adopted at the first phase 

of the World Summit on the Information Society, held in Geneva from 10 to

unilateral measure not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the 

United Nations in building the information society;  

 16. Reaffirms paragraph 30 of the outcome document of the United Nations 

summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, entitled

economic, financial or trade measures not in accordance with international law and 

the Charter of the United Nations that impede the full achievement of economic and 

social development, particularly in developing countries; 

 17. Recalls the decision of the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 27/21,3
