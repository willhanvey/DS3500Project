 The Security Council, 

 Recalling the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and 

reaffirming the primary responsibility of the Security Council under the Charter of 

the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security,  

 Recalling its previous relevant resolutions and presidential statements 

addressing issues of peacekeeping, and reaffirming the basic principles of 

peacekeeping, such as consent of the parties, impartiality, and non-use of force, 

except in self-defence and defence of the mandate,  

 Stressing that the primacy of politics should be the hallmark of the approach of 

the United Nations to the resolution of conflict, including through mediation, good 

offices, the monitoring of ceasefires, assistance to the implementation of peace 

accords, 

 Underscoring the importance of peacekeeping as one of the most effective tools 

available to the United Nations in the promotion and maintenance of international 

peace and security, reaffirming that lasting peace is neither achieved nor sustained by 

military and technical engagements alone, but through political solutions and strongly 



S/2021/771 
 

 

21-12640 2/6 

 

convinced that this should guide the design and deployment of United Nations peace 

operations, and understanding United Nations peace operations as peacekeeping 

operations and special political missions,  

 Recognising the crucial role peacekeeping plays in creating conditions for 

stability and lasting peace, and the need for United Nations peace operations to have 

integrated strategies that articulate a clear pathway to transition and to achieving 

sustainable peace, and underlining that transitions of United Nations Peace 

Operations are understood as a strategic process which builds towards a 

reconfiguration of the strategy, footprint, and capacity of the United Nations in a way 

that supports peacebuilding objectives and the development of a sustainable peace, in 

a manner that supports and reinforces national ownership, informed by the operational 

context and the national priorities and needs of the host State and its population, and 

that includes engagement with local community and civil society, and, where relevant, 

regional and sub-regional organisations, and other relevant stakeholders, with the full, 

equal and meaningful participation of women and the inclusion of youth and persons 

with disabilities, 

 Reiterating the primary responsibility of States to protect the population 

throughout their territories, recognising that reconfigurations of missions may entail 

increased risks for civilians, in particular for women, youth, children, persons  with 

disabilities, and, where relevant, the need to enhance States’ capacity to protect their 

own civilians, emphasising the importance of security sector reform, poverty 

reduction measures, gender equality, human rights monitoring and reporting, the 

promotion of rule of law and good governance, and the extension of legitimate State 

authority in ensuring the protection of civilians over the longer term and in the 

consolidation of peace and stability, taking note of interlinkages between transitional 

justice, inclusive disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration processes, functional 

child protection services, national small arms and light weapons management, and 

organised crime and anti-corruption measures, for enhancing stability, reaffirming 

that development, peace and security, and human rights are interlinked and mutually 

reinforcing, and recalling further the General Assembly resolution, A/RES/70/1, 

entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”,  

 Recognising that States bear the primary responsibility to respect and ensure the 

human rights of all persons within their territory and subject to their jurisdiction as 

provided for by international law, and acknowledging the important role of those who 

protect and promote human rights, civil society organisations, journalists and other 

media workers in the promotion and protection of human rights,  

 Reaffirming its commitment to addressing the impact of armed conflict on 

women, youth, and children, and recalling its resolution 1325 (2000) on women, 

peace and security, resolution 1265 (1999) on the protection of civilians in armed 

conflict, resolution 2250 on youth, peace and security, resolution 1261 (1999) on 

children and armed conflict, and resolution 2475 (2019) on the disproportionate 

impact of armed conflict and related humanitarian crises on persons with disabilities, 

as well as all subsequent resolutions concerning these agendas,  

 Reaffirming its commitment to include in the mandates of peace operations a 

desired outcome of the implementation of sequenced, mandated tasks and, where 

appropriate, a clear prioritisation of tasks to achieve this outcome, reflecting the need 

to create favourable conditions for sustainable peace, understanding prioritisation as 

the mission focussing on those specific mandated tasks which are based on up-to-date 

conflict analysis and planning and are assessed as responding to the evolving needs 

on the ground, and further understanding sequencing as a logical, flexible 

implementation of the mandate over time, in line with the strategic vision as set out

in the mandate, aligned with the peace and security needs within the host State, 

building towards a consolidation of peace,  

 Recognising that the effective implementation of peacekeeping mandates is the 

responsibility of all stakeholders and is contingent upon several critical factors, 

including well-defined, realistic and achievable mandates, political will, leadership, 

performance and accountability at all levels, adequate resources, policy, planning and 

operational guidelines and training and equipment, and welcoming further 

engagement and dialogue between United Nations, troop and police contributing 

countries, and other relevant stakeholders to improve performance and inform 

decisions regarding mandate design,  

 Reaffirming its belief that United Nations peacekeeping, including mission 

transition processes, is a unique global partnership that draws together the 

contributions and commitments of the entire United Nations system, and reaffirms its 

commitment to strengthening this partnership, including to ensure a coherent, 

integrated, and planned approach to transitions at the earliest possible stage,  

 Noting efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General to mobilise all partners and 

stakeholders in support of more effective United Nations peacekeeping through his 

initiatives “Action for Peacekeeping” and “Action for Peacekeeping +”, which 

highlight the importance of advancing political solutions, strengthening protection of 

civilians, improving the safety and security of peacekeepers, implementing the 

Women, Peace and Security agenda, supporting effective performance and 

accountability, improving peacekeeping partnerships, strengthening the conduct of 

peacekeeping operations and personnel, and strengthening the impact of 

peacekeeping on peacebuilding and sustaining peace,  

 Reaffirming that “sustaining peace” should be broadly understood as a goal and 

a process to build a common vision of a society, ensuring that the needs and human 

rights of all segments of the population are taken into account, which encompasses 

activities, including promotion of justice and accountability, aimed at preventing the 

outbreak, escalation, continuation and recurrence of conflict, addressing root causes, 

assisting parties to conflict to end hostilities, ensuring national reconciliation, and 

moving towards recovery, reconstruction and development, and emphasising that 

sustaining peace is a shared task and responsibility that needs to be fulfilled by the 

government and all other national stakeholders and should flow through all three 

pillars of the United Nations’ engagement at all stages of conflict, and in all its 

dimensions, and needs sustained international attention and assistance, 

 1. Stresses the crucial role peace operations play in the pursuit of sustainable 

political solutions and building peace, and, in this regard, emphasises the need for 

peace operations to engage at the earliest possible stage in integrated planning and 

coordination on transitions with the Resident Coordinators, United Nations Country 

Team, other United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, the host State and other 

national stakeholders including civil society and further emphasises that in order to 

be sustainable, the transition planning process should take into account broad 

challenges, including risks to stability, governance, and the rule of law, as well as the 

political, economic, development, humanitarian, and human rights context; 

 2. Requests the Secretary-General to plan for United Nations peace 

operations transitions which are integrated within the wider country -specific 

transition to peace and to elaborate mission transition strategies which build towards 

the reconfiguration of the strategy, footprint and capacity of the United Nations 

presence, informed by input from stakeholders at all levels, including in close 

consultation with national authorities, the Resident Coordinator and United Nations 

Country Team, local communities and organisations, including those that contribute 

to peacebuilding, with the full, equal, and meaningful participation of women and 



S/2021/771 
 

 

21-12640 4/6 

 

inclusion of youth, regional and sub-regional organisations, as well as relevant 

International Financial Institutions and United Nations funds, programmes and 

agencies, and further requests that these mission strategies clarify roles and 

responsibilities for all relevant United Nations stakeholders as well as, where 

relevant, clear and realistic benchmarks and indicators which measure factors and 

conditions that might impact the reconfiguration in order to ensure a successful and 

durable transition;  

 3. Encourages national governments to develop and implement 

comprehensive national plans, policies, or strategies to protect civilians, which 

include national benchmarks, in advance of peace operations transitions and requests 

the Secretary-General to direct United Nations peace operations to engage with host 

State governments, other United Nations entities, civil society, including women and 

youth, those who protect and promote human rights, International Financial 

Institutions, and all relevant stakeholders to assist, when requested by host state 

governments, in the development, implementation and monitoring of national 

strategies and plans for transition including on the protection of civilians, human 

rights and access to justice, in line with the United Nations peace operations 

transitions strategy;  

 4. Stresses the importance of providing clear, achievable, sequenced, and 

prioritised mandates, where appropriate, based on accurate and reliable information 

on the situation on the ground and a realistic assessment of threats against civilians 

and United Nations personnel, premises and assets, made in consultation with all 

relevant stakeholders, requests the Secretary-General to provide integrated, evidence-

based and data-driven analysis, strategic assessments and frank advice to the Security 

Council to facilitate as necessary a re-evaluation of the mission composition and 

mandate based on realities on the ground, reaffirms the importance of a greater 

awareness in the Security Council of the security, resource, and field support 

implications of its decisions and of transparent reporting on these issues in 

appropriate United Nations fora, stresses the necessity to ensure the execution of tasks 

that contribute to the protection of civilians in the field, and further requests that 

progress in achieving priority tasks laid down in Security Council resolutions be 

measured through clear, realistic and measurable benchmarks;  

 5. Expresses the importance of a United Nations presence appropriately 

configured with necessary capabilities and capacities to provide support to protection 

of civilians efforts during transitions, further expresses its intention, where relevant, 

to consider the appropriate measures through which a mandated, reconfigured United 

Nations presence could provide such support, including through supporting the 

establishment of and training in the use of early warning and rapid response systems, 

deployment of mobile monitoring teams, facilitating local crisis mediation, utilising 

communications and outreach strategies with populations at risk of violence including 

sexual and gender-based violence, advancing conflict prevention, mitigation, and 

reconciliation, including through promoting and supporting inter-communal dialogue 

and community violence reduction, building trust between State authorities and local 

communities, supporting community policing initiatives, or other methods of 

unarmed civilian protection, and recalling the primary responsibility of States to 

protect the population throughout their territories;  

 6. Requests the Secretary-General to ensure that comprehensive gender 

analysis and technical gender expertise are included throughout all stages of mission 

planning, mandate implementation and review and throughout the transition process, 

as well as mainstreaming of a gender perspective, and to ensure the full, equal , and 

meaningful participation of women, and the inclusion of youth, as well as measures 

to safeguard the interests of persons with disabilities, and further requests the 



 
S/2021/771 

 

5/6 21-12640 

 

Secretary-General to ensure that their needs are fully integrated in all prioritised and 

sequenced stages of a mission mandate and mission transitions;  

 7. Requests the Secretary-General to further strengthen coordination between 

United Nations police, justice, and corrections activities, as well as between United 

Nations uniformed components and as appropriate, the relevant host State authorities, 

with a view to supporting States’ ability to provide critical functions in these fields, 

recognises that, in line with host State needs, strengthening the capacity of 

representative, responsive, accountable host State security sector and rule of law 

institutions, which are compliant with applicable international law, is critical for the 

development of a sustainable peace, and further requests the Secretary-General to 

produce a review across relevant peacekeeping missions of the implementation of 

mandates to support the restoration and extension of legitimate state authority and 

security sector reform with a view to identifying lessons learned for transition 

planning, and in his regular reports on relevant peacekeeping operations to the 

Security Council to include information on the challenges, best practices, and lessons 

learned in implementing mandates to support the restoration and extension of 

legitimate state authority and security sector reform with a view to facilitating 

transition planning;  

 8. Emphasises the importance of enhancing the safety and security of 

peacekeepers, in accordance with resolutions 2518 (2020) and other relevant Security 

Council resolutions, including resolution 2589 (2021) on strengthening accountability 

for crimes committed against peacekeepers, and the Action Plan on improving safety 

and security related to the report on “Improving Security of United Nations 

Peacekeepers”, notes the particular risks faced prior to and during a transition, and, 

in this respect, requests the Secretary-General to continue to take all appropriate 

measures to enhance the safety and security of peacekeeping personnel, including 

through the provision of advice based on integrated, evidence-based and data-driven 

analysis, and strategic assessments to the Security Council to facilitate as necessary 

a re-evaluation of safety and security risks and the mission composition and mandate 

based on realities on the ground;  

 9. Calls upon the Secretary-General and field missions to draw on lessons 

learned from transitions in the further development and implementation of relevant 

United Nations transition policies and directives, including the Secretary-General’s 

Planning Directive for the Development of Consistent and Coherent United Nations 

Transition Processes and the Integrated Assessment and Planning Policy, and further 

calls upon the Secretary-General to continue to strengthen planning and management 

of transition processes and to further enhance organisational learning and guidance 

on transitions;  

 10. Acknowledges the importance of strong coordination, coherence and 

cooperation with the Peacebuilding Commission, in accordance with its resolution 

S/RES/2282 (2016), and, in this regard, reaffirms its intention to regularly request, 

deliberate and draw upon the specific, strategic and targeted advice of the 

Peacebuilding Commission, including to assist with the longer-term perspective 

required for peacebuilding and sustaining peace being reflected in the formation, 

review and reconfiguration of peace operations;  

 11. Strongly encourages the Peacebuilding Commission to continue fully 

utilising its role to convene United Nations bodies, Member States, national 

authorities and all other relevant stakeholders including regional and sub -regional 

organisations and international financial institutions to ensure an integrated, strategic, 

coherent, coordinated and gender-responsive approach to peacebuilding and 

sustaining peace and, in particular, to facilitate the development of joint objectives 

and priorities prior to transitions and, in this connection, requests the Secretary-

General to liaise with the Peacebuilding Commission in advance of relevant reporting 

to the Security Council with a view to facilitating the provision of complementary 

and timely advice from the Commission to the Council;  

 12. Recognises the contribution of regional and sub-regional organisations to 

peacebuilding and transitions, and calls upon the Secretary-General to consult 

relevant regional and sub-regional organisations, as appropriate, in the planning and 

execution of transition processes and to ensure that transition plans clearly articulate 

the potential roles of these organisations;  

 13. Recognises that peacebuilding financing remains a critical challenge, takes 

note of the General Assembly decision to convene a high-level meeting in the seventy-

sixth session to advance, explore and consider options for ensuring adequate, 

predictable and sustainable financing for peacebuilding, and reiterates the importance 

of adequately resourcing United Nations peace operations including during mission 

transitions to support the long-term stability and continuity of peacebuilding 

activities;  

 14. Requests the Secretary-General to incorporate comprehensive reporting on 

the status of ongoing transitions of United Nations peacekeeping operations in his
