  Prevention of an arms race in outer space 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recognizing the common interest of all mankind in the exploration and use of 
outer space for peaceful purposes, 

 Reaffirming the will of all States that the exploration and use of outer space, 
including the Moon and other celestial bodies, shall be for peaceful purposes and 
shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interest of all countries, irrespective of 
their degree of economic or scientific development, 

 Reaffirming also the provisions of articles III and IV of the Treaty on 
Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer 
Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies,1 

 Recalling the obligation of all States to observe the provisions of the Charter 
of the United Nations regarding the use or threat of use of force in their 
international relations, including in their space activities, 

 Reaffirming paragraph 80 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session 
of the General Assembly,2 in which it is stated that in order to prevent an arms race 
in outer space, further measures should be taken and appropriate international 
negotiations held in accordance with the spirit of the Treaty, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions on this issue, and taking note of the 
proposals submitted to the General Assembly at its tenth special session and at its

regular sessions, and of the recommendations made to the competent organs of the 
United Nations and to the Conference on Disarmament, 

 Recognizing that prevention of an arms race in outer space would avert a grave 
danger for international peace and security, 

 Emphasizing the paramount importance of strict compliance with existing arms 
limitation and disarmament agreements relevant to outer space, including bilateral 
agreements, and with the existing legal regime concerning the use of outer space, 

 Considering that wide participation in the legal regime applicable to outer 
space could contribute to enhancing its effectiveness, 

 Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in 
Outer Space, taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 
and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms, continued the 
examination and identification of various issues, existing agreements and existing 
proposals, as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in 
outer space,3 and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of 
problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions, 

 Noting also that there were no objections in principle in the Conference on 
Disarmament to the re-establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee, subject to 
re-examination of the mandate contained in the decision of the Conference on 
Disarmament of 13 February 1992,4 

 Emphasizing the mutually complementary nature of bilateral and multilateral 
efforts in the field of preventing an arms race in outer space, and hoping that 
concrete results will emerge from those efforts as soon as possible, 

 Convinced that further measures should be examined in the search for effective 
and verifiable bilateral and multilateral agreements in order to prevent an arms race 
in outer space, including the weaponization of outer space, 

 Stressing that the growing use of outer space increases the need for greater 
transparency and better information on the part of the international community, 

 Recalling, in this context, its previous resolutions, in particular resolutions 
45/55 B of 4 December 1990, 47/51 of 9 December 1992 and 48/74 A of 
16 December 1993, in which, inter alia, it reaffirmed the importance of confidence-
building measures as a means conducive to ensuring the attainment of the objective 
of the prevention of an arms race in outer space, 

 Conscious of the benefits of confidence- and security-building measures in the 
military field, 

 Recognizing that negotiations for the conclusion of an international agreement 
or agreements to prevent an arms race in outer space remain a priority task of the 
Conference on Disarmament and that the concrete proposals on confidence-building 
measures could form an integral part of such agreements,

 Noting with satisfaction the constructive, structured and focused debate on the 
prevention of an arms race in outer space at the Conference on Disarmament in 
2009, 

 Taking note of the introduction by China and the Russian Federation at the 
Conference on Disarmament of the draft treaty on the prevention of the placement 
of weapons in outer space, and of the threat or use of force against outer space 
objects, 

 Taking note also of the decision of the Conference on Disarmament to 
establish for its 2009 session a working group to discuss, substantially, without 
limitation, all issues related to the prevention of an arms race in outer space, 

 1. Reaffirms the importance and urgency of preventing an arms race in outer 
space and the readiness of all States to contribute to that common objective, in 
conformity with the provisions of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities 
of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other 
Celestial Bodies;1 

 2. Reaffirms its recognition, as stated in the report of the Ad Hoc 
Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space, that the legal regime 
applicable to outer space does not in and of itself guarantee the prevention of an 
arms race in outer space, that the regime plays a significant role in the prevention of 
an arms race in that environment, that there is a need to consolidate and reinforce 
that regime and enhance its effectiveness and that it is important to comply strictly 
with existing agreements, both bilateral and multilateral; 

 3. Emphasizes the necessity of further measures with appropriate and 
effective provisions for verification to prevent an arms race in outer space; 

 4. Calls upon all States, in particular those with major space capabilities, to 
contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the 
prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that 
objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining 
international peace and security and promoting international cooperation; 

 5. Reiterates that the Conference on Disarmament, as the sole multilateral 
disarmament negotiating forum, has the primary role in the negotiation of a 
multilateral agreement or agreements, as appropriate, on the prevention of an arms 
race in outer space in all its aspects;  

 6. Invites the Conference on Disarmament to establish a working group 
under its agenda item “Prevention of an arms race in outer space” as early as 
possible during its 2010 session; 

 7. Recognizes, in this respect, the growing convergence of views on the 
elaboration of measures designed to strengthen transparency, confidence and 
security in the peaceful uses of outer space; 

 8. Urges States conducting activities in outer space, as well as States 
interested in conducting such activities, to keep the Conference on Disarmament 
informed of the progress of bilateral and multilateral negotiations on the matter, if 
any, so as to facilitate its work; 

 9. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-fifth session the 
item entitled “Prevention of an arms race in outer space”.
