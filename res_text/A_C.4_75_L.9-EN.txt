towards the implementation of that paragraph and to report to the Assembly on the

emergency assistance, for the well-being, protection and human development of the 

Palestine refugees and for the stability of the region, pending the just resolution of 

the question of the Palestine refugees;  

 4. Calls upon all donors to continue to strengthen their efforts to meet the 

anticipated needs of the Agency, including with regard to increased expenditures and 

needs arising from conflicts and instability in the region and the serious 

socioeconomic and humanitarian situation, particularly in the Occupied Palestinian 

Territory, and those needs mentioned in recent emergency, recovery and 

reconstruction appeals and plans for the Gaza Strip and in the regional crisis response 

plans to address the situation of Palestine refugees in the Syrian Arab Republic and 

those Palestine refugees who have fled to countries in the region;
