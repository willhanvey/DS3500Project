 Emphasizing that the Third Review Conference welcomed the fact that the 

Convention is a unique multilateral agreement banning an entire category of weapons 

of mass destruction in a non-discriminatory and verifiable manner under strict and 

effective international control and noted with satisfaction that the Convention 

continues to be a remarkable success and an example of effective multilateralism,

achieving its object and purpose and to enhancing the security of States parties, as 

well as to international peace and security, underlines the fact that the objectives of 

the Convention will not be fully realized as long as there remains even a single State 

not party to the Convention that could possess or acquire such weapons, calls upon 

all States that have not yet done so to become parties to the Convention without delay, 

and in this regard recalls the outcome of the Third Special Session of the Conference 

of the States Parties to Review the Operation of the Chemical Weapons Convention 

(the Third Review Conference); 

 7. Underlines the fact that the full, effective and non-discriminatory 

implementation of all articles of the Convention makes a major contribution to 

international peace and security through the elimination of existing stockpiles of 

chemical weapons and the prohibition of their acquisition and use, and provides for 

assistance and protection in the event of use or threat of use of chemical weapons and 

for international cooperation for peaceful purposes in the field of chemical activities;  

 8. Notes the impact of scientific and technological progress on the effective 

implementation of the Convention and the importance for the Organisation for the 

Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and its policymaking organs of taking due account 

of such developments;

destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles and the destruction or conversion of 

chemical weapons production facilities in accordance with the provisions of the 

Convention and the Annex on Implementation and Verification (Verification Annex) 

and under the verification of the Technical Secretariat of the Organisation for the 

Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is essential for the realization of the object and 

purpose of the Convention; 

 10. Stresses the importance to the Convention that all possessors of chemical 

weapons, chemical weapons production facilities or chemical weapons development 

facilities, including previously declared possessor States, should be among the States 

parties to the Convention, and welcomes progress to that end;  

 11. Recalls that the Third Review Conference expressed concern regarding the 

statement made by the Director General of the Organisation for the Prohibition of 

Chemical Weapons in his report to the Executive Council of the Organisation at its 

sixty-eighth session, provided in accordance with paragraph 2 of decision 

C-16/DEC.11 of 1 December 2011 adopted by the Conference of the States Parties at 

its sixteenth session, that three possessor States parties, namely, Libya, the Russian 

Federation and the United States of America, had been unable to fully meet the final 

extended deadline of 29 April 2012 for the destruction of their chemical weapons 

stockpiles, and also expressed determination that the destruction of all c ategories of 

chemical weapons should be completed in the shortest time possible in accordance

application of the relevant decisions that have been taken;  

 12. Welcomes the confirmation by the Director General of the Organisation for 

the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons expressed in his report of 5 October 2017, 12

completion of the full destruction of chemical weapons declared by the Russian 

Federation; 

 13. Also welcomes the completed destruction of Libya’s remaining category 2 

chemical weapons, as reported by the Director General of the Organisation for the

completed destruction by Iraq of its entire declared stockpile of chemical weapons 

remnants, as reported by the Director General in his report of 28 February 2018; 14 

 14. Notes with concern that, along with the threat of the possible production, 

acquisition and use of chemical weapons by States, the international community also 

faces the danger of the production, acquisition and use of chemical weapons by 

non-State actors, including terrorists, concerns which have highlighted the necessity 

of achieving universal adherence to the Convention, as well as the high level of 

readiness of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and stresses 

that the full and effective implementation of all provisions of the Convention, 

including those on national implementation (article VII) and assistance and protection 

(article X), constitutes an important contribution to the efforts of the United Nations

Chemical Weapons in verifying compliance with the provisions of the Convention as 

well as in promoting the timely and efficient accomplishment of all its objectives;  

 17. Expresses grave concern that, despite the verified destruction of all 

27 chemical weapons production facilities declared by the Syrian Arab Republic, the 

Technical Secretariat, as recently reported by the Director General in his report of 

24 September 2021,15 cannot fully verify that the Syrian Arab Republic has submitted 

a declaration that can be considered accurate and complete in accordance with the 

Convention or Executive Council decision EC-M-33/DEC.1 as well as with 

the conclusion of decision C-SS-4/DEC.3, of the Fourth Review Conference, that the 

Syrian Arab Republic failed to declare and destroy all of its chemical weapons and 

chemical weapons production facilities, and underscores the importance of such full 

verification; 

 18. Urges all States parties to the Convention to meet in full and on time their 

obligations under the Convention and to support the Organisation for the Prohibition 

of Chemical Weapons in its implementation activities; 

 19. Welcomes the progress made in the national implementation of article VII 

obligations, commends the States parties and the Technical Secretariat for assisting 

other States parties, on request, with the implementation of the follow-up to the plan

threats as articulated in article X, and welcomes the effectiveness and efficiency of 

the increased focus on making full use of regional and subregional capacities and 

expertise, including taking advantage of established training centres; 

 21. Reaffirms that the provisions of the Convention shall be implemented in a 

manner that avoids hampering the economic or technological development of States 

parties and international cooperation in the field of chemical activities for purposes
