 The Security Council, 

Recalling its resolutions and the statements of its President concerning the 
situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in Burundi and in the Great 
Lakes region of Africa,  

Paying tribute again to the citizens of the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
for the remarkable commitment they have demonstrated to the democratic process,  

Taking note of the letter of the Secretary-General dated 15 November 2006 
(S/2006/892), and of the recommendation it contains,  

Noting that the 50 military observers deployed in the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo under the authorized military strength of the United Nations Operation in 
Burundi (ONUB) pursuant to resolutions 1669 (2006) and 1692 (2006) have 
successfully performed observation tasks related to the electoral process and will be 
repatriated by 31 December 2006, 

Condemning the continuation of hostilities by militias and foreign armed 
groups in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the threat 
they pose to the security of civilians and to the stability of the region,  

Deploring the persistence of violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in particular those 
carried out by these militias and foreign armed groups and by elements of the Armed 
Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC), and stressing the urgent 
need for those responsible for these crimes to be brought to justice,  

Bearing in mind that the mandates of ONUB and of the United Nations 
Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) will 
expire respectively on 31 December 2006 and on 15 February 2007, 

Looking forward to the Secretary-General’s proposals, after close consultations 
with the new Congolese authorities, regarding MONUC’s future mandate, including 
a review of the Mission’s military strength, 

Noting that the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to 
constitute a threat to international peace and security in the region,  

Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  

1. Authorizes, from 1 January 2007 until the expiry of MONUC’s current 
mandate on 15 February 2007, an increase in the military strength of MONUC of up 
to 916 military personnel, to allow for the continued deployment to MONUC of the 



S/2006/1014  
 

06-68044 2 
 

infantry battalion and the military hospital currently authorized under the ONUB 
mandate and expresses its intention to examine this issue further before 15 February, 
in the context of the Secretary-General’s forthcoming proposals, with a view to 
ensuring that MONUC has adequate capabilities to perform its mandate; 

2. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
