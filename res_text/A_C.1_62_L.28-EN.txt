  Australia, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, New Zealand  
and Turkey: draft resolution 
 
 

  Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Reiterating that the cessation of nuclear-weapon test explosions or any other 
nuclear explosions constitutes an effective nuclear disarmament and  
non-proliferation measure, and convinced that this is a meaningful step in the 
realization of a systematic process to achieve nuclear disarmament, 

 Recalling that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, adopted by its 
resolution 50/245 of 10 September 1996, was opened for signature on 24 September 
1996, 

 Stressing that a universal and effectively verifiable Treaty constitutes a 
fundamental instrument in the field of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation 
and that after more than ten years, its entry into force is more urgent than ever 
before,  

 Encouraged by the signing of the Treaty by one hundred and seventy-seven 
States, including forty-one of the forty-four needed for its entry into force, and 
welcoming the ratification of one hundred and forty States, including thirty-four of 
the forty-four needed for its entry into force, among which there are three nuclear-
weapon States, 

 Recalling its resolution 61/104 of 6 December 2006, 

 Welcoming the Final Declaration of the fifth Conference on Facilitating the 
Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, held in Vienna on 
17 and 18 September 2007,1 pursuant to article XIV of the Treaty,

 1. Stresses the vital importance and urgency of signature and ratification, 
without delay and without conditions, to achieve the earliest entry into force of the 
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty; 

 2. Welcomes the contributions by the States signatories to the work of the 
Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty 
Organization, in particular its efforts to ensure that the Treaty’s verification regime 
will be capable of meeting the verification requirements of the Treaty upon its entry 
into force, in accordance with article IV of the Treaty; 

 3. Underlines the need to maintain momentum towards completion of all 
elements of the verification regime; 

 4. Urges all States not to carry out nuclear-weapon test explosions or any 
other nuclear explosions, to maintain their moratoriums in this regard and to refrain 
from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of the Treaty, while stressing that 
these measures do not have the same permanent and legally binding effect as the 
entry into force of the Treaty; 

 5. Calls for a peaceful solution of the nuclear issues on the Korean 
Peninsula through successful implementation of the Joint Statement, and the initial 
and second-phase actions to implement it, agreed upon in the framework of the 
Six-Party Talks; 

 6. Urges all States that have not yet signed the Treaty to sign and ratify it as 
soon as possible; 

 7. Urges all States that have signed but not yet ratified the Treaty, in 
particular those whose ratification is needed for its entry into force, to accelerate 
their ratification processes with a view to ensuring their earliest successful 
conclusion; 

 8. Urges all States to remain seized of the issue at the highest political level 
and, where in a position to do so, to promote adherence to the Treaty through 
bilateral and joint outreach, seminars and other means; 

 9. Requests the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Preparatory 
Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, to 
prepare a report on the efforts of States that have ratified the Treaty towards its 
universalization and possibilities for providing assistance on ratification procedures 
to States that so request it, and to submit such a report to the General Assembly at 
its sixty-third session; 

 10. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-third session the 
item entitled “Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty”.
