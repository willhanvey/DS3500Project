  Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty 
 
 

 The General Assembly,  

 Reiterating that the cessation of nuclear-weapon test explosions or any other 
nuclear explosions constitutes an effective nuclear disarmament and 
non-proliferation measure, and convinced that this is a meaningful step in the 
realization of a systematic process for achieving nuclear disarmament,  

 Recalling that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, adopted by its 
resolution 50/245 of 10 September 1996, was opened for signature on 24 September 
1996,  

 Stressing that a universal and effectively verifiable Treaty constitutes a 
fundamental instrument in the field of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation 
and that, after more than 15 years, its entry into force is more urgent than ever 
before,  

 Encouraged by the signing of the Treaty by 183 States, including 41 of the 44 
whose ratification is needed for its entry into force, and welcoming the ratification

of the Treaty by 161 States, including 36 of the 44 whose ratification is needed for 
its entry into force, among which there are 3 nuclear-weapon States,  

 Recalling its resolution 67/76 of 3 December 2012,  

 Welcoming the adoption by consensus of the conclusions and recommendations 
for follow-on actions of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on 
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,1 which, inter alia, reaffirmed the vital 
importance of the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as 
a core element of the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation 
regime and included specific actions to be taken in support of the entry into force of 
the Treaty,  

 Also welcoming the Final Declaration adopted by the eighth Conference on 
Facilitating the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, 
held in New York on 27 September 2013, convened pursuant to article XIV of the 
Treaty, and recalling the Joint Ministerial Statement on the Comprehensive Nuclear-
Test-Ban Treaty, adopted at the ministerial meeting held in New York on  
27 September 2012,2  

 Taking note of the establishment of a group of eminent persons to complement 
efforts to secure ratifications from the remaining Annex 2 countries and to support 
the article XIV process, 

 Gravely concerned that since its previous resolution on this subject, a nuclear 
test has been carried out,  

 1. Stresses the vital importance and urgency of signature and ratification, 
without delay and without conditions, in order to achieve the earliest entry into 
force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty;3  

 2. Welcomes the contributions by the signatory States to the work of the 
Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty 
Organization, in particular its efforts to ensure that the verification regime of the 
Treaty will be capable of meeting the verification requirements of the Treaty upon 
its entry into force, in accordance with article IV of the Treaty;  

 3. Underlines the need to maintain momentum towards completion of all 
elements of the verification regime;  

 4. Urges all States not to carry out nuclear-weapon test explosions or any 
other nuclear explosions, to maintain their moratoriums in this regard and to refrain 
from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of the Treaty, while stressing that 
these measures do not have the same permanent and legally binding effect as the 
entry into force of the Treaty;  

 5. Shares the grave concern of the Security Council about the nuclear test 
conducted by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on 12 February 2013, 
expressed in Council resolution 2094 (2013) of 7 March 2013, recalls Council 
resolutions 1718 (2006) of 14 October 2006 and 1874 (2009) of 12 June 2009, calls
