 Expressing deep concern at the adverse economic, social and environmental 
impacts of the physical alteration and destruction of marine habitats that may result 
from land-based and coastal development activities, in particular those land 
reclamation activities that are carried out in a manner that has a detrimental impact 
on the marine environment,  

 Reiterating its serious concern at the current and projected adverse effects of 
climate change on the marine environment and marine biodiversity, and 
emphasizing the urgency of addressing this issue,  

 Expressing concern that climate change continues to increase the severity and 
incidence of coral bleaching throughout tropical seas and weakens the ability of 
reefs to withstand ocean acidification, which could have serious and irreversible 
negative effects on marine organisms, particularly corals, as well as to withstand 
other pressures, including overfishing and pollution,  

 Reiterating its deep concern at the vulnerability of the environment and the 
fragile ecosystems of the polar regions, including the Arctic Ocean and the Arctic 
ice cap, particularly affected by the projected adverse effects of climate change,  

 Recognizing the need for a more integrated and ecosystem-based approach to, 
further study of and the promotion of measures for enhanced cooperation, 
coordination and collaboration relating to, the conservation and sustainable use of

 Recognizing further that hydrographic surveys and nautical charting are 
critical to the safety of navigation and life at sea, environmental protection, 
including the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems, and the economics of the 
global shipping industry, and encouraging further efforts towards electronic charting, 
which not only provides significantly increased benefits for safe navigation and 
management of ship movement, but also provides data and information that can be 
used for sustainable fisheries activities and other sectoral uses of the marine 
environment, the delimitation of maritime boundaries and environmental protection, 
and noting the entry into force of amendments to the International Convention for 
the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, on requirements for ships on international voyages 
to carry an electronic chart display information system,  

 Recognizing that ocean data buoys deployed and operated in accordance with 
international law are critical for saving lives by detecting storm surges and tsunamis 
and for improving understanding of weather, climate and ecosystems, and reiterating 
its serious concern at intentional and unintentional damage to such buoys,

terrorist acts against shipping, offshore installations and other maritime interests, 
and noting the deplorable loss of life and adverse impact on international trade, 
energy security and the global economy resulting from such activities,  

 Recognizing that fibre-optic submarine cables transmit most of the world’s 
data and communications and, hence, are vitally important to the global economy 
and the national security of all States, conscious that these cables are susceptible to 
intentional and accidental damage from shipping and other activities, and that the 
maintenance, including the repair, of these cables is important, noting that these 
matters have been brought to the attention of States at various workshops and 
seminars, and conscious of the need for States to adopt national laws and regulations 
to protect submarine cables and render their wilful damage or damage by culpable 
negligence punishable offences,  

 Noting the importance of the delineation of the outer limits of the continental 
shelf beyond 200 nautical miles and that it is in the broader interest of the 
international community that coastal States with a continental shelf beyond 
200 nautical miles submit information on the outer limits of the continental shelf 
beyond 200 nautical miles to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf 
(“the Commission”), and welcoming the submissions to the Commission by a 
considerable number of States Parties on the outer limits of their continental shelf 
beyond 200 nautical miles, that the Commission has continued to fulfil its role, 
including of making recommendations to coastal States, and that the summaries of 
recommendations are being made publicly available,9  

 Noting also that many coastal States Parties have submitted preliminary 
information indicative of the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical 
miles, as provided for in the decision of the eighteenth Meeting of States Parties to 
the Convention regarding the workload of the Commission and the ability of States, 
particularly developing States, to fulfil the requirements of article 4 of annex II to 
the Convention, as well as the decision contained in SPLOS/72, paragraph (a),10  

 Noting further that some coastal States may continue to face particular 
challenges in relation to preparing and presenting submissions to the Commission, 

 Noting that financial and technical assistance may be sought by developing 
countries for activities in relation to preparing and presenting submissions to the 
Commission, including through the voluntary trust fund established by resolution 55/7 
of 30 October 2000 for the purpose of facilitating the preparation of submissions to 
the Commission for developing States, in particular the least developed countries 
and small island developing States, and compliance with article 76 of the 
Convention, as well as other accessible international assistance,  

 Recognizing the importance of the trust funds established by resolution 55/7 in 
facilitating the participation of members of the Commission from developing States 
in the meetings of the Commission and in fulfilling the requirements of article 4 of

that the legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of marine 
biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction effectively addresses those issues 
by identifying gaps and ways forward, including through the implementation of 
existing instruments and the possible development of a multilateral agreement under 
the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea; 

 (b) This process would address the conservation and sustainable use of 
marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, in particular, together and 
as a whole, marine genetic resources, including questions on the sharing of benefits, 
measures such as area-based management tools, including marine protected areas, 
and environmental impact assessments, capacity-building and the transfer of marine 
technology; 

 (c) This process would take place: (i) in the existing Working Group; and 
(ii) in the format of intersessional workshops aimed at improving understanding of 
the issues and clarifying key questions as an input to the work of the Working 
Group;  

 (d) The mandate of the Working Group be reviewed and, as appropriate, 
amended, with a view to undertaking the tasks entrusted by the present 
recommendations; 

 (e) The Secretary-General be requested to convene a meeting of the Working 
Group in 2012 to make progress on all issues under examination within the Working 
Group and to provide recommendations to the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh
