 Recalling the discussions held at the Conferences on the Humanitarian Impact 

of Nuclear Weapons, hosted by Norway, on 4 and 5 March 2013, Mexico, on 13 and 

14 February 2014, and Austria, on 8 and 9 December 2014, aimed at understanding 

and developing a greater awareness of the catastrophic consequences of nuclear 

weapon detonations which further reinforce the urgency of nuclear disarmament,  

 Emphasizing the compelling evidence, including that presented at the 

Conferences on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons, that has detailed the 

catastrophic consequences that would result from a nuclear weapon detonation, 

reaching well beyond national borders and also imperilling the achievement of the 

Sustainable Development Goals, the lack of capacity of States and international 

organizations to deal with the aftermath and the risk of an occurrence, due to an 

accident, systems failure or human error,  

 Noting the research findings presented to the Vienna Conference regarding the 

strongly disproportionate and gendered impact of exposure to ionizing radiation for 

women and girls,  

 Recalling the convening, on 26 September 2013, of the high -level meeting of 

the General Assembly on nuclear disarmament and its resolution 70/34 of 

7 December 2015 on follow-up to that meeting and the decisions contained therein, 

and taking note of the report of the Secretary-General submitted pursuant to that 

resolution,
2
  

 Welcoming the commemoration and promotion of 26 September as the 

International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons,  

 Welcoming also the convening of the Open-ended Working Group established 

pursuant to resolution 70/33 of 7 December 2015 on taking forward multilateral 

nuclear disarmament negotiations, as well as the report on its work submitted 

pursuant to that resolution,
3
  

 Underlining the importance of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation 

education,  

 Reaffirming that transparency, verifiability and irreversibility are cardinal 

principles applying to nuclear disarmament and nuclear non -proliferation, which are 

mutually reinforcing processes,  

 Recalling the decisions and the resolution adopted at the 1995 Review and 

Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non -Proliferation of 

Nuclear Weapons,

elimination of their nuclear arsenals, leading to nuclear disarmament, in accordance 

with commitments made under article VI of the Treaty on the Non -Proliferation of 

Nuclear Weapons,
7
  

 Reaffirming the commitment of all States parties to the Treaty on the 

Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to applying the principles of irreversibility, 

verifiability and transparency in relation to the implementation of their treaty 

obligations,  

 Recognizing the continued vital importance of the entry into force of the 

Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty
8
 to the advancement of nuclear disarmament 

and nuclear non-proliferation objectives, and welcoming the recent ratification of 

the Treaty by Myanmar and Swaziland,  

 Recalling that the total elimination of nuclear weapons is the only absolute 

guarantee against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons and the legitimate 

interest of non-nuclear-weapon States in receiving unequivocal and legally binding 

negative security assurances from nuclear-weapon States pending the total 

elimination of nuclear weapons,  

 Reaffirming the conviction that, pending the total elimination of nuclear 

weapons, the establishment and maintenance of nuclear-weapon-free zones 

enhances global and regional peace and security, strengthens the nuclear 

non-proliferation regime and contributes towards realizing the objectives of nuclear 

disarmament, and welcoming the Conferences of States Parties and Signatories to 

Treaties that Establish Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones and Mongolia,  

 Welcoming the ratification by China, France, the Russian Federation and the 

United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of the Protocol to the Treaty 

on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia, and urging those States to continue 

to make real progress towards strengthening all existing nuclear -weapon-free zones, 

inter alia through the withdrawal or revision of any reservations or interpretative 

declarations contrary to the object and purpose of the treaties establishing such 

zones,  

 Recalling the encouragement expressed at the 2010 Review Conference for the 

establishment of further nuclear-weapon-free zones, on the basis of arrangements 

freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned, reaffirming the 

expectation that this will be followed by concerted international efforts to create 

such zones in areas where they do not currently exist, especially in the Middle East, 

in this context noting with deep disappointment the non -fulfilment of the agreement 

at the 2010 Review Conference on practical steps to fully implement the 1995 

resolution on the Middle East, and disappointed that no agreement could be reached 

at the 2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non -Proliferation 

of Nuclear Weapons on this issue,  

 Deeply disappointed at the continued absence of progress towards multilateral 

nuclear disarmament at the Conference on Disarmament, which has been unable for 

the past 20 years to agree upon and implement a programme of work, and

disappointed that the Disarmament Commission has not produced a substantive 

outcome since 1999,  

 Deeply regretting the lack of any substantive outcome of the 2015 Review 

Conference,  

 Disappointed that the 2015 Review Conference missed an opportunity to 

strengthen the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, enhance 

progress towards its full implementation and universality and monitor the 

implementation of commitments made and actions agreed upon at the 1995, 2000

failure on the Treaty and the balance between its three pillars ,  

 Acknowledging the ongoing efforts towards the full implementation of the 

Treaty between the Russian Federation and the United States of America on 

Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, 

while re-emphasizing the encouragement of the 2010 Review Conference to both 

States to continue discussions on follow-on measures in order to achieve deeper 

reductions in their nuclear arsenals,
