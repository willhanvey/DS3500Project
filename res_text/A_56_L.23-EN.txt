administration on the Holy City of Jerusalem is illegal and therefore null and void
and has no validity whatsoever;

Jerusalem in violation of Security Council resolution 478 (1980) and their refusal to
comply with the provisions of that resolution;

3. Calls once more upon those States to abide by the provisions of the
relevant United Nations resolutions, in conformity with the Charter of the United
Nations;

4. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its
fifty-seventh session on the implementation of the present resolution.
