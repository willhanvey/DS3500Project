 Reaffirming once more the illegality of the decision of 14 December 1981 
taken by Israel to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied 
Syrian Golan, which has resulted in the effective annexation of that territory, 

 Reaffirming that the acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible under 
international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, 

 Reaffirming also the applicability of the Geneva Convention relative to the 
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949,3 to the occupied 
Syrian Golan, 

 Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 237 (1967) of 14 June 1967, 

 Welcoming the convening at Madrid of the Peace Conference on the Middle 
East on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 
and 338 (1973) of 22 October 1973 aimed at the realization of a just, comprehensive 
and lasting peace, and expressing grave concern about the stalling of the peace 
process on all tracks, 

 1. Calls upon Israel, the occupying Power, to comply with the relevant 
resolutions on the occupied Syrian Golan, in particular Security Council resolution 
497 (1981), in which the Council, inter alia, decided that the Israeli decision to 
impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan was 
null and void and without international legal effect and demanded that Israel, the 
occupying Power, rescind forthwith its decision; 

 2. Also calls upon Israel to desist from changing the physical character, 
demographic composition, institutional structure and legal status of the occupied 
Syrian Golan and in particular to desist from the establishment of settlements;  

 3. Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions 
taken or to be taken by Israel, the occupying Power, that purport to alter the 
character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void, constitute 
a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to 
the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949,3 and have no 
legal effect; 

 4. Calls upon Israel to desist from imposing Israeli citizenship and Israeli 
identity cards on the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan, and from its 
repressive measures against the population of the occupied Syrian Golan; 

 5. Deplores the violations by Israel of the Geneva Convention relative to 
the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949; 

 6. Calls once again upon Member States not to recognize any of the 
legislative or administrative measures and actions referred to above; 

 7. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its 
sixty-seventh session on the implementation of the present resolution.
