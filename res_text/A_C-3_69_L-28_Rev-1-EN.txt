summary and arbitrary executions; the imposition of the death penalty for 

political and religious reasons; collective punishments extending up to three 

generations; and the extensive use of forced labour;  

 (ii) The existence of an extensive system of political prison camps, where a 

vast number of persons are deprived of their liberty and subjected to 

deplorable conditions and where alarming violations of human rights are 

perpetrated, and in this regard strongly urges the Democratic People’s 

Republic of Korea to immediately end this practice and to release all political 

prisoners unconditionally and without any delay;  

 (iii) The forcible transfer of populations and the limitations imposed on every

abroad, leading to punishments of internment, torture, other cruel, inhuman or 

degrading treatment, sexual violence or the death penalty, and in this regard 

strongly urges all States to respect the fundamental principle of  

non-refoulement, to treat those who seek refuge humanely and to ensure 

unhindered access to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and 

his Office, with a view to protecting the human rights of those who seek 

refuge, and once again urges States parties to comply with their obligations

and the right of everyone to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly 

or through freely chosen representatives, of his or her country;  

 (vi) Violations of economic, social and cultural rights, which have led to 

severe hunger, malnutrition, widespread health problems and other hardship 

for the population in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, in particular 

for women, children, persons with disabilities and the elderly; 

 (vii) Violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women, in

including in the political and social spheres, and other forms of sexual and 

gender-based violence; 

 (viii) Violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of children, in

children with disabilities, children whose parents are detained, children living 

in detention or in institutions and children in conflict with the law;

association and effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, the

Cultural Rights,
3

and of any harmful or hazardous work of children as defined by the 

obligations of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea under the 

Convention on the Rights of the Child;
4
 

 (xi) Discrimination based on the songbun system, which classifies people on 

the basis of State-assigned social class and birth, and also includes 

consideration of political opinions and religion;  

 (b) The continued refusal of the Government of the Democratic People’s 

Republic of Korea to recognize the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the 

situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea or to extend 

cooperation to the Special Rapporteur; 

 (c) The continued lack of acknowledgement by the Democratic People’s 

Republic of Korea of the grave human rights situation in the country and its 

consequential lack of action to implement the recommendations contained in the 

outcome of its first universal periodic review;12 

 (d) The failure of the authorities of the Democratic People’s Republic of 

Korea to prosecute those responsible for human rights violations, including 

violations which the commission of inquiry has said may amount to crimes against 

humanity; 

 3. Underscores its very serious concern at the systematic abduction, denial 

of repatriation and subsequent enforced disappearance of persons, including those 

from other countries, on a large scale and as a matter of State policy, and in this 

regard strongly calls upon the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of 

Korea urgently to resolve these issues of international concern, in a transparent 

manner, including by ensuring the immediate return of abductees;

14-64817 6/8 

 

 4. Expresses its very deep concern at the precarious humanitarian situation 

in the country, which could rapidly deteriorate owing to limited resilience to natural 

disasters and to government policies causing limitations in the availability of and 

access to food, compounded by structural weaknesses in agricultural production 

resulting in significant shortages of diversified food and the State restrictions on the 

cultivation and trade in foodstuffs, as well as the prevalence of chronic malnutrition, 

particularly among the most vulnerable groups, pregnant women, children, persons 

with disabilities and the elderly, and urges the Government of the Democratic 

People’s Republic of Korea, in this regard, to take preventive and remedial action, 

cooperating where necessary with international donor agencies and in accordance 

with international standards for monitoring humanitarian assistance;  

 5. Commends the Special Rapporteur for the activities undertaken so far 

and for his continued efforts in the conduct of his mandate despite the denial of 

access; 

 6. Also commends the work of the commission of inquiry and recognizes 

the importance of its report, and regrets that the commission received no 

cooperation from the authorities of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, 

including with regard to access to the country; 

 7. Acknowledges the commission’s finding that the body of testimony 

gathered and the information received provide reasonable grounds to believe that 

crimes against humanity have been committed in the Democratic People’s Republic 

of Korea, pursuant to policies established at the highest level of the State for 

decades; 

 8.  Decides to submit the report of the commission of inquiry to the Security 

Council, and encourages the Council to consider the relevant conclusions and 

recommendations of the commission and take appropriate action to ensure 

accountability, including through consideration of referral of the situation in the 

Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to the International Criminal Court and 

consideration of the scope for effective targeted sanctions against those who appear 

to be most responsible for acts that the commission has said may constitute crimes 

against humanity; 

 9. Welcomes the steps taken by the Office of the United Nations High 

Commissioner for Human Rights towards establishing a field-based structure in the 

Republic of Korea to strengthen the monitoring and documentation of the situation 

of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, to ensure 

accountability, to provide the Special Rapporteur with increased support, to enhance 

the engagement and capacity-building of the Governments of all States concerned, 

civil society and other stakeholders and to maintain the visibility of the situation of 

human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, including through 

sustained communications, advocacy and outreach initiatives;  

 10. Calls upon Member States to undertake to ensure that the field-based 

structure of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 

can function with independence, that it has sufficient resources and that it is not 

subjected to any reprisals or threats;  

 11. Strongly urges the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of 

Korea to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, in this 

regard:

violations of human rights emphasized above, inter alia, by implementing fully the

Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council, and the 

recommendations addressed to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea by the 

Council in the context of the universal periodic review and by the commission of

food security policies, including through sustainable agriculture, sound food 

production distribution measures and the allocation of more funds to the food sector, 

and to ensure adequate monitoring of humanitarian assistance;  

 (j) To further improve cooperation with the United Nations country team 

and development agencies so that they can directly contribute to improving the 

living conditions of the civilian population, including accelerating  progress towards 

the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, in accordance with 

international monitoring and evaluation procedures;  

 (k) To consider ratifying and acceding to remaining international human 

rights treaties, which would enable a dialogue with the human rights treaty bodies; 

 12. Urges the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to 

implement the recommendations of the commission of inquiry without delay;
