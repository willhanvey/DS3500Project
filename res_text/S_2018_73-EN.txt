  France: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council,  

 Recalling its previous resolutions and statements on the Central African Republic 

(CAR), in particular resolutions 2121 (2013), 2127 (2013), 2134 (2014), 2149 (2014), 

2181 (2014), 2196 (2015), 2212 (2015), 2217 (2015), 2262 (2016), 2264 (2016), 2281 

(2016), 2301 (2016), 2339 (2017), 2387 (2017) as well as resolution 2272 (2016), and 

the Statements of its President of 18 December 2014 (S/PRST/2014/28), 20 October 

2015 (S/PRST/2015/17), 16 November 2016 (S/PRST/2016/17), 4 April 2017 

(S/PRST/2017/5), and 13 July 2017 (S/PRST/2017/9), 

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 

territorial integrity of the CAR, and recalling the importance of the principles of 

non-interference, good-neighbourliness and regional cooperation,  

 Recalling that the CAR bears the primary responsibility to protect all 

populations within its territory from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and 

crimes against humanity,  

 Expressing concern at the deterioration of the security situation, in particular in 

the south-eastern part and the north-western part of the CAR, due to the ongoing 

clashes between armed groups and other armed spoilers in their attempts to forcefully 

gain control of territory and resources and destabilize the country, as well as the lack 

of capacity of the national security forces, the limited authority of the State over all 

of the CAR territory, and the persistence of the root causes of the conflict,  

 Emphasizing that any sustainable solution to the crisis in the CAR should be 

CAR-owned, including the political process, and should prioritize reconciliation of 

the Central African people, through an inclusive process that involves men and 

women of all social, economic, political, religious and ethnic backgrounds, including, 

those displaced by the crisis,  

 Calling upon the CAR authorities to continue their efforts to implement 

transparent and inclusive measures that allow for stabilization and reconciliation in 

the CAR and restore the effective authority of the State over all of the territory of the 

CAR; to fight impunity by restoring administration of the judiciary and the criminal 

justice system, including the penitentiary system, throughout the country; to achieve 

the reform of the CAR Armed Forces (FACA) and internal security forces in order to 

put in place multi-ethnic, professional, and republican security services through 

appropriate security sector reform processes; to carry out the inclusive and effective 

disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and repatriation (DDRR) of armed 

groups, including children formerly associated with them and to prevent the 



S/2018/73 
 

 

18-013892/11 

 

re-recruitment of the latter; and to establish a functioning public financial 

management in order to meet the expenses related to the functioning of the State, 

implement early recovery plans, and revitalize the economy, 

 Welcoming the African Initiative for Peace and Reconciliation in the CAR that 

led to the adoption of the roadmap by the ministerial conference held in Libreville on 

17 July 2017 by the CAR authorities, the African Union, the Economic Community 

of Central African States (ECCAS), the International Conference on the Great Lakes 

region (ICGLR) with the support of Angola, Chad, Congo and Gabon, and reaffirming 

that this Initiative and this roadmap constitute the main framework for a political 

solution in the CAR, as agreed by CAR authorities and under their leadership, 

 Encouraging the CAR authorities, in collaboration with the United Nations 

Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic 

(MINUSCA) and the European Union Training Mission in the CAR (EUTM-RCA), 

to provide equal opportunities for members of armed groups, whether anti-Balaka or 

ex-Séléka, in the process of selecting eligible demobilized members to integrate into 

the national security and defence forces, welcoming in this regard the launch of the 

DDRR pilot project, and further encouraging the CAR authorities to ensure that 

FACA soldiers of all prefectures enjoy equal access to the registration and simplified 

verification process,  

 Underlining the importance of rebuilding a multi-ethnic, republican and 

professional national army in the CAR, recognizing in this regard the work carried 

out by the EUTM-RCA, welcoming the support of other international and regional 

partners to the training of the national security and defence forces in support of the 

CAR authorities, and encouraging effective coordination with MINUSCA and 

EUTM-RCA,  

 Calling upon the CAR authorities to ensure that perpetrators of violations of 

applicable international law, including those committed against children and women, 

are excluded from the CAR security and armed forces, and further calling for support 

for the CAR government to develop a comprehensive strategy on sexual and gender-

based violence to reduce overall levels of sexual violence, 

 Welcoming the commitment of the Secretary-General to enforce strictly his zero-

tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA), noting the various measures 

taken by MINUSCA and Troop- and Police-contributing countries to combat SEA, 

which has led to a reduction in reported cases, but still expressing grave concern over 

numerous allegations of SEA reportedly committed by peacekeepers in the CAR, as 

well as by non-United Nations forces, stressing the urgent need for Troop- and Police-

contributing countries and, as appropriate, MINUSCA to promptly investigate those 

cases in a credible and transparent manner and to hold accountable those responsible 

for such criminal offences or misconduct, and further stressing the need to prevent 

such exploitation and abuse and to improve how these allegations are addressed in 

line with resolution 2272 (2016),  

 Welcoming the Secretary-General’s Report of 16 October 2017 (S/2017/865) 

submitted pursuant to resolution 2301 (2016), and taking note of his letter dated 

10 July 2017 addressed to the President of the Security Council (S/2017/597) 

pursuant to paragraph 29 of resolution 2339 (2017),  

 Further welcoming also the mid-term update and the final report (S/2017/1023) 

of the Panel of Experts on the CAR established pursuant to resolution 2127 (2013), 

expanded by resolution 2134 (2014) and extended pursuant to resolution 2339 (2017), 

and taking note of the Panel of Experts’ recommendations,  

 Strongly condemning the ongoing violence and instability in the CAR, and the 

threats of violence, incitement to ethnic and religious hatred and violence, human 



 
S/2018/73

 

3/1118-01389 

 

rights violations and abuses and international humanitarian law violations, as well as 

sexual and gender-based violence, in particular against children, committed notably 

by both ex-Seleka and anti-Balaka elements and other armed groups; the attacks and 

incitement to violence against United Nations peacekeepers and humanitarian 

personnel; the continuous cycle of provocations and reprisals by armed groups, both 

inside and outside Bangui and denial of humanitarian access, committed by armed 

elements, which continue to adversely affect the dire humanitarian situation faced by 

the civilian population and to impede humanitarian access to vulnerable populations,  

 Stressing the urgent and imperative need to end impunity in the CAR and to 

bring to justice perpetrators of these acts, some of which may amount to crimes under 

the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), to which the CAR is a 

State party, noting in this regard the opening by the Prosecutor of the International 

Criminal Court on 24 September 2014 of an investigation following the request of the 

national authorities on alleged crimes committed since 2012, and welcoming the 

ongoing cooperation by the CAR authorities in this regard,  

 Stressing the importance of putting in place an effective national judicial 

system, underlining the need to bolster national accountability mechanisms, including 

through further implementation of the 7 August 2014 Memorandum of Understanding 

(MoU) on Urgent Temporary Measures, welcoming in this regard the progressive 

operationalization of the Special Criminal Court (SCC) to investigate and prosecute 

serious crimes committed in the CAR, and recalling the importance of continuous 

support of the international community to this process pursued by the CAR 

authorities,  

 Emphasizing that those engaging in or providing support for acts that undermine 

the peace, stability or security of the CAR, threaten or impede the political 

stabilization and reconciliation process, target civilians and attack peacekeepers may 

meet criteria for designation under sanctions as stated in this resolution,  

 Expressing concern that illicit trafficking, trade, exploitation and smuggling of 

natural resources including gold, diamonds and wildlife has a negative impact in the 

economy and the development of the country, and that it continues to threaten the 

peace and stability of the CAR,  

 Recalling the Kimberley Process (KP) Administrative Decision on Resumption 

of Exports of Rough Diamonds from the CAR, its annexed Operational Framework, 

and the work of the KP Monitoring Team for CAR, and recognizing the need to 

strengthen the efforts of the CAR Authorities and the KP, to responsibly and 

progressively, through pre-established “compliant zones”, reintegrate the CAR into 

the global diamond trade,  

 Noting with concern the findings of the Panel of Experts’ final report that the 

Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) remains active in the south-eastern part of the CAR 

having carried out the killing and abduction of civilians, including children and 

women,  

 Further noting with concern the ongoing transnational criminal activity in the 

region, emphasizing the risk of the situation in the CAR providing a conducive 

environment for further transnational criminal activities, such as those involving arms 

trafficking and the use of mercenaries as well as a potential breeding ground for 

radical networks,  

 Acknowledging in this respect the important contribution the Council-mandated 

arms embargo can make to countering the illicit transfer of arms and related materiel 

in the CAR and its region, and in supporting post-conflict peacebuilding, DDRR and 

Security sector reform (SSR) processes, recalling its resolutions 2117 (2013), 2127 

(2013), 2220 (2015), 2262 (2016) and 2339 (2017) and expressing grave concern at 



S/2018/73 
 

 

18-013894/11 

 

the threat to peace and security in the CAR arising from the illicit transfer, 

destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons, and the use 

of such weapons against civilians affected by armed conflict,  

 Reiterating the importance of all Member States’ full implementation of the 

measures set out in resolutions 2127 (2013), 2134 (2014), 2196 (2015), 2262 (2016), 

2339 (2017) and this resolution, including the obligation to implement targeted 

sanctions against individuals and entities designated by the Sanctions Committee 

established pursuant to resolution 2127 (2013) (the Committee),  

 Noting the critical importance of effective implementation of the sanctions 

regime, including the key role that neighbouring States, as well as regional and 

subregional organizations, can play in this regard and encouraging efforts to further 

enhance cooperation and implementation of the sanctions regime in all its aspects,  

 Noting with concern the reports that sanctioned individuals are travelling in the 

region in violation of the travel ban, and underlining that individuals or entities who 

knowingly facilitate the travel of a sanctioned individual in violation of the travel ban 

may be determined by the Committee to have met the designation criteria for 

sanctions,  

 Further noting with concern the reports that funds, financial assets and 

economic resources of listed individuals and entities have still not been frozen, and 

underlining the obligation of Member States and CAR authorities to do so without 

further delays, 

 Welcoming efforts by the Chair of the Committee and the President of the 

Security Council to support and strengthen the implementation of the measures 

imposed pursuant to resolution 2339 (2017) through engagement with Member States, 

especially regional States,  

 Determining that the situation in the CAR continues to constitute a threat to 

international peace and security in the region,  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 

  Arms embargo
