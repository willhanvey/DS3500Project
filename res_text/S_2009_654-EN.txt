and Eritrea, 

 Reaffirming that the Djibouti Agreement and Peace Process represent the basis 
for a resolution of the conflict in Somalia, and further reaffirming its support for the 
Transitional Federal Government (TFG), 

 Noting the decision of the 13th Assembly of the African Union (AU) in Sirte, 
Libya, calling on the Council to impose sanctions against foreign actors, both within 
and outside the region, especially Eritrea, providing support to the armed groups 
engaged in destabilization activities in Somalia and undermining the peace and 
reconciliation efforts as well as regional stability (S/2009/388),  

 Further noting the decision of the 13th Assembly of the AU in Sirte, Libya 
expressing its grave concern at the total absence of progress regarding the 
implementation by Eritrea of, inter alia, resolution 1862 (2009) regarding the border 
dispute between Djibouti and Eritrea (S/2009/388),  

 Expressing its grave concern at the findings of the Monitoring Group 
re-established by resolution 1853 (2008) as outlined in its December 2008 report 
(S/2008/769) that Eritrea has provided political, financial and logistical support to 
armed groups engaged in undermining peace and reconciliation in Somalia and 
regional stability, 

 Condemning all armed attacks on TFG officials and institutions, the civilian 
population, humanitarian workers and the African Union Mission to Somalia 
(AMISOM) personnel,

to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council 
(S/2009/256),  

 Recalling its resolution 1844 (2008) in which it decided to impose measures 
against individuals or entities designated as engaging in or providing support to acts 
that threaten peace, security and stability in Somalia, acting in violation of the arms 
embargo or obstructing the flow of humanitarian assistance to Somalia,  

 Expressing its appreciation of the contribution of AMISOM to the stability of 
Somalia, and further expressing its appreciation for the continued commitment to 
AMISOM by the Governments of Burundi and Uganda,  

 Reiterating its intention to take measures against those who seek to prevent or 
block the Djibouti Peace Process, 

 Expressing its deep concern that Eritrea has not withdrawn its forces to the 
status quo ante, as called for by the Security Council in its resolution 1862 (2009) 
and the statement of its President dated 12 June 2008 (S/PRST/2008/20),

dialogue with Djibouti, or to accept bilateral contacts, mediation or facilitation 
efforts by sub-regional or regional organizations or to respond positively to the 
efforts of the Secretary-General, 

 Taking note of the letter of the Secretary-General issued on 30 March 2009 
(S/2009/163), and the subsequent briefings by the Secretariat on the Djibouti-Eritrea
