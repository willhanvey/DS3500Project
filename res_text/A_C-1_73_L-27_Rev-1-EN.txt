 Noting that providing assistance, upon request, to build capacity in the area o f 

ICT security is essential for international security,  

 Affirming that capacity-building measures should seek to promote the use of 

ICTs for peaceful purposes, 

 Confirming that ICTs are dual-use technologies and can be used for both 

legitimate and malicious purposes, 

 Expressing concern that a number of States are developing ICT capabilities for 

military purposes and that the use of ICTs in future conflicts between States is 

becoming more likely, 

 Stressing that it is in the interest of all States to promote the use of ICTs for 

peaceful purposes, with the objective of shaping a community of shared future for 

humankind in cyberspace, and that States also have an interest in preventing conflict 

arising from the use of ICTs, 

 Noting that the United Nations should play a leading role in promoting dialogue 

among Member States to develop common understandings on the security of and the 

use of ICTs, as well as in developing common understandings on the application o f 

international law and norms, rules and principles for responsible State behaviour in 

this sphere, encourage regional efforts, promote confidence-building and 

transparency measures and support capacity-building and the dissemination of best 

practices, 

 Expressing concern that embedding harmful hidden functions in ICTs could be 

used in ways that would affect secure and reliable ICT use and the ICT supply chain 

for products and services, erode trust in commerce and damage national security,  

 Considering that it is necessary to prevent the use of information resources or 

technologies for criminal or terrorist purposes,  

 Underlining the importance of respect for human rights and fundamental 

freedoms in the use of ICTs, 

 Welcoming the effective work of the Group of Governmental Experts on 

Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of 

International Security and the relevant outcome reports transmitted by the Secretary -

General,1  

 Welcoming also that, in considering the application of international law to State 

use of ICTs, the Group of Governmental Experts, in its 2015 report, 2 identified as of 

central importance the commitments of States to the following principles of the 

Charter of the United Nations and other international law: sovereign equality; the 

settlement of international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that 

international peace and security and justice are not endangered; refraining in their 

international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity 

or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the 

purposes of the United Nations; respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; 

and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States,  

 Confirming the conclusions of the Group of Governmental Experts, in its 2013 3 

and 20152 reports, that international law, and in particular the Charter  of the United 

Nations, is applicable and essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting 

an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful ICT environment, that voluntary and

non-binding norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour of States in the use 

of ICTs can reduce risks to international peace, security and stability, and that, given 

the unique attributes of such technologies, additional norms can be developed over 

time, 

 Confirming also that State sovereignty and international norms and principles 

that flow from sovereignty apply to the State conduct of ICT-related activities and to 

their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory,  

 Reaffirming the right and duty of States to combat, within their constitutional 

prerogatives, the dissemination of false or distorted news, which can be interpreted 

as interference in the internal affairs of other States or as being harmful to the 

promotion of peace, cooperation and friendly relations among States and nations,  

 Recognizing the duty of a State to abstain from any defamatory campaign, 

vilification or hostile propaganda for the purpose of intervening or interfering in the 

internal affairs of other States,  

 Stressing that, while States have a primary responsibility for maintaining a 

secure and peaceful ICT environment, effective international cooperation would 

benefit from identifying mechanisms for the participation, as appropriate, of the 

private sector, academia and civil society organizations,  

 1. Welcomes the following set of international rules, norms and principles of 

responsible behaviour of States, enshrined in the reports of the Group of 

Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and 

Telecommunications in the Context of International Security of 2013 3 and 20152 

adopted by consensus and recommended in resolution 71/28 entitled “Developments 

in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international 

security”, adopted by the General Assembly on 5 December 2016:  

  1.1. Consistent with the purposes of the United Nations, including to maintain 

international peace and security, States should cooperate in developing and 

applying measures to increase stability and security in the use of ICTs and to 

prevent ICT practices that are acknowledged to be harmful or that may pose 

threats to international peace and security. 

 1.2. States must meet their international obligations regarding internationally 

wrongful acts attributable to them under international law. However, the 

indication that an ICT activity was launched or otherwise originates from the 

territory or objects of the ICT infrastructure of a State may be insufficient in 

itself to attribute the activity to that State. Accusations of organizing and 

implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated. In 

case of ICT incidents, States should consider all relevant information, including 

the larger context of the event, the challenges of attribution in the ICT 

environment and the nature and extent of the consequences.  

 1.3. States should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for 

internationally wrongful acts using ICTs. States must not use proxies to commit 

internationally wrongful acts using ICTs and should seek to ensure that their 

territory is not used by non-State actors to commit such acts.  

 1.4. States should consider how best to cooperate to exchange information, 

assist each other, prosecute terrorist and criminal use of ICTs and implement 

other cooperative measures to address such threats. States may need to consider 

whether new measures need to be developed in this respect.

A/C.1/73/L.27/Rev.1 
 

 

18-17859 4/5 

 

 1.5. States, in ensuring the secure use of ICTs, should respect Human Rights 

Council resolutions 20/8 of 5 July 20124  and 26/13 of 26 June 20145  on the 

promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet, as well as 

General Assembly resolutions 68/167 of 18 December 2013 and 69/166 of 

18 December 2014 on the right to privacy in the digital age, to guarantee full 

respect for human rights, including the right to freedom of expression.  

 1.6. A State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity contrary to 

its obligations under international law that intentionally damages critical 

infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical 

infrastructure to provide services to the public.  

 1.7. States should take appropriate measures to protect their critical 

infrastructure from ICT threats, taking into account General Assembly 

resolution 58/199 of 23 December 2003 on the creation of a global culture of 

cybersecurity and the protection of critical information infrastructures, and  

other relevant resolutions. 

 1.8. States should respond to appropriate requests for assistance by another 

State whose critical infrastructure is subject to malicious ICT acts. States should 

also respond to appropriate requests to mitigate malicious ICT activity aimed at 

the critical infrastructure of another State emanating from their territory, taking 

into account due regard for sovereignty.  

 1.9. States should take reasonable steps to ensure the integrity of the supply 

chain so that end users can have confidence in the security of ICT products. 

 1.10. States should seek to prevent the proliferation of malicious ICT tools and 

techniques and the use of harmful hidden functions.  

 1.11. States should encourage responsible reporting of ICT vulnerabilities and 

share associated information on available remedies for such vulnerabilities to 

limit and possibly eliminate potential threats to ICTs and ICT-dependent 

infrastructure. 

 1.12. States should not conduct or knowingly support activity to harm the 

information systems of the authorized emergency response teams (sometimes 

known as computer emergency response teams or cybersecurity incident 

response teams) of another State. A State should not use authorized emergency 

response teams to engage in malicious international activity. 

 1.13. States should encourage the private sector and civil society to play an 

appropriate role to improve security of and in the use of ICTs, including supply 

chain security for ICT products and services. States should cooperate with the 

private sector and the organizations of civil society in the sphere of 

implementation of rules of responsible behaviour in information space with  

regard to their potential role; 

 2. Calls upon Member States to promote further, at multilateral levels, the 

consideration of existing and potential threats in the field of information security, as 

well as possible strategies to address the threats emerging in this field, consistent with 

the need to preserve the free flow of information;

 3. Considers that the purpose of such measures could be served through 

further examination of relevant international concepts aimed at strengthening the 

security of global information and telecommunications systems;  

 4. Invites all Member States, taking into account the assessments and 

recommendations contained in the reports of the Group of Governmental Experts on 

Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of 

International Security,1 to continue to inform the Secretary-General of their views and 

assessments on the following questions:  

 (a) General appreciation of the issues of information security;  

 (b) Efforts taken at the national level to strengthen information security and 

promote international cooperation in this field;  

 (c) The content of the concepts mentioned in paragraph 3 above;  

 (d) Possible measures that could be taken by the international community to 

strengthen information security at the global level;  

 5. Decides to convene, beginning in 2019, with a view to making the United 

Nations negotiation process on security in the use of information and communications 

technologies more democratic, inclusive and transparent, an open-ended working 

group acting on a consensus basis, to continue, as a priority, to further develop the 

rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour of States listed in paragraph 1 

above, and the ways for their implementation; if necessary, to introduce changes to 

them or elaborate additional rules of behaviour; to study the possibility of establishing 

regular institutional dialogue with broad participation under the auspices of the 

United Nations; and to continue to study, with a view to promoting common 

understandings, existing and potential threats in the sphere of information security 

and possible cooperative measures to address them and how international law applies 

to the use of information and communications technologies by States, as well as 

confidence-building measures and capacity-building and the concepts referred to in 

paragraph 3 above, and to submit a report on the results of the study to the General 

Assembly at its seventy-fifth session, and to provide the possibility of holding, from 

within voluntary contributions, intersessional consul tative meetings with the 

interested parties, namely business, non-governmental organizations and academia, 

to share views on the issues within the group’s mandate; 

 6. Also decides that the open-ended working group shall hold its 

organizational session in June 2019 in order to agree on the organizational 

arrangements connected with the group;  

 7. Further decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-fourth 

session the item entitled “Developments in the field of information and 

telecommunications in the context of international security”.
