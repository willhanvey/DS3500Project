targeted and that they support developing countries in the face of financial, 

economic and development challenges;  

 13. Notes, in this regard, the increase in resources and the improvement of 

the lending framework of the International Monetary Fund through, inter alia, 

streamlined conditions and flexible instruments, such as the precautionary and 

liquidity line, the flexible credit line and the rapid financing instrument, and the 

refinement of the lending framework for low-income countries, while also noting 

that new and ongoing programmes should not contain unwarranted procyclical 

conditionalities; 

 14. Encourages, in this regard, the multilateral development banks to 

continue to move forward on flexible, concessional, fast -disbursing and front-loaded

at the annual meetings of the Fund and the Group in 2019, emphasizes that the new 

quota formula, as a basis for a realignment of quota shares, will result in increased 

shares for dynamic economies in line with their relative positions in the world 

economy and hence likely in the share of emerging market and developing countries

enhanced global economic governance, and that processes to develop and facilitate 

the availability of appropriate knowledge and technologies globally, as well as

an enabling environment for sustainable development at all levels and by all actors, 

and to reinvigorating the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development;  

 24. Recommits to a redoubling of its efforts to substantially curb illicit 

financial flows by 2030, with a view to eventually eliminating them, including by

the broader use of special drawing rights in enhancing the resilience of the

of troubled, systemically important financial institutions;  

 28. Reiterates that effective, inclusive multilateral surveillance should be at 

the centre of crisis prevention efforts, stresses the need to continue to strengthen 

surveillance of the financial policies of countries, and in this regard notes the 

current efforts to update the surveillance approach of the International Monetary 

Fund to better integrate bilateral and multilateral surveillance, along with cross -

border and cross-sectoral linkages with macroeconomic and macroprudential 

policies, while paying closer attention to the spillover effects from national 

economic and financial policies onto the global economy;  

 29. Also reiterates the need to resolve to reduce mechanistic reliance on 

credit-rating agency assessments, including in regulations and to promote increased 

competition as well as measures to avoid conflict of interest in the provision of 

credit ratings; 

 30. Invites the international financial and banking institutions to continue to 

enhance the transparency of risk-rating mechanisms, noting that sovereign risk 

assessments should maximize the use of objective and transparent parameters, 

which can be facilitated by high-quality data and analysis, and encourages relevant 

institutions, including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, to 

continue their work on the issue, including the potential impact of the role played by 

private credit rating agencies on the development prospects of developing countries, 

in accordance with their mandates; 

 31. Welcomes efforts by new development banks to develop safeguard 

systems in open consultation with stakeholders on the basis of established 

international standards, and encourages all development banks to establish or 

maintain social and environmental safeguard systems, including on human rights, 

gender equality and women’s empowerment, that are transparent, effective, efficient 

and time-sensitive; 

 32. Recognizes the need for the international financial institutions, as 

appropriate, to promote gender mainstreaming in their policies and programmes, 



 
A/C.2/72/L.19/Rev.1 

 

9/9 17-20876 

 

including macroeconomic, job creation and structural reform policies and 

programmes, in accordance with relevant national priorities and strategies; 

 33. Urges multilateral donors, and invites international financial institutions 

and regional development banks, within their respective mandates, to review and 

implement policies that support national efforts to ensure that a higher pro portion of 

resources reaches women and girls, in particular in rural and remote areas;  

 34. Recommits itself to enabling women’s full and equal participation in the 

economy and their equal access to decision-making processes and leadership; 

 35. Reiterates that States are strongly urged to refrain from promulgating and 

applying any unilateral economic, financial or trade measures not in accordance 

with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that impede the full 

achievement of economic and social development, particularly in developing 

countries;
13

 

 36. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its 

seventy-third session a report on the implementation of the present resolution to be 

prepared with input from the major institutional stakeholders, including the 

International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the United Nations Conference 

on Trade and Development, in accordance with their respective mandates;  

 37. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-third session, 

under the item entitled “Macroeconomic policy questions”, the sub -item entitled 

“International financial system and development”, unless otherwise agreed.
