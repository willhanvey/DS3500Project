Reaffirming that everyone is entitled to a social and international order in
which the rights and freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights2 can be fully realized,

Also reaffirming the determination expressed in the Preamble to the Charter of
the United Nations to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, to
establish conditions under which justice and respect for obligations arising from
treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, to promote social
progress and better standards of life in larger freedom, to practise tolerance and
good-neighbourliness, and to employ international machinery for the promotion of
the economic and social advancement of all peoples,

Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the
aspirations of all the peoples for an international order based on the principles
enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, including promoting and
encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and respect
for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, peace,
democracy, justice, equality, the rule of law, pluralism, development, better
standards of living and solidarity,

Also considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims
that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone
is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein, without distinction of any
kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national
or social origin, property, birth or other status,

Reaffirming that democracy, development and respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing, and that
democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own
political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in all
aspects of their lives,

Emphasizing that democracy is not only a political concept but also has
economic and social dimensions,

Recognizing that democracy, respect for all human rights, including the right to
development, transparent and accountable governance and administration in all
sectors of society, and effective participation by civil society are an essential part of
the necessary foundations for the realization of social- and people-centred
sustainable development,

Underlining that it is imperative for the international community to ensure that
globalization becomes a positive force for all the world’s people, and that only
through broad and sustained efforts, based upon common humanity in all its
diversity, can globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable,

Stressing that efforts to make globalization fully inclusive and equitable must
include policies and measures, at the global level, which correspond to the needs of
developing countries and economies in transition and are formulated and
implemented with their effective participation,

Resolved on the eve of a new century and millennium to take all measures
within its power to secure a democratic and equitable international order,
