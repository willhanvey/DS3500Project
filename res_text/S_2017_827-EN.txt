 The Security Council, 

 Recalling resolution 2240 (2015), resolution 2312 (2016) and Presidential 

Statement 2015/25, 

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, 

territorial integrity and national unity of Libya,  

 Welcoming the Secretary-General’s report S/2017/761, 

 Recalling that international law, as reflected in the United Nations Convention 

on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982, sets out the legal framework applicable 

to activities in the ocean, 

 Reaffirming also the United Nations Convention against Transnational 

Organized Crime (UNTOC Convention) and its Protocol against the Smuggling of 

Migrants by Land, Air and Sea, as the primary international legal instruments to 

combat the smuggling of migrants and related conduct, and the Protocol to Prevent, 

Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, 

supplementing the UNTOC Convention, as the primary international legal 

instruments to combat trafficking in persons,  

 Underlining that, although the crime of smuggling of migrants may share, in 

some cases, some common features with the crime of trafficking in persons, 

Member States need to recognize that they are distinct crimes, as defined by the 

UNTOC Convention and its Protocols, requiring differing legal, operational, and 

policy responses, 

 Deploring the continuing maritime tragedies in the Mediterranean Sea that 

have resulted in thousands of casualties, and noting with concern that such 

casualties were, in some cases, the result of exploitation and misinformation by 

transnational criminal organizations which facilitated the illegal smuggling of 

migrants via dangerous methods for personal gain and with callous disregard for 

human life, 

 Expressing grave concern at the ongoing proliferation of, and endangerment of 

lives by, the smuggling of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, in particular off the

coast of Libya and reiterating that among these migrants may be persons who meet 

the definition of a refugee under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of 

Refugees and the 1967 Protocol thereto,  

 Emphasizing in this respect that migrants, including asylum seekers and 

regardless of their migration status, should be treated with humanity and dignity and 

that their rights should be fully respected, and urging all States in this regard to 

comply with their obligations under international law, including international human 

rights law and international refugee law, as applicable, stressing also the obligation 

of States, where applicable, to protect the human rights of migrants regardless of 

their migration status, including when implementing their specific migration and 

border security policies, 

 Reaffirming in this respect the need to promote and protect effectively the 

human rights and fundamental freedoms of all migrants, regardless of their 

migration status, especially those of women and children, and to address 

international migration through international, regional or bilateral cooperation and 

dialogue and through a comprehensive and balanced approach, recognizing the roles 

and responsibilities of countries of origin, transit and destination in promoting and 

protecting the human rights of all migrants, and avoiding approaches that might 

aggravate their vulnerability, 

 Further recalling the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 

and the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue,  

 Expressing further concern that the situation in Libya is exacerbated by the 

smuggling of migrants and human trafficking into, through and from the Libyan 

territory, which could provide support to other organized crime and terrorist 

networks in Libya, 

 Mindful of its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international 

peace and security under the Charter of the United Nations,  

 Underlining the primary responsibility of the Government of National Accord 

to take appropriate action to prevent the recent proliferation of, and endangerment 

of lives by, the smuggling of migrants and human trafficking through the territory of 

Libya and its territorial sea, 

 Mindful of the need to support further efforts to strengthen Libyan border 

management, considering the difficulties of the Government of National Accord to 

manage effectively the migratory flows in transit through Libyan territory, and  

noting its concern for the repercussions of this phenomenon on the stability of Libya 

and of the Mediterranean region,  

 Welcoming ongoing support by the most concerned Member States, including 

Member States of the European Union (EU), taking into account inter alia the role 

of FRONTEX and the specific mandate of EUBAM Libya in support of the 

Government of National Accord, and by neighbouring States,  

 Acknowledging the European Council Conclusions of 23 June 2017 and the 

press statement of the African Union Peace and Security Council of 16 February 

2016 which underlined the need for effective international action to address both the 

immediate and long-term aspects of illegal migration and human trafficking towards 

Europe, 

 Taking note of the Decision of the Council of the European Union of 25 July 

2017 to extend the mandate of EUNAVFOR Med Operation Sophia until 

31 December 2018, 



 
S/2017/827 

 

3/5 17-17546 

 

 Taking further note of the ongoing discussions between the EU and the 

Government of National Accord on migration-related issues, 

 Expressing also strong support to the States in the region affected by the 

smuggling of migrants and human trafficking and emphasizing the need to step up 

coordination of efforts in order to strengthen an effective multidimensional response 

to these common challenges in the spirit of international solidarity and shared 

responsibility, to tackle their root causes and to prevent people from being exploited 

by migrant smugglers and human traffickers,  

 Acknowledging the need to assist States in the region, upon request, in the 

development of comprehensive and integrated regional and national strategies, legal 

frameworks, and institutions to counter terrorism, transnational organized crime, 

migrant smuggling, and human trafficking, including mechanisms to implement 

them within the framework of States’ obligations under applicable international law,  

 Stressing that addressing both migrant smuggling and human trafficking, 

including dismantling smuggling and trafficking networks in the region and 

prosecuting migrant smugglers, and human traffickers requires a coordinated, 

multidimensional approach with States of origin, of transit, and of destination, and 

further acknowledging the need to develop effective strategies to deter migrant 

smuggling and human trafficking in States of origin and transit,  

 Emphasizing that migrants should be treated with humanity and dignity and 

that their rights should be fully respected, and urging all States in this regard to 

comply with their obligations under international law, including international human 

rights law and international refugee law, as applicable,  

 Bearing in mind the obligations of States under applicable international law to 

exercise due diligence to prevent and combat migrant  smuggling and human 

trafficking, to investigate and punish perpetrators, to identify and provide effective 

assistance to victims of trafficking and migrants and to cooperate to the fullest 

extent possible to prevent and suppress migrant smuggling and huma n trafficking, 

 Reaffirming the necessity to put an end to the ongoing proliferation of, and 

endangerment of lives by, the smuggling of migrants and trafficking of persons in 

the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Libya, and, for these specific purposes, 

acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 1. Condemns all acts of migrant smuggling and human trafficking into, 

through and from the Libyan territory and off the coast of Libya, which undermine

 2. Reiterates its calls on Member States acting nationally or through 

regional organizations, including the EU, to cooperate with the Government of 

National Accord and with each other, including by sharing information to assist

to prevent, investigate and prosecute acts of smuggling of migrants and human 

trafficking through its territory and in its territorial  sea; in order to prevent the 

further proliferation of, and endangerment of lives by, the smuggling of migrants 

and human trafficking into, through and from the territory of Libya and off its coast;  

 3. Urges Member States and regional organizations, in the spirit of 

international solidarity and shared responsibility, to cooperate with the Government

the high seas off the coast of Libya, and rendering assistance to migrants and 

victims of human trafficking recovered at sea, in accordance with international law;
