(S/2015/590), updating the Security Council on progress made by the Government

effective monitoring and management of the border regions between Liberia and 

Côte d’Ivoire,  

 Commending the Government of Liberia for responding effectively to the 

Ebola outbreak in Liberia and recognizing, in this regard, the resilience of the

Armed Forces of Liberia and the Liberia National Police,  

 Welcoming the efforts of Member States, bilateral partners and multilateral 

organizations, including the United Nations, African Union (AU) and Economic

resources is critical for Liberia’s sustainable peace and security,
