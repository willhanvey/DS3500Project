international peace and security, and expressing its strong concern about the security 
situation in Afghanistan, in particular the ongoing violent and terrorist activities by 
the Taliban, Al-Qaida, illegal armed groups, criminals and those involved in the 
narcotics trade, and the strong links between terrorism activities and illicit drugs,

Afghanistan’s offer of reconciliation,  

 Taking note of the Government of Afghanistan’s request that the Security
