 Bearing in mind its resolution 65/118 of 10 December 2010 on the fiftieth 

anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial 

Countries and Peoples, reiterating its view that it is incumbent on the United 

Nations to continue to play an active role in the process of decolonization, and 

noting that the process of decolonization is not yet complete,  

 Recalling its resolution 65/119 of 10 December 2010, in which it declared the
