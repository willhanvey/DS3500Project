CHAPTER I

November 1961. The Special Committee was requested to examine the application of
the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples,
contained in Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, and to make
suggestions and recommendations on the progress and extent of the implementation
of the Declaration.

2. At its seventeenth session, after considering the report of the Special
Committee, 1/ the General Assembly adopted resolution 1810 (XVII) of
17 December 1962, by which it enlarged the Special Committee with the addition of
seven new members. It invited the Committee "to continue to seek the most suitable
ways and means for the speedy and total application of the Declaration to all
Territories which have not yet attained independence".

3. At the same session, by its resolution 1805 (XVII) of 14 December 1962 on the
question of South West Africa, the General Assembly requested the Special
Committee to discharge, mutatis mutandis, the tasks assigned to the Special
Committee for South West Africa by resolution 1702 (XVI) of 19 December 1961. By
its resolution 1806 (XVII) of 14 December 1962, the Assembly decided to dissolve

It also requested the Committee to take that information fully into account in
examining the situation with regard to the implementation of the Declaration in
each of the Non-Self-Governing Territories and to undertake any special study and
prepare any special report it might consider necessary.

5. At the same session and at each subsequent session, the General Assembly,

20 November 1990, containing a series of recommendations with a view to
facilitating the speedy implementation of the Declaration.

7. At its forty-sixth session, the General Assembly, by adopting resolution
46/181 of 19 December 1991, endorsed as a plan of action for the International
Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism the proposals contained in the annex to

"(b) Review the impact of the economic and social situation on the
constitutional and political advancement of Non-Self-Governing Territories;

"(c) Organize during the Decade seminars in the Caribbean and Pacific

organizations, specialized agencies, non-governmental organizations and
experts.

"23. The Special Committee should continue to seek, as a matter of priority,
the full cooperation of administering Powers with regard to the dispatch of
United Nations visiting missions to Non-Self-Governing Territories.

"24. The Special Committee, with the cooperation of the administering Powers,
should make every effort to facilitate and encourage the participation of
representatives of Non-Self-Governing Territories in regional and
international organizations, as well as in the specialized agencies of the
United Nations system, the Special Committee itself and other United Nations
decolonization bodies."

8. At its fiftieth session, after considering the report of the Special
Committee, 3/ the General Assembly, on 6 December 1995, adopted resolution 50/39,
in which it, inter alia:

"5. Approves the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with

"...

"11. Requests the Special Committee to continue to seek suitable means
for the immediate and full implementation of the Declaration and to carry out

Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism in all Territories that have not

enable the populations of those Territories to exercise their right to

"(d) To take all necessary steps to enlist worldwide support among
Governments, as well as national and international organizations, for the
achievement of the objectives of the Declaration and the implementation of
the relevant resolutions of the United Nations;

the Special Committee in the discharge of its mandate and to receive visiting
missions to the Territories to secure first-hand information and ascertain
the wishes and aspirations of their inhabitants;

"13. Also calls upon the administering Powers that have not participated
in the work of the Special Committee to do so at its 1996 session;".

and adopted decisions as indicated below.

2. Subsidiary bodies

16 February 1996

30. At its 1454th meeting, on 16 February, on the recommendation of its Chairman,
the Special Committee established an open-ended Working Group with responsibility
for making recommendations on how to improve further the efficiency of the work of
the Special Committee, with the same composition and mandate as the Working Group
of 1995.

31. The open-ended Working Group of 1995 was composed of all members of the
Special Committee and was open to any State Member of the United Nations.
Administering Powers, in particular, as well as representatives of
Non-Self-Governing Territories, were encouraged to participate.

32. During the period covered by the present report, the open-ended Working Group
held one meeting and submitted one report (A/AC.109/L.1842).

(c) Subcommittee on Small Territories, Petitions, Information and Assistance

33. At its 1454th meeting, on 16 February, the Special Committee decided to

Assistance, consisting of the entire membership of the Special Committee.

34. At the same meeting, the Special Committee elected Mr. Utula Utuoc Samana
(Papua New Guinea) as Chairman and Ms. Roslyn Lauren Khan-Cummings (Trinidad and
Tobago) as Vice-Chairman/Rapporteur of the Subcommittee.

35. The Subcommittee held seven meetings between 26 June and 8 July and submitted
one report (A/AC.109/L.1843), which the Special Committee considered at its 1456th
meeting, on 22 July.

36. An account of the Special Committee’s consideration of the report of the
Subcommittee relating to (a) American Samoa, Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin
Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guam, Montserrat, Pitcairn, St. Helena, Tokelau, the
Turks and Caicos Islands and the United States Virgin Islands and (b)
dissemination of information on decolonization is contained in chapters X and III,
respectively, of the present report.

E. Question of the list of Territories to which the
Declaration is applicable

37. At its 1454th meeting, on 16 February, by adopting the suggestions put
forward by the Chairman relating to the organization of its work
(A/AC.109/L.1841), the Special Committee decided to allocate the question of the
list of Territories to which the Declaration is applicable to the Working Group as
appropriate. In taking that decision, the Committee recalled that, in its report
to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session, 5/ it had stated that, subject to
any directives that the Assembly might wish to give in that connection, it would
continue, as part of its programme of work for 1996, to review the list of
Territories to which the Declaration applied. The Committee further recalled
that, by paragraph 5 of resolution 50/39, the Assembly had approved the report of
the Special Committee, including the programme of work envisaged by the Committee
for 1996.

38. At its 1464th meeting, on 26 July, the Special Committee considered the
question on the basis of the recommendations contained in the 103rd report of the
Working Group (A/AC.109/L.1852). The relevant paragraph of that report reads as

-9-



follows:

"11. The Working Group decided to recommend that the Special Committee
continue consideration of the question at its next session, subject to any
directives that the General Assembly might give at its fifty-first session."

39. At the same meeting, the Special Committee approved the recommendation of the
Working Group.

Special Committee decision of 15 August 1991 concerning
Puerto Rico 6/

40. At its 1454th meeting, on 16 February, by adopting the suggestions put
forward by the Chairman relating to the organization of its work
(A/AC.109/L.1841), the Special Committee decided to take up as appropriate an item
entitled "Special Committee decision of 15 August 1991 concerning Puerto Rico" and
to consider it in plenary meetings.

41. At its 1461st meeting, on 24 July, on the proposal of the Bureau, the Special
Committee decided to extend the postponement of the item until 1997 and to give due
consideration to requests for hearing on the basis of its usual practice.

42. At the 1462nd meeting, on 25 July, the Chairman drew attention to a number of
communications received from organizations expressing the wish to be heard on
Puerto Rico by the Special Committee. On the basis of the decision it had taken at
its 1461st meeting, the Committee agreed to accede to those requests and, at the
1462nd and 1463rd meetings, heard the representatives of the organizations
concerned, as indicated below:

F. Consideration of other matters

1. Matters relating to the small Territories

43. At its 1454th meeting, on 16 February, by adopting the suggestions put
forward by the Chairman relating to the organization of its work (ibid.), the
Special Committee decided to include in its agenda an item entitled "Matters
relating to the small Territories" and to consider it in plenary meetings and at
meetings of the Subcommittee on Small Territories, Petitions, Information and
Assistance.

44. In taking those decisions, the Special Committee took into account the
provisions of the relevant General Assembly resolutions, including resolution
50/39, by paragraph 11 (c) of which the Assembly requested the Special Committee to
continue to pay special attention to the small Territories, in particular through
the dispatch of regular visiting missions, and to recommend to the Assembly the
most suitable steps to be taken to enable the populations of those Territories to
exercise their right to self-determination and independence.

45. During the year, the Special Committee and its Subcommittee gave extensive
consideration to all phases of the situation obtaining in the small Territories
(see chaps. IX-XI of the present report).

2. Compliance of Member States with the Declaration and
other resolutions on decolonization

46. At its 1454th meeting, on 16 February, by adopting the suggestions put
forward by the Chairman relating to the organization of its work
(A/AC.109/L.1841), the Special Committee decided to consider at its plenary
meetings and at meetings of the Subcommittee on Small Territories, Petitions,
Information and Assistance the question of compliance of Member States with the
Declaration and other resolutions on decolonization.

47. The Special Committee and its Subcommittee accordingly took that decision
into account in their consideration of specific items.

3. Question of holding a series of meetings
away from Headquarters

48. At its 1454th meeting, on 16 February, by adopting the suggestions put
forward by the Chairman relating to the organization of its work (ibid.), the
Special Committee decided to take up the question of holding a series of meetings
away from Headquarters, as appropriate, and to refer it to its Working Group for
consideration and recommendations.

49. Having regard to its programme of work for 1997, the Special Committee, at its
1464th meeting, on 26 July, considered the question of holding meetings away from
Headquarters, taking into account the provisions of paragraph 6 of General
Assembly resolution 1654 (XVI) of 27 November 1961 and paragraph 3 (9) of
resolution 2621 (XXV) of 12 October 1970, by which the Assembly authorized the
Special Committee to meet elsewhere than at United Nations Headquarters whenever
and wherever such meetings might be required for the effective discharge of its

-11-



functions. Also at its 1464th meeting, by approving the recommendations contained
in the 103rd report of its Working Group (A/AC.109/L.1852), the Committee decided
that it would consider accepting such invitations as might be received in 1997 in
connection with the above question, and that, when particulars of such meetings
had become known, it would request the Secretary-General to seek the necessary
budgetary provision in accordance with established procedure.

4. Pattern of conferences

50. At its 1454th meeting, on 16 February, by adopting the suggestions put
forward by the Chairman relating to the organization of its work
(A/AC.109/L.1841), the Special Committee decided to take up, as appropriate, an
item entitled "Pattern of conferences" and to refer it to its Working Group for
consideration and recommendations. In so doing, the Committee was conscious of
the fact that it had initiated some important measures in rationalizing its work
methods, many of which were subsequently incorporated in a number of resolutions
and decisions of the General Assembly. Further recalling the measures it had taken
theretofore in that connection, the Committee decided to continue to exercise its
initiatives in the effective utilization of the limited conference resources and
the further reduction of its documentation requirements.

51. The Special Committee also continued the practice of circulating
communications and information material, as far as possible, in the form of
informal notes and aides-mémoires in the original language of submission, thus
curtailing documentation requirements and accruing considerable savings for the
Organization. A list of the official documents issued by the Special Committee in
1996 is contained in the annex to the present chapter.

52. At its 1464th meeting, on 26 July, the Special Committee considered the item
on the basis of the recommendations contained in the 103rd report of the Working
Group (A/AC.109/L.1852). The relevant paragraphs of that report read as follows:

"5. The Working Group noted that, during the year, the Special Committee had
closely followed the guidelines set forth in the resolutions of the General
Assembly on the pattern of conferences, in particular resolution 50/206 of 23
December 1995. By organizing its programme of work effectively, holding
extensive consultations, working in informal sessions and streamlining the
work of the Subcommittee on Small Territories, Petitions, Information and
Assistance, which had had a shorter session than in previous years, the
Committee had been able to curtail considerably the number of its formal
meetings. The Working Group recommended that the Special Committee continue
to make optimum and effective use of conference-servicing resources.

"6. The Working Group decided to recommend that, taking into account the
probable workload of the Special Committee for 1997, the Committee consider
holding its meetings in accordance with the following schedule:

(a) Plenary

February/June As required

July Up to 20 meetings (6-8 meetings a week)

(b) Subsidiary bodies

May/June 15 meetings (1-4 meetings a week)

-12-



"7. It was understood that that programme would not preclude the holding of
any ad hoc meetings that might be warranted and that the Special Committee
might, in early 1997, review the scheduled meetings on the basis of any new
developments. The Working Group recommended that, subject to any directives
given by the General Assembly, the Special Committee, while fulfilling its
mandate, should strive to keep its meetings to a minimum."

53. At the same meeting, the Special Committee approved the recommendations.

5. Control and limitation of documentation

54. At its 1464th meeting, on 26 July, the Special Committee considered the
question of control and limitation of documentation on the basis of
recommendations contained in the 103rd report of the Working Group (ibid.). The
relevant paragraphs of that report read as follows:

"8. The Working Group noted that, during the year, the Special Committee had
taken further measures to control and limit its documentation in compliance
with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, in particular
resolutions 34/50 of 23 November 1979, 39/68 of 13 December 1984 and 50/206 B
of 23 December 1995. The Working Group recommended that, consistent with the
goal of limiting documentation, the Special Committee streamline its report
to the General Assembly.

"9. By its resolution 50/206 B, the General Assembly approved the
recommendation of the Special Committee to replace its verbatim records by
summary records. Having reviewed the need for such records, the Working
Group decided to recommend to the Special Committee that it maintain its
summary records.

"10. The Working Group noted with concern the decision of the Department of
Public Information to suspend its coverage of the Special Committee and its
subsidiary body and recommended to the Special Committee that it urge the
General Assembly to request the Department to resume full coverage of the
activities of the Special Committee."

55. At the same meeting, the Special Committee approved the recommendations.

6. Cooperation and participation of the administering Powers
in the work of the Special Committee

56. In compliance with the provisions of the relevant resolutions of the General
Assembly, the delegations of New Zealand and Portugal, as representatives of the
administering Powers concerned, continued to participate, in accordance with
established procedure, in the related work of the Special Committee, as reflected
in chapters IX, X and XI of the present report.

57. The delegations of France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland and the United States of America did not participate in the work of the
Special Committee. 7/

58. In a related context, the Special Committee, at its 1461st meeting, on
24 July, adopted draft resolution A/AC.109/L.1849, as amended, on the question of
sending visiting missions to Territories. By that resolution (see para. 140), the
Special Committee noted with appreciation that, at the invitation of the

-13-



Government of New Zealand, a visiting mission had been dispatched to Tokelau in
July 1994. It called upon the administering Powers to cooperate or continue to
cooperate with the United Nations by receiving United Nations visiting missions in
the Territories under their administration.

7. Participation of representatives of Non-Self-Governing
Territories in the work of the Special Committee

59. At its 1464th meeting, on 26 July, the Special Committee considered the
question of the participation of representatives of Non-Self-Governing Territories
in its work on the basis of recommendations contained in the 103rd report of the
Working Group (A/AC.109/L.1852). The relevant paragraph of that report reads as
follows:

"14. The Working Group decided to recommend that the participation of
representatives of Non-Self-Governing Territories in the work of the Special
Committee at Headquarters, as recommended by the Plan of Action for the
International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, continue to be
facilitated through the reimbursement by the United Nations of the expenses
relating to their participation under the terms of the guidelines amended by
the Committee and approved by the General Assembly at its forty-eighth
session. In that regard, the Working Group decided to recommend that the
Special Committee consider the guidelines at its plenary meetings with a view
to amending them further, where appropriate."

60. At the same meeting, the Special Committee approved the recommendation.

8. Week of Solidarity with the Peoples of All Colonial
Territories Fighting for Freedom, Independence and

Human Rights

61. Under the terms of General Assembly resolution 2911 (XXVII) of
2 November 1972, by paragraph 2 of which the Assembly recommended that, "on the
occasion of the Week, ... appropriate materials should be published in the press
and broadcast on radio and television and public campaigns should be conducted
with a view to obtaining contributions to the Assistance Fund for the Struggle
against Colonialism ...", and as reflected in the report of the Subcommittee on
Small Territories, Petitions, Information and Assistance relating to the question
of dissemination of information on decolonization (A/AC.109/L.1843), the
representative of the Vice-Chairman (Cuba) made a statement on 14 June at the
Pacific Regional Seminar, held at Port Moresby from 12 to 14 June 1996, in
commemoration of the Week (see para. 121).

9. Representation at seminars, meetings and conferences of
intergovernmental and other organizations

62. At its 1464th meeting, on 26 July, the Special Committee considered the
following recommendation contained in the 103rd report of the Working Group
(A/AC.109/L.1852):

"4. The Working Group proposed that the Special Committee recommend to the
General Assembly that the Committee continue to be represented at seminars,
meetings and conferences organized by United Nations bodies and other
intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations active in the field of

-14-



decolonization. In keeping with its decision of 16 February 1996, the
Committee would authorize its Chairman to hold consultations, as appropriate,
concerning its participation in those meetings, as well as the level of
representation, when accepting invitations. In accordance with established
practice, the Chairman would hold consultations with the Bureau members who,
in turn, would consult with the members of the Committee from their
respective regional groups. The Working Group also recommended that the
General Assembly make appropriate budgetary provisions to cover such
activities in 1997."

63. At the same meeting, the Special Committee approved the recommendation.

10. Integration of the Subcommittee on Small Territories,
Petitions, Information and Assistance with the

Special Committee

64. The proposal for integration of the Subcommittee on Small Territories,
Petitions, Information and Assistance with the Special Committee, which was made
by the delegation of Papua New Guinea (see para. 17 above), was discussed by the
Special Committee at its 1454th, 1455th and 1464th meetings, on 16 February,
4 April and 26 July, respectively. The Committee considered the question on the
basis of the recommendation contained in the 103rd report of the Working Group
(A/AC.109/L.1852), the relevant paragraph of which reads as follows:

"15. The Working Group may recall that the proposal for integration, which
was made by the delegation of Papua New Guinea, was discussed at length by the
open-ended Working Group of the Special Committee on 29 March 1996. It was
felt that, for further consideration, the delegation of Papua New Guinea
should prepare a written proposal comparing the mandates and functions of the
Special Committee and its subsidiary body. The delegation of Papua New
Guinea submitted the written proposal on the question of integration. The
Working Group addressed the issue and decided to recommend to the Special
Committee that it defer any action in this regard until further examination
of the proposal during the next session of the Special Committee, in 1997."

65. At its 1464th meeting, the Special Committee approved the recommendation.

11. Report of the Special Committee to the General Assembly

66. At its 1454th meeting, on 16 February, by adopting the suggestions put
forward by the Chairman relating to the organization of its work (A/AC.109/L.1841)
and in accordance with paragraph 31 of General Assembly decision 34/401, on the
rationalization of the procedures and organization of the Assembly, the Special
Committee decided to follow the procedure adopted at its 1995 session 8/ in
connection with the formulation of its recommendations to the Assembly at its
fifty-first session.

67. At its 1456th meeting, on 22 July, the Special Committee decided to authorize
its Rapporteur to prepare and submit directly to the General Assembly the various
chapters of the report of the Special Committee in accordance with established
practice and procedure.

12. Other questions

-15-



68. At its 1454th meeting, on 16 February, by adopting the suggestions put
forward by the Chairman relating to the organization of its work (ibid.), the
Special Committee decided to request the Subcommittee on Small Territories,
Petitions, Information and Assistance, in its examination of specific Territories,

decisions listed in the note by the Secretary-General on the organization of work
of the Special Committee (A/AC.109/L.1840, paras. 11 and 12).

69. That decision was taken into account during the consideration at both
Subcommittee and plenary meetings of specific Territories and of other items.

the Special Committee in 1991, which brought about a number of changes and
improvements in its approach, methods and procedures, were again pursued in 1996.
The measures adopted by the Committee included the streamlining and consolidation
of a number of its resolutions. With regard to the preparation of the consolidated
draft resolution, it was recommended that extensive consultations should be held
with the administering Powers concerned and with representatives of
Non-Self-Governing Territories and that all administering Powers concerned should
be urged to cooperate fully with the Special Committee. As in previous years, the
Committee’s recommendation to the General Assembly at its fifty-first session on
12 Territories was consolidated into a single resolution (see paras. 235 and 236).

86. The Special Committee also reviewed its resolutions on the question of
sending visiting missions to Territories (A/AC.109/2067), information from
Non-Self-Governing Territories transmitted under Article 73 e of the Charter of
the United Nations (A/AC.109/2061), activities of foreign economic and other
interests which impede the implementation of the Declaration in Territories under
colonial domination (A/AC.109/2064) and implementation of the Declaration by the
specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United

-18-



Nations (A/AC.109/2070), as well as its decision on military activities and
arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their administration
(A/AC.109/2065).

87. As noted in chapter II of the present report, the Special Committee held a
regional seminar in Papua New Guinea in June 1996 in implementation of the Plan of
Action for the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism adopted by
the General Assembly in its resolution 46/181 of 19 December 1991.

88. In accordance with the mandate entrusted to it by the General Assembly, the
Special Committee continued to seek suitable means for the implementation of
resolution 1514 (XV) in all Territories to which the Declaration is applicable and
formulated specific proposals and recommendations in that regard.

89. On the question of the publicity to be given to the work of the United Nations
in the field of decolonization, the Special Committee adopted a resolution
(A/AC.109/2063) which it recommended to the General Assembly for action at its
fifty-first session (see para. 122).

90. The Special Committee also continued its review of the list of Territories to
which the Declaration is applicable. With regard to its decision of 15 August 1991
concerning Puerto Rico, the Committee decided to defer consideration of that
decision until 1997. However, in accordance with the recommendation of the
Bureau, endorsed by the Committee at its 1461st meeting, on 24 July, it heard
statements by representatives of organizations concerned.

91. In accordance with the guidelines established by the General Assembly, the
Special Committee was able during the year to reduce to a minimum the number of its
formal meetings and to minimize the wastage resulting from cancellation of
scheduled meetings.

J. Future work

92. In accordance with the mandate entrusted to it in the relevant General
Assembly resolutions, and subject to any further directives which it may receive
from the Assembly during its fifty-first session, the Special Committee intends
during 1997 to pursue its efforts in seeking the best ways and means for the
implementation of the Declaration in all Territories that have not yet attained
independence. In particular, the Committee will keep under review developments
concerning each Territory, as well as the compliance by all States, in particular
the administering Powers, with the relevant decisions and resolutions of the
United Nations. On the basis of that review, the Committee will continue to submit
conclusions and recommendations on the specific measures necessary to achieve the
objectives set out in the Declaration and the relevant provisions of the Charter.
The Committee also intends to continue its review of the list of Territories to
which the Declaration is applicable.

93. The Special Committee will continue to fulfil the responsibilities that have
been entrusted to it in the context of the Plan of Action for the International
Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism approved by the General Assembly in its
resolution 46/181. The activities to be undertaken in this connection include a
seminar in the Caribbean region to be organized by the Special Committee in 1997,
to be attended by the representatives of all Non-Self-Governing Territories.

94. The Special Committee will continue to pay special attention to the specific
problems of the small island Territories which constitute the overwhelming

-19-



majority of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories. Aware that, in addition
to general problems facing developing countries, those island Territories also
suffer handicaps arising from the interplay of such factors as size, remoteness,
geographical dispersion, vulnerability to natural disasters, fragility of
ecosystems, constraints in transport and communications, great distances from
market centres, a highly limited internal market, lack of natural resources, weak
indigenous technological capacity, the acute problem of obtaining freshwater
supplies, heavy dependence on imports and a small number of commodities, depletion
of non-renewable resources, migration, particularly of personnel with high-level
skills, shortage of administrative personnel and heavy financial burdens, the
Special Committee will continue to recommend measures to facilitate a sustained
and balanced growth of the fragile economies of those Territories and increased
assistance in the development of all the sectors of their economies, with
particular emphasis on programmes of diversification. In so doing, the Committee
will continue to take into consideration the recommendations of the regional
seminars that it has organized since 1990 (see A/AC.109/1040 and Corr.1,
A/AC.109/1043, A/AC.109/1114, A/AC.109/1159, A/AC.109/2030 and A/AC.109/2058).

95. It is the Special Committee’s intention to continue to follow closely the
implementation of the Declaration by the specialized agencies and the
international institutions associated with the United Nations. In so doing, the
Committee, as in the past, will review the action taken or envisaged by
international organizations in the implementation of the relevant resolutions of
the General Assembly. The Committee will hold further consultations and contacts
with those organizations, as appropriate. It will also be guided by the results of
further consultations to be held in 1997 between its Chairman and the President of
the Economic and Social Council in the context of the relevant decisions of the
Assembly, the Council and the Special Committee itself. Further, the Committee
will maintain close contact with the Secretaries-General and senior officials of
regional organizations such as the Organization of African Unity, the Organization
of American States, the Caribbean Community and the South Pacific Forum,
particularly those in the Caribbean and Pacific regions where the majority of the
remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories are located. The objective of those
contacts is to facilitate the effective implementation of the decisions of the
various United Nations bodies and to foster cooperation between the specialized
agencies and the regional organizations in their assistance to the
Non-Self-Governing Territories in those regions.

96. The Special Committee intends to continue to review measures to bring to an
end the activities of those foreign economic and other interests which impede the
implementation of the Declaration in Non-Self-Governing Territories, and also to
continue its study of military activities and arrangements in those Territories.

97. In its resolutions relating to Non-Self-Governing Territories, the General
Assembly has repeatedly called upon the administering Powers to cooperate or
continue to cooperate with the Special Committee by inviting United Nations
visiting missions to the Territories under their administration. Having regard to
the constructive role played by such missions in the past, the Committee continues
to attach the utmost importance to the dispatch of visiting missions as a means of
collecting adequate and first-hand information on conditions in the Territories
and on the wishes and aspirations of the people concerning their future status.
Accordingly, the Committee will continue to seek the full cooperation of the
administering Powers on the matter.

98. Taking into consideration its mandate over Western Sahara and its primary
responsibility to ensure the implementation of General Assembly resolution
1514 (XV) for all Non-Self-Governing Territories, and in accordance with a

-20-



decision it had taken at its 1397th meeting, on 23 August 1991, the Special
Committee may dispatch a mission to Western Sahara during the holding of the
referendum in the Territory.

99. Taking into account the views expressed by the representatives of the
remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories at the regional seminars organized by the
Special Committee since 1990, as well as the recommendations contained in the Plan
of Action for the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, the
Committee will continue to consider, in cooperation with the administering Powers,
how to intensify and improve the participation of the representatives of those
Territories in the work of the Committee within the existing resources.

100. In the light of the provisions of the General Assembly resolutions concerning
the pattern of conferences, and taking into consideration its experience in
previous years, as well as its probable workload for 1997, the Special Committee
has approved a tentative programme of meetings for 1997, which it commends to the
Assembly for approval.

101. The Special Committee suggests that, when the General Assembly, at its
fifty-first session, examines the question of the implementation of the
Declaration, it may wish to take into account the various recommendations of the
Committee that are reflected in the relevant chapters of the present report and, in
particular, to endorse the proposals outlined in the present section in order to
enable the Committee to carry out the tasks it envisages for 1997. In addition,
the Committee recommends that the Assembly renew its appeal to the administering
Powers to take all necessary steps for the implementation of the Declaration and
the relevant United Nations resolutions, in accordance with the freely expressed
wishes of the peoples of the Territories concerned. In this connection, the
Committee recommends that the Assembly again request the administering Powers to
cooperate or continue to cooperate with the Committee in the discharge of its
mandate and, in particular, to participate actively in the work relating to the
Territories under their respective administrations. Bearing in mind the
affirmation by the Assembly that direct association of the Non-Self-Governing
Territories in the work of the United Nations and the specialized agencies is an
effective means of promoting the progress of the peoples of those Territories
towards a position of equality with States Members of the United Nations, the
Committee also recommends that the Assembly continue to invite the administering
Powers to allow representatives of the Territories concerned to participate in the
discussions in the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth
Committee) and the Special Committee of the items relating to their respective
Territories. Further, the Assembly might also wish to renew its appeal to all
States, the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations
system to comply with the various requests addressed to them by the Assembly and
the Security Council in their relevant resolutions.

102. The Special Committee recommends that, in approving the programme of work
outlined above, the General Assembly should make adequate provision to cover the
activities the Committee envisages for 1997. In this regard, the Committee
recalls that the programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997 includes resources to
provide for the programme of work of the Committee for 1996 and 1997 based on the
level of activities approved for the year 1995, without prejudice to the decisions
to be taken by the General Assembly at its fifty-first session. On that basis, the
Committee understands that should any additional provisions be required over and
above those included in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997,
proposals for supplementary requirements would be made to the General Assembly for
its approval. Finally, the Committee expresses the hope that the
Secretary-General will continue to provide it with all the facilities and

-21-



personnel necessary for the discharge of its mandate, taking into account the
various tasks assigned to it by the Assembly as well as those arising from
decisions taken by it during the current year.

K. Conclusion of the 1996 session

103. At its 1456th meeting, on 22 July, the Special Committee decided to request
the Rapporteur to prepare the present report and to submit it directly to the
General Assembly, in accordance with established practice.

104. At the 1465th meeting, on 1 August, the Acting Chairman made a statement on
the occasion of the closing of the 1996 session of the Special Committee (see

CHAPTER II

INTERNATIONAL DECADE FOR THE ERADICATION OF COLONIALISM

105. On 19 December 1991, at its forty-sixth session, the General Assembly adopted
resolution 46/181, entitled "International Decade for the Eradication of
Colonialism", and the Plan of Action contained in the annex to the report of the
Secretary-General dated 13 December 1991 (A/46/634/Rev.1 and Corr.1). In the Plan
of Action, "aimed at ushering in, in the twenty-first century, a world free from
colonialism", the Assembly, inter alia, requested the Special Committee:

"[to] organize during the Decade seminars in the Caribbean and Pacific
regions alternately, as well as at United Nations Headquarters, to review the
progress achieved in the implementation of the plan of action, with the
participation of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, their
elected representatives, the administering Powers, Member States, regional
organizations, specialized agencies, non-governmental organizations and
experts."

106. At its 1454th and 1461st meetings, on 16 February and 24 July 1996,
respectively, the Special Committee considered the question of the "International
Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism" and the Pacific Regional Seminar to
Review the Situation in the Non-Self-Governing Territories, Particularly their
Political Evolution towards Self-Determination by the Year 2000.

107. At its 1454th meeting, the Special Committee, mindful of the mandate
entrusted to it by the General Assembly in the implementation of the Declaration on
the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, and by approving
the recommendation of its Chairman on the organization of the Committee’s work for
the year (A/AC.109/L.1841), decided to allocate to the Working Group and plenary
meetings of the Committee, as appropriate, the question of the "International
Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism".

108. On 30 April, the guidelines and rules of procedure for the Pacific Regional
Seminar (A/AC.109/2042) were issued.

109. A detailed account of the organization and proceedings of the Pacific
Regional Seminar, which was held at Port Moresby from 12 to 14 June 1996, as well
as a summary of the discussions held, is contained in the report of the Seminar
prepared by its Rapporteur (A/AC.109/2058). The report includes the topics
discussed at the Seminar, as well as the list of participants.

110. At the 1461st meeting, the Acting Chairman made a statement relating to the
report of the Seminar (see A/AC.109/SR.1461).

111. At the same meeting, the Special Committee decided to take note of the report
of the Seminar (A/AC.109/2058).

112. At its 1464th meeting, on 26 July, the Special Committee considered the
question of the International Decade on the basis of the recommendations contained
in the 103rd report of the Working Group (A/AC.109/L.1852), the relevant
paragraphs of which read as follows:

"12. Noting that the Plan of Action for the International Decade for the
Eradication of Colonialism provided for the holding of seminars alternately
in the Caribbean and the Pacific regions, the Working Group decided to

-27-



recommend to the Special Committee that it organize in 1997 a seminar in the
Caribbean region, to be attended by representatives of all Non-Self-Governing
Territories.

"13. The Working Group further decided to recommend that the Special
Committee invite United Nations organs, agencies and institutions to apprise
the Secretary-General of actions they have taken in implementation of General
Assembly resolution 46/181 of 19 December 1991 relating to the Plan of Action
and submit a report to the Assembly at its fifty-second session."

113. At the same meeting, the Special Committee approved the recommendations.

-28-



CHAPTER III

DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION ON DECOLONIZATION

A. Consideration by the Special Committee

114. At its 1454th meeting, on 16 February 1996, by adopting the suggestions
relating to the organization of its work put forward by the Chairman
(A/AC.109/L.1841), the Special Committee decided to maintain its Subcommittee on
Small Territories, Petitions, Information and Assistance and allocated to it
specific items for its consideration. The Committee further decided to consider
the question of the dissemination of information on decolonization in plenary
meetings and meetings of the Subcommittee, as appropriate.

115. The Special Committee considered the question at its 1456th meeting, on
22 July 1996.

116. In its consideration of the question, the Special Committee took into account
the provisions of the relevant General Assembly resolutions, including, in
particular, resolution 50/40 of 6 December 1995, on the dissemination of
information on decolonization, and resolution 50/39 of the same date, on the
implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples.

117. At the 1456th meeting, the Rapporteur of the Subcommittee on Small
Territories, Petitions, Information and Assistance introduced the report of the
Subcommittee (A/AC.109/L.1843), which related, inter alia, to consultations with
the representatives of the Department of Public Information and the Department of
Political Affairs of the Secretariat and to the Week of Solidarity with the Peoples
of All Colonial Territories Fighting for Freedom, Independence and Human Rights,
27-31 May 1996 (see A/AC.109/SR.1456).

118. At the same meeting, the Special Committee adopted without a vote the draft
resolution contained in the report of the Subcommittee (A/AC.109/L.1843, para. 23)
and approved the report as a whole.

119. On 1 August, the text of the resolution (A/AC.109/2063) was transmitted to
all States.

B. Decision of the Special Committee

120. The text of the resolution (A/AC.109/2063) adopted by the Special Committee
at its 1456th meeting, on 22 July 1996, appears in section C below in the form of a
recommendation of the Special Committee to the General Assembly.

Week of Solidarity with the Peoples of All Colonial Territories
Fighting for Freedom, Independence and Human Rights

121. The report of the Subcommittee on Small Territories, Petitions, Information
and Assistance (A/AC.109/L.1843), approved by the Special Committee at its 1456th
meeting, contained the following statement made by the Chairman of the
Subcommittee on the occasion of the Week of Solidarity:

-29-



Statement made by the Chairman of the Subcommittee on
Petitions, Information and Assistance on 14 June 1996

on the Week of Solidarity

"Since 1972, in accordance with General Assembly resolution
2911 (XXVII), the Governments and peoples of the world have been observing
annually a Week of Solidarity with the Peoples of All Colonial Territories.
This celebration is in full accord with the purposes and tenets embodied in
the Charter of the United Nations and is in conformity with the principles
enshrined in the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples, contained in Assembly resolution 1514 (XV).

"Today, when our Organization takes a closer look at its achievements,
its success in the field of decolonization is universally recognized.
Hundreds of millions gained their freedom and independence in the surge of
decolonization following the creation of the United Nations. Their
membership in the United Nations as sovereign States strengthened the
fundamental basis of the international community.

"We remember the history of the struggles against colonialism and pay
tribute to all those who took part in them. We remain mindful of the
sacrifices that made it possible for hundreds of millions of people to
achieve self-determination and independence.

"However important the success in the field of decolonization, the task
is still unfinished in that area and requires further concerted and
determined action on the part of all those involved. There are still peoples
who have not been able to exercise their right to self-determination. These
are mostly peoples of small island Non-Self-Governing Territories located
mainly in the Pacific and Caribbean regions. They are confronted, inter
alia, by problems of their small size, low population, geographic remoteness,
limited natural resources and vulnerability to natural disasters. Their
situations require new and innovative solutions geared towards the
implementation of the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism
launched by the General Assembly in 1988.

"Convinced as we are that in the decolonization process there is no
alternative to the principle of self-determination, we once again reiterate
the legitimacy of all options of self-determination consistent with General
Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV) as long as it is ascertained that
they are the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned. We should
continue to exercise flexibility and realism in our endeavours to complete
the process of decolonization. The wishes of the peoples of the Non-Self-
Governing Territories should not be ignored when examining once again the
options of self-determination available to them.

"In that connection, we further appeal for the strengthened and
continued support of the administering Powers, whose cooperation with the
Special Committee is essential for the progress of the Territories towards
self-determination. We count on the support of the specialized agencies,
which should continue to assist the Non-Self-Governing Territories in
enhancing their standard of living and promoting their self-sufficiency. We
count on regional and international organizations, which should explore new
avenues to provide the Non-Self-Governing Territories with legal and
political opportunities for participating in programmes that relate to their
environment and livelihood. We count on support for our efforts from all
Member States and non-governmental organizations.

-30-



"We hope and believe that our combined, unrelenting efforts will ensure
the fulfilment of the promise for freedom, lasting peace, sustained growth
and sustainable development for all the peoples of our planet in accordance
with the purposes and principles of the United Nations."

C. Recommendation of the Special Committee

122. In accordance with decisions taken at its 1454th and 1456th meetings, the
Special Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the following
draft resolution:

Dissemination of information on decolonization

other resolutions and decisions of the United Nations concerning the dissemination
of information on decolonization, in particular General Assembly resolution 50/40

Recognizing the need for flexible, practical and innovative approaches
towards reviewing the options of self-determination for the peoples of Non-Self-
Governing Territories with a view to achieving complete decolonization by the year
2000,

Reiterating the importance of dissemination of information as an instrument
for furthering the aims of the Declaration, and mindful of the role of world public
opinion in effectively assisting the peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories to
achieve self-determination,

information on decolonization,

1. Approves the chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the
Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples relating to the dissemination of

5. Requests the Special Committee to follow the implementation of the
present resolution and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its
fifty-second session.

CHAPTER IV

QUESTION OF SENDING VISITING MISSIONS TO TERRITORIES

A. Consideration by the Special Committee

123. At its 1454th meeting, on 16 February 1996, by adopting the suggestions
relating to the organization of its work put forward by the Chairman
(A/AC.109/L.1841), the Special Committee decided to take up the question of
sending visiting missions to Territories, as appropriate. The Committee further
decided that the item should be considered in its plenary meetings and, as
appropriate, by its Subcommittee on Small Territories, Petitions, Information and
Assistance, in connection with its examination of specific Territories.

124. The Special Committee considered the question at its 1461st meeting, on
24 July 1996.

125. In its consideration of the question, the Special Committee took into account
the provisions of the relevant General Assembly resolutions, including, in
particular, the pertinent provisions of resolution 50/39 of 6 December 1995, on
the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples, and resolution 50/38 of the same date, relating to specific
Territories. The Committee also considered Assembly resolution 45/33 of 20
November 1990, relating to the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration.

126. For its consideration of the question, the Special Committee had before it
the report of the Acting Chairman (A/AC.109/L.1848) on his consultations with
representatives of the administering Powers, undertaken in accordance with
paragraph 4 of the resolution adopted by the Committee at its 1442nd meeting, on
10 July 1995. 1/ At the 1461st meeting, the Acting Chairman introduced his report,
in which he stated, inter alia, that he had appealed to the administering Powers to
cooperate or continue to cooperate with the United Nations in the sending of such
missions. It had been the understanding of the Special Committee, from the
exchange of views that took place at its regional seminars held in 1990, 1992,
1993, 1995 and 1996, 2/ that some territorial Governments had expressed their
willingness to receive United Nations visiting missions.

127. The Acting Chairman reported that he had informed his interlocutors that the
Special Committee continued to attach the utmost importance to the cooperation of
the administering Powers. Their full cooperation was essential for the successful
implementation of the Plan of Action approved by the General Assembly for the
International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. He had taken the
opportunity to express his appreciation to the administering Powers concerned for
their cooperation in facilitating the participation of a number of representatives
from Non-Self-Governing Territories in the four seminars that the Committee had
organized in the context of the Decade.

128. The Acting Chairman also noted with satisfaction that, at the invitation of
the Government of New Zealand and the Council of Faipule of Tokelau, the Special
Committee had dispatched a United Nations visiting mission to Tokelau in
July 1994.

129. As in previous years, the administering Powers consulted had reiterated their
willingness to continue to provide all necessary information on the Territories
under their administration in fulfilment of their obligation under Article 73 e of
the Charter of the United Nations.

-33-



130. The representative of one administering Power had stated that his
Government’s record on decolonization had been good and that its position with
regard to the dispatch of visiting missions to the Territories under its
administration had not changed. Those territorial Governments willing to receive
visiting missions, however, should first consult with the administering Power
concerned. With regard to the concept of decolonization, the representative had
said that the Territories under his Government’s administration had democratically
elected Governments and it was up to them to decide their future status. So far,
none of those Territories had taken any action with regard to their future status.

131. The representatives of two administering Powers had stated that they remained
open to any suggestions by local Governments in the Territories concerned
regarding their readiness to receive United Nations visiting missions. The
representatives had made reference to their respective communications 3/ informing
the United Nations that they would stop participating in the work of the Special
Committee and had indicated that they did not foresee a change of policy in that
regard. However, they had reiterated the commitment of their Governments to
fulfil their obligation concerning transmission of information under Article 73 e
of the Charter.

132. The representative of New Zealand had reiterated the readiness of his
Government to continue, in accordance with established practice and procedure, to
provide the Committee with all relevant information on Tokelau and to participate
in the related work of the Special Committee. The representative had expressed the
hope that in view of the current constitutional developments in Tokelau it would be
possible for the people of the Territory to decide soon on their future status,
according to their own time-frame.

133. At the 1461st meeting, the Acting Chairman drew attention to a draft
resolution on the question (A/AC.109/L.1849).

134. At the same meeting, the representative of Cuba, supported by Papua New
Guinea, proposed the following amendments to draft resolution A/AC.109/L.1849:

(a) The insertion of a new preambular paragraph before the last preambular
paragraph, reading:

"Recalling the dispatch in 1979 of a United Nations visiting mission to
the Territory of Guam, noting the recommendation of the 1996 Pacific Regional
Seminar to send a visiting mission to Guam, and taking note of resolution 464
(LS) adopted on 19 July 1996 by the twenty-third Guam legislature which
requested the dispatch of a United Nations visiting mission to that
Territory";

(b) The addition of a new operative paragraph 5, reading:

"5. Also requests its Chairman to enter into consultations with the
administering Power of Guam with a view to facilitating the dispatch of a
United Nations visiting mission to that Territory."

135. The Committee adopted the amendments without objection.

136. The Special Committee then adopted draft resolution A/AC.109/L.1849, as
orally amended (see para. 140).

137. On 1 August, the text of the resolution (A/AC.109/2067) was transmitted to
the representatives of the administering Powers concerned for the attention of

-34-



their respective Governments.

138. In addition to the consideration of this question by the Special Committee in
plenary meetings, the Subcommittee on Small Territories, Petitions, Information
and Assistance considered the specific Territories referred to it, taking into
account the relevant provisions of the General Assembly resolutions mentioned in
paragraph 125, as well as previous decisions of the Committee relating to the
question.

139. By approving the report of the Subcommittee (A/AC.109/L.1843), the Special
Committee endorsed a number of conclusions and recommendations concerning the
sending of visiting missions to Territories, as reflected in chapter X of the
present report, relating to American Samoa, Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin
Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guam, Montserrat, St. Helena, the Turks and Caicos
Islands and the United States Virgin Islands.

B. Decision of the Special Committee

140. The text of the resolution (A/AC.109/2067) adopted by the Special Committee
at its 1461st meeting, on 24 July 1996, is reproduced below:

Recalling the relevant resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly and
the Special Committee requesting the administering Powers to cooperate fully with
the United Nations by receiving visiting missions in the Territories under their
administration,

Mindful that United Nations visiting missions provide a means of assessing
the situation in those Territories and of ascertaining the wishes and aspirations
of the peoples thereof regarding their future status,

Conscious that United Nations visiting missions enhance the capacity of the
United Nations to assist the peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories in
attaining the objectives set forth in the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in General Assembly
resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, and in other relevant resolutions of the
Assembly,

Noting with appreciation that, at the invitation of the Government of New
Zealand, a visiting mission was dispatched to Tokelau in July 1994, 5/

Recalling the dispatch in 1979 of a United Nations visiting mission to the
Territory of Guam, noting the recommendation of the 1996 Pacific Regional Seminar
to send a visiting mission to Guam, 6/ and taking note of resolution 464 (LS)
adopted on 19 July 1996 by the twenty-third Guam legislature which requested the
dispatch of a United Nations visiting mission to that Territory,

Noting with regret that some administering Powers do not participate in the
work of the Special Committee,

1. Stresses the need to dispatch periodic visiting missions to Non-Self-

-35-



Governing Territories in order to facilitate the full, speedy and effective
implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples with respect to those Territories;

2. Calls upon the administering Powers to cooperate or continue to
cooperate with the United Nations by receiving United Nations visiting missions in
the Territories under their administration;

work of the Special Committee and calls on them to cooperate with the Committee in
its efforts;

Powers concerned on the implementation of paragraph 2 of the present resolution
and to report thereon to the Special Committee as appropriate;

5. Also requests its Chairman to enter into consultations with the
administering Power of Guam with a view to facilitating the dispatch of a United

CHAPTER V

ACTIVITIES OF FOREIGN ECONOMIC AND OTHER INTERESTS WHICH IMPEDE
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DECLARATION ON THE GRANTING OF
INDEPENDENCE TO COLONIAL COUNTRIES AND PEOPLES IN TERRITORIES

UNDER COLONIAL DOMINATION

A. Consideration by the Special Committee

141. At its 1454th meeting, on 16 February 1996, by adopting the suggestions
relating to the organization of its work put forward by the Chairman
(A/AC.109/L.1841), the Special Committee decided to take up as a separate item the
question of activities of foreign economic and other interests which impede the
implementation of the Declaration in Territories under colonial domination and to
consider it in plenary meetings.

142. The Special Committee considered the item at its 1456th and 1458th meetings,
on 22 and 23 July 1996.

143. In its consideration of the item, the Special Committee took into account the
provisions of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, including, in
particular, resolution 50/33 of 6 December 1995, relating to foreign economic
activities in colonial Territories. The Committee also took into account the
relevant provisions of Assembly resolution 45/33 of 20 November 1990, on the
thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to
Colonial Countries and Peoples; and resolution 50/39 of 6 December 1995, on
implementation of the Declaration. Additionally, the Committee took into
consideration the relevant documents of other intergovernmental bodies concerned,
to which reference is made in the eleventh preambular paragraph of the resolution
it adopted on 23 July (see para. 152).

144. In 1994, in keeping with its consistent goal of limiting documentation and
streamlining its report to the General Assembly, the Special Committee had
recommended to the Assembly that, in preparing the general working papers on the
Territories, the Secretariat should, where applicable, incorporate under separate
headings those sections relating to foreign economic and other interests and those
on military activities and arrangements in those Territories. By adopting
resolution 49/89, the Assembly approved, inter alia, that recommendation.

145. For its consideration of the item, the Special Committee had before it
working papers prepared by the Secretariat containing, inter alia, information on
economic conditions, with particular reference to foreign economic activities, in
the following Territories: Anguilla, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Montserrat, Turks
and Caicos Islands and United States Virgin Islands (A/AC.109/2041 and Corr.1,
2045, 2051-2053 and 2054 and Add.1).

146. At the 1456th meeting, the Acting Chairman drew attention to a draft
resolution on the item (A/AC.109/L.1847).

147. At the same meeting, statements were made by the representatives of the
Islamic Republic of Iran, Cuba and Trinidad and Tobago and by the Secretary of the
Special Committee (see A/AC.109/SR.1456).

148. At the 1458th meeting, the representative of Trinidad and Tobago proposed an
amendment to operative paragraph 12 of the draft resolution, by which the word
"full" before the word "implementation" would be deleted.

-37-



149. At the same meeting, the Special Committee adopted draft resolution
A/AC.109/L.1847, as orally amended, without a vote (see para. 152).

150. On 1 August, the text of the resolution (A/AC.109/2064) was transmitted to
all States, the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations
system and to the Organization of African Unity, the South Pacific Forum and the
Caribbean Community.

B. Decision of the Special Committee

151. The text of the resolution (A/AC.109/2064) adopted by the Special Committee
at its 1458th meeting, on 23 July 1996, appears in section C below in the form of a
recommendation of the Special Committee to the General Assembly.

C. Recommendation of the Special Committee

152. In accordance with decisions taken at its 1454th and 1458th meetings, the
Special Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the following
draft resolution:

Activities of foreign economic and other interests which
impede the implementation of the Declaration on the
Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples

in Territories under colonial domination

The General Assembly,

Having considered the item entitled "Activities of foreign economic and other
interests which impede the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in Territories under colonial
domination",

Having examined the chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the
Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples relating to the item, 1/

Recalling its resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, as well as all its
other relevant resolutions, including, in particular, resolution 46/181 of
19 December 1991, endorsing the Plan of Action for the International Decade for the
Eradication of Colonialism, 2/

Reaffirming the solemn obligation of the administering Powers under the
Charter of the United Nations to promote the political, economic, social and
educational advancement of the inhabitants of the Territories under their
administration and to protect the human and natural resources of those Territories
against abuses,

Reaffirming also that any economic or other activity that constitutes an
obstacle to the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence
to Colonial Countries and Peoples and obstructs efforts aimed at the elimination
of colonialism is a direct violation of the rights of the inhabitants and of the
principles of the Charter and all relevant resolutions of the United Nations,

Reaffirming further that the natural resources are the heritage of the

-38-



indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories,

Aware of the special circumstances of the geographical location, size and
economic conditions of each Territory, and bearing in mind the need to promote
economic stability, diversification and strengthening of the economy of each
Territory,

Conscious of the particular vulnerability of the small Territories to natural
disasters and environmental degradation,

Conscious also that foreign economic investment, when done in collaboration
with the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories and in accordance with
their wishes, could make a valid contribution to the socio-economic development of
the Territories and could also make a valid contribution to the exercise of their
right to self-determination,

Concerned about the activities of those foreign economic, financial and other
interests which exploit the natural and human resources of the Non-Self-Governing
Territories to the detriment of the interests of the inhabitants of those
Territories and deprive them of their right to control the wealth of their
countries,

Bearing in mind the relevant provisions of the final documents of the
successive Conferences of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries
and of the resolutions adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of
the Organization of African Unity, the South Pacific Forum and the Caribbean
Community,

1. Reaffirms the inalienable right of the peoples of colonial and Non-Self-
Governing Territories to self-determination and independence and to the enjoyment
of the natural resources of their Territories, as well as their right to dispose of
those resources in their best interest;

2. Affirms the value of foreign economic investment undertaken in
collaboration with the people of the Non-Self-Governing Territories and in
accordance with their wishes in order to make a valid contribution to the
socio-economic development of the Territories;

3. Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial
peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate
rights over their natural resources, or subordinates the rights and interests of
those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests, violates the solemn
obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations;

4. Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic,
financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that
are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-
Governing Territories in the Caribbean, the Pacific and other regions, as well as
their human resources, to the detriment of their interests, thus depriving them of
their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the
realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for
self-determination and independence;

5. Reiterates its deep concern about those activities of foreign economic
and other interests in the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories which are
impeding the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to
Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in its resolution 1514 (XV), and the

-39-



efforts to eliminate colonialism;

6. Calls once again upon all Governments that have not yet done so to take,
in accordance with the relevant provisions of its resolution 2621 (XXV) of 12
October 1970, legislative, administrative or other measures in respect of their
nationals and the bodies corporate under their jurisdiction that own and operate
enterprises in colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories that are detrimental to
the interests of the inhabitants of those Territories, in order to put an end to
such enterprises and to prevent new investments that run counter to the interests
of the inhabitants of those Territories;

7. Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine
and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by
foreign economic interests, in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United
Nations, is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories;

8. Invites all Governments and organizations of the United Nations system
to take all possible measures to ensure that the permanent sovereignty of the
peoples of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories over their natural
resources is fully respected and safeguarded;

9. Urges the administering Powers concerned to take effective measures to
safeguard and guarantee the inalienable right of the peoples of the colonial and
Non-Self-Governing Territories to their natural resources and to establish and
maintain control over the future development of those resources, and requests the
administering Powers to take all necessary steps to protect the property rights of
the peoples of those Territories;

10. Calls upon the administering Powers concerned to ensure that no
discriminatory working conditions prevail in the Territories under their
administration and to promote in each Territory a fair system of wages applicable
to all the inhabitants without any discrimination;

11. Requests the Secretary-General to continue, through all means at his
disposal, to inform world public opinion of those activities of foreign economic
and other interests which impede the implementation of the Declaration;

12. Appeals to the mass media, trade unions and non-governmental
organizations, as well as individuals, to continue their efforts for the
implementation of the Declaration;

13. Decides to follow the situation in the colonial and Non-Self-Governing
Territories so as to ensure that all economic activities in those Territories are
aimed at strengthening and diversifying their economies in the interest of the
indigenous peoples and at promoting the economic and financial viability of those
Territories, in order to facilitate and accelerate the exercise by the peoples of
those Territories of their right to self-determination and independence;

14. Requests the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the
Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples to continue to examine this question and report thereon to
the General Assembly at its fifty-second session.

CHAPTER VI

MILITARY ACTIVITIES AND ARRANGEMENTS BY COLONIAL POWERS IN
TERRITORIES UNDER THEIR ADMINISTRATION

A. Consideration by the Special Committee

153. At its 1454th meeting, on 16 February 1996, by adopting the suggestions
relating to the organization of its work put forward by the Chairman
(A/AC.109/L.1841), the Special Committee decided to take up as a separate item the
question of military activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories
under their administration and to consider it in plenary meetings.

154. The Special Committee considered the item at its 1456th and 1458th meetings,
on 22 and 23 July 1996.

155. In its consideration of the item, the Special Committee took into account the
provisions of the relevant General Assembly resolutions, including, in particular,
resolution 50/39 of 6 December 1995, in paragraph 9 of which the Assembly called
upon the administering Powers to eliminate the remaining military bases in the
Non-Self-Governing Territories in compliance with the relevant resolutions of the
Assembly, and urged them not to involve those Territories in any offensive acts or
interference against other States. The Committee also took into account Assembly
decision 50/412 of 6 December 1995, in paragraph 8 of which the Assembly requested
the Committee to continue to examine the question and to report thereon to the
Assembly at its fifty-first session. Further, the Committee took into account the
relevant provisions of Assembly resolution 45/33 of 20 November 1990, relating to
the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to
Colonial Countries and Peoples.

156. In 1994, in keeping with its consistent goal of limiting documentation and
streamlining its report to the General Assembly, the Special Committee had
recommended to the Assembly that, in preparing the general working papers on the
Territories, the Secretariat should, where applicable, incorporate under separate
headings those sections relating to foreign economic and other interests and those
on military activities and arrangements in those Territories. By adopting
resolution 49/89, the Assembly approved, inter alia, that recommendation.

157. For its consideration of the item, the Special Committee had before it a
working paper prepared by the Secretariat containing, inter alia, information on
military activities and arrangements in the following Territories: Bermuda, Guam
and the United States Virgin Islands (A/AC.109/2041 and Corr.1, 2047 and Add.1 and
2054 and Add.1).

158. At the 1456th meeting, the Acting Chairman drew attention to a draft decision
on the item (A/AC.109/L.1846).

159. At the same meeting, statements were made by the representatives of the
Islamic Republic of Iran, Cuba and Trinidad and Tobago and by the Secretary of the
Special Committee (see A/AC.109/SR.1456).

160. At its 1458th meeting, the Special Committee adopted draft decision
A/AC.109/L.1846 without a vote.

161. On 1 August, the text of the decision (A/AC.109/2065) was transmitted to all
States, the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations

-42-



system and to the Organization of African Unity, the South Pacific Forum and the
Caribbean Community.

B. Decision of the Special Committee

162. The text of the decision (A/AC.109/2065) adopted by the Special Committee at
its 1458th meeting, on 23 July 1996, appears in section C below in the form of a
recommendation of the Special Committee to the General Assembly.

C. Recommendation of the Special Committee

163. In accordance with decisions taken at its 1454th and 1458th meetings, the
Special Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the following
draft decision:

Military activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in
Territories under their administration

1. The General Assembly, having considered the chapter of the report of the
Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples
relating to an item on the agenda of the Special Committee entitled "Military
activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their
administration", 1/ and recalling its resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 and
all other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations relating to
military activities in colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories, reaffirms its
strong conviction that military bases and installations in the Territories
concerned could constitute an obstacle to the exercise by the people of those
Territories of their right to self-determination, and reiterates its strong views
that existing bases and installations, which are impeding the implementation of
the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples,
should be withdrawn.

2. Aware of the presence of such bases and installations in some of those
Territories, the General Assembly urges the administering Powers concerned to
continue to take all necessary measures not to involve those Territories in any
offensive acts or interference against other States.

3. The General Assembly reiterates its concern that military activities and
arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their administration might
run counter to the rights and interests of the colonial peoples concerned,
especially their right to self-determination and independence. The Assembly once
again calls upon the administering Powers concerned to terminate such activities
and to eliminate such military bases in compliance with its relevant resolutions.

4. The General Assembly reiterates that the colonial and Non-Self-Governing
Territories and areas adjacent thereto should not be used for nuclear testing,
dumping of nuclear wastes or deployment of nuclear and other weapons of mass
destruction.

5. The General Assembly deplores the continued alienation of land in
colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories, particularly in the small island
Territories of the Pacific and Caribbean regions, for military installations. The
large-scale utilization of the local resources for this purpose could adversely

-43-



affect the economic development of the Territories concerned.

6. The General Assembly takes note of the decision of some of the
administering Powers to close or downsize some of those military bases in the
Non-Self-Governing Territories.

7. The General Assembly requests the Secretary-General to continue to
inform world public opinion of those military activities and arrangements in
colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories which constitute an obstacle to the
implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples.

8. The General Assembly requests the Special Committee on the Situation
with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples to continue to examine this
question and to report thereon to the Assembly at its fifty-second session.

164. At its 1454th meeting, on 16 February 1996, by adopting the suggestions
relating to the organization of its work put forward by the Chairman
(A/AC.109/L.1841), the Special Committee decided to take up as a separate item the

intergovernmental bodies concerned, to which reference is made in the fifth
preambular paragraph of the resolution it adopted on 1 August (see paras. 178 and
179).

168. During its consideration of the item, the Special Committee had before it a
report of the Secretary-General, 2/ submitted in response to the request addressed
to him by the General Assembly in paragraph 16 of resolution 50/34, containing
information on action taken by organizations of the United Nations system in
implementation of the resolutions of the United Nations referred to above.

169. At the 1465th meeting, the Acting Chairman reported orally on his
participation, on behalf of the Special Committee, in the work of the Economic and
Social Council in connection with its consideration of the item during the
Council’s substantive session for 1996 (see A/AC.109/SR.1465).

terms of paragraph 14 of General Assembly resolution 50/34 (A/AC.109/L.1853 and

172. The representative of the Russian Federation made a statement in explanation
of the position of his Government on the draft resolution.

173. The representative of Côte d’Ivoire requested clarification with regard to
the French text of the draft resolution.

174. At the same meeting, the representative of Cuba proposed an oral amendment to
draft resolution A/AC.109/L.1854, by which, at the end of the fifth preambular
paragraph, the words "contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)" would be
added.

175. The representative of the Russian Federation made a statement on a point of
clarification in response to a question posed to him by the representative of Cuba.

176. The Special Committee then adopted draft resolution A/AC.109/L.1854, as
orally amended, without a vote.

177. On 12 August, the text of the resolution (A/AC.109/2070) was transmitted to

Assembly the adoption of the following draft resolution:

Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting
of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples
by the specialized agencies and the international

institutions associated with the United Nations

The General Assembly,

Having considered the item entitled "Implementation of the Declaration on the
Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized
agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations",

Having also considered the reports submitted on the item by the Secretary-

-46-



General 2/ and the Chairman of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard
to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to
Colonial Countries and Peoples, 3/

Having examined the chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the
Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples relating to the item, 4/

Recalling its resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 and 1541 (XV) of
15 December 1960, and resolutions of the Special Committee, as well as other
relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations,

Bearing in mind the relevant provisions of the final documents of the
successive Conferences of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries

Community,

Conscious of the need to facilitate the implementation of the Declaration on
the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples contained in its

Territories are small island Territories,

Welcoming the assistance extended to Non-Self-Governing Territories by
certain specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system,
in particular the United Nations Development Programme,

Stressing that, because the development options of small island Non-Self-
Governing Territories are limited, there are special challenges to planning for
and implementing sustainable development and that those Territories will be
constrained in meeting the challenges without the continued cooperation and
assistance of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United
Nations system,

Stressing also the importance of securing necessary resources for funding
expanded assistance programmes for the peoples concerned and the need to enlist
the support of all major funding institutions within the United Nations system in
that regard,

Reaffirming the mandates of the specialized agencies and other organizations
of the United Nations system to take all the appropriate measures, within their
respective spheres of competence, to ensure the full implementation of resolution
1514 (XV) and other relevant resolutions,

Pacific Forum and the Caribbean Community, as well as other regional
organizations, for the continued cooperation and assistance they have extended to
the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system in
this regard,

Expressing its conviction that closer contacts and consultations between and
among the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations
system and regional organizations help to facilitate the effective formulation of
assistance programmes to the peoples concerned,

-47-



Mindful of the imperative need to keep under continuous review the activities
of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system
in the implementation of the various United Nations decisions relating to
decolonization,

Bearing in mind the extremely fragile economies of the Non-Self-Governing
small island Territories and their vulnerability to natural disasters, such as
hurricanes, cyclones and sea-level rise, and recalling its relevant resolutions,

the Declaration by the specialized agencies and the international institutions
associated with the United Nations,

peoples;

6. Requests the specialized agencies and the international institutions
associated with the United Nations, as well as regional organizations, to examine
and review conditions in each Territory so as to take appropriate measures to
accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of the Territories and
strengthen existing measures of support, and to formulate appropriate programmes
of assistance to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories, within the
framework of their respective mandates, in order to accelerate progress in the
economic and social sectors of those Territories;

7. Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and
other organizations of the United Nations system formulate, with the active
cooperation of the regional organizations concerned, concrete proposals for the
full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit
the proposals to their governing and legislative organs;

-48-

Territories and to recommend to the Assembly the most suitable steps to be taken to
enable the populations of those Territories to exercise their right to
self-determination. The Committee also took into account relevant resolutions and

The General Assembly,

Having considered the question of Tokelau,

Having examined the chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the
Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples relating to the question of
Tokelau, 1/

Recalling the solemn declaration on the future status of Tokelau delivered by
the Ulu-o-Tokelau on 30 July 1994, that an act of self-determination in Tokelau is
now under active consideration, together with the constitution of a self-governing
Tokelau, and that the present preference of Tokelau is for a status of free
association with New Zealand,

Recalling also the emphasis placed in the solemn declaration on the terms of
Tokelau’s intended free association relationship with New Zealand, including the
expectation that the form of help Tokelau could continue to expect from New Zealand
in promoting the well-being of its people, besides its external interests, would
be clearly established in the framework of that relationship,

Noting with appreciation the continuing exemplary cooperation of New Zealand
as the administering Power with the Special Committee relating to Tokelau and its

Tokelau,

Noting that, as a small island Territory, Tokelau exemplifies the situation
of most remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories,

Tokelau has wider significance for the United Nations as it seeks to complete its
work in decolonization,

1. Notes that Tokelau remains firmly committed to the development of
self-government and to an act of self-determination that would result in Tokelau
assuming a status in accordance with the options on future status for
Non-Self-Governing Territories contained in principle VI of the annex to General
Assembly resolution 1541 (XV) of 15 December 1960;

2. Also notes Tokelau’s desire to move at its own pace towards an act of
self-determination;

3. Commends Tokelau for seeking on the basis of wide consultation with its
people a form of national government that reflects its unique traditions and
environment, and for charting its own constitutional course;

4. Acknowledges the collaboration between New Zealand and Tokelau regarding
the Tokelau Amendment Act 1996, which provides Tokelau’s national government with
a legislative power, supplementing the executive power delegated in 1994;

5. Also acknowledges Tokelau’s need for reassurance, given that local
resources cannot adequately cover the material side of self-determination, and the
ongoing responsibility of Tokelau’s external partners to assist Tokelau in
balancing its desire to be self-reliant to the greatest extent possible with its
need for external assistance;

6. Welcomes the assurances of the Government of New Zealand that it will
meet its obligations to the United Nations with respect to Tokelau and abide by the
freely expressed wishes of the people of Tokelau with regard to their future
status;

7. Invites the administering Power and United Nations agencies to continue
their assistance to the social and economic development of Tokelau.
