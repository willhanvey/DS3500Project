  India, Kyrgyzstan, Russian Federation, Tajikistan and United 
States of America: draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming its previous resolutions, in particular resolution 1267 (1999) of 15 
October 1999 and the statements of its President on the situation in Afghanistan, 

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial 
integrity and national unity of Afghanistan, and its respect for Afghanistan’s cultural 
and historical heritage, 

 Recognizing the critical humanitarian needs of the Afghan people, 

 Supporting the efforts of the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General 
for Afghanistan to advance a peace process through political negotiations between 
the Afghan parties aimed at the establishment of a broad-based, multi-ethnic, and 
fully representative government, and calling for the warring factions to cooperate 
fully with those efforts to conclude a ceasefire and begin discussions leading to a 
political settlement, by moving forward promptly in the process of dialogue to 
which they have committed themselves, 

 Noting the December 2000 meeting of the Afghan Support Group which 
emphasized that the situation in Afghanistan is a complex one that requires a 
comprehensive, integrated approach to a peace process and issues of narcotics 
trafficking, terrorism, human rights, and international humanitarian and 
development aid, 

 Recalling the relevant international counter-terrorism conventions and in 
particular the obligations of parties to those conventions to extradite or prosecute 
terrorists, 

 Strongly condemning the continuing use of the areas of Afghanistan under the 
control of the Afghan faction known as Taliban, which also calls itself the Islamic 
Emirate of Afghanistan (hereinafter known as the Taliban), for the sheltering and 
training of terrorists and planning of terrorist acts, and reaffirming its conviction 
that the suppression of international terrorism is essential for the maintenance of 
international peace and security, 

 Noting the importance of the Taliban acting in accordance with the 1961 
Single Convention, the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1988 
Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 
and the commitments of the 1998 Twentieth Special Session of the General 



 

2 

S/2000/1202  

Assembly on Narcotic Drugs, including to work closely with the United Nations 
Drug Control Programme, 

 Noting that the Taliban benefits directly from the cultivation of illicit opium by 
imposing a tax on its production and indirectly benefits from the processing and 
trafficking of such opium, and recognizing that these substantial resources 
strengthen the Taliban’s capacity to harbour terrorists, 

 Deploring the fact that the Taliban continues to provide safehaven to Usama 
bin Laden and to allow him and others associated with him to operate a network of 
terrorist training camps from Taliban-controlled territory and to use Afghanistan as a 
base from which to sponsor international terrorist operations, 

 Noting the indictment of Usama bin Laden and his associates by the United 
States of America for, inter alia, the 7 August 1998 bombings of the United States 
embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and for conspiring to kill 
American nationals outside the United States, and noting also the request of the 
United States of America to the Taliban to surrender them for trial (S/1999/1021), 

 Reiterating its deep concern over the continuing violations of international 
humanitarian law and of human rights, particularly discrimination against women 
and girls, and over the significant rise in the illicit production of opium, 

 Stressing that the capture by the Taliban of the Consulate-General of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran and the murder of Iranian diplomats and a journalist in 
Mazar-e-Sharif constituted flagrant violations of established international law, 

 Determining that the failure of the Taliban authorities to respond to the 
demands in paragraph 13 of resolution 1214 (1998) and in paragraph 2 of resolution 
1267 (1999) constitutes a threat to international peace and security, 

 Stressing its determination to ensure respect for its resolutions, 

 Reaffirming the necessity for sanctions to contain adequate and effective 
exemptions to avoid adverse humanitarian consequences on the people of 
Afghanistan, and that they be structured in a way that will not impede, thwart or 
delay the work of international humanitarian assistance organizations or 
governmental relief agencies providing humanitarian assistance to the civilian 
population in the country, 

 Underlining the responsibility of the Taliban for the well-being of the 
population in the areas of Afghanistan under its control, and in this context calling 
on the Taliban to ensure the safe and unhindered access of relief personnel and aid 
to all those in need in the territory under their control, 

 Recalling the relevant principles contained in the Convention on the Safety of 
United Nations and Associated Personnel adopted by the General Assembly in its 
resolution 49/59 of 9 December 1994, 

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 

 1. Demands that the Taliban comply with resolution 1267 (1999) and, in 
particular, cease the provision of sanctuary and training for international terrorists 
and their organizations, take appropriate effective measures to ensure that the

preparation or organization of terrorist acts against other States or their citizens, and 
cooperate with international efforts to bring indicted terrorists to justice; 

 2. Demands also that the Taliban comply without further delay with the 
demand of the Security Council in paragraph 2 of resolution 1267 (1999) that

country where he has been indicted, or to appropriate authorities in a country where 
he will be returned to such a country, or to appropriate authorities in a country 
where he will be arrested and effectively brought to justice; 

 3. Demands further that the Taliban should act swiftly to close all camps 
where terrorists are trained within the territory under its control, and calls for the
