11Taking note of the reports of the Committee for Programme and 
Co-ordination and of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary

concerning the orientation to be given to the programmes of the 
Organization in the light of paragraph (e) of the Council's dec is ion;". 

12. The repr~sentative of the United States of America considered that the word 
11study" in operative paragraph 5 of the draft resolution (A/C.5/33/L.l9/Rev.l) 
might be misleading, since it could be interpreted to mean that further review 
was needed when, in fact, a test of feasibility of time-limited objectives was 
to be carried out. He orally proposed the substitution of the word "testing'' for 
the word nstudy 11 in operative paragraph 5.

14. The representative of Tunisia, speaking on behalf of the co-sponsors of the 
draft resolution (A/C.5/33/L.l9/Rev.l), as amended, stated that the draft was 
not a narrow partisan proposal by the Group of 77, but incorporated the results 
of extensive consultations. He had no difficulty with the amenillnent proposed by 
the Soviet Union in paragraph 3 of A/C.5/33/L.26, but, apart from this, he 
opposed any other amendments.

15. At the 52nd meeting, on 6 recember, the representative of Tunisia, speaking 
on behalf of the co-sponsors, stated that he could accept the proposed amendments 
in paragraphs 2 and 3 of A/C.5/33/L.~6 and that he agreed with the understanding 
of the representative of the United States that the use of the word 11study 11 in 
operative paragraph 5 of the draft resolution (A/C.5/33/L.l9/Rev.l, as amended) did 
not imply any further review of the need to test out the feasibility of time-
limited objectives. The representative of the United States then stated that he 
would not insist on his proposed amendment. 

16. The representative of Australia proposed the replacement of the phrase ;;in 
the light n by ;'taking account as appropriate rr in operative paragraph l of the 
draft resolution (A/C.5/33/L.l9/Rev.l, as amended). 

17. After a number of interventions against them, the representative of 
Australia withdrew his proposed amendments.

representative of the USSR withdrew the amendments to the draft resolution 
proposed in paragraphs l, 4, 5, and 6 of A/C.5/33/L.26, as orally corrected. 

19. The Chairman suggested tbat the draft resolution be adopted by consensus.
