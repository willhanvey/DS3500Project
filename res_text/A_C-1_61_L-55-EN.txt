 The General Assembly, 

 Guided by the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United 
Nations and reaffirming its respect for and commitment to international law,  

 Recalling its resolutions 46/36 L of 9 December 1991, 51/45 N of 10  December 
1996, 51/47 B of 10 December 1996, 56/24 V of 24 December 2001, 60/69 of 
8 December 2005 and 60/82 of 8 December 2005,  

 Recognizing that arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation are essential 
for the maintenance of international peace and security,  

 Reaffirming the inherent right of all States to individual or collective self-
defence in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter, 

 Acknowledging the right of all States to manufacture, import, export, transfer 
and retain conventional arms for self-defence and security needs, and in order to 
participate in peace support operations, 



A/C.1/61/L.55  
 

06-56784 2 
 

 Recalling the obligations of all States to fully comply with arms embargoes 
decided by the Security Council in accordance with the Charter, 

 Reaffirming our respect for international law, including international human 
rights law and international humanitarian law, and the Charter,  

 Taking note of and encouraging relevant initiatives, undertaken at the 
international, regional and subregional levels between States, including those of the 
United Nations, and of the role played by non-governmental organizations and civil 
society, to enhance cooperation, improve information exchange and transparency 
and implement confidence-building measures in the field of responsible arms trade,  

 Recognizing that the absence of common international standards on the import, 
export and transfer of conventional arms is a contributory factor to conflict, the 
displacement of people, crime and terrorism, thereby undermining peace, 
reconciliation, safety, security, stability and sustainable development, 

 Acknowledging the growing support across all regions for concluding a legally 
binding instrument negotiated on a non-discriminatory, transparent and multilateral 
basis, to establish common international standards for the import, export and 
transfer of conventional arms, 

 1. Requests the Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States on 
the feasibility, scope and draft parameters for a comprehensive, legally binding 
instrument establishing common international standards for the import, export and 
transfer of conventional arms, and to submit a report on the subject to the General 
Assembly at its sixty-second session; 

 2. Also requests the Secretary-General to establish a group of governmental 
experts, on the basis of equitable geographic distribution, commencing in 2008, 
informed by the report of the Secretary-General submitted to the General Assembly 
at its sixty-second session, to examine the feasibility, scope and draft parameters for 
a comprehensive, legally binding instrument establishing common international 
standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms, and to transmit 
the report of the group of experts to the General Assembly for consideration at its 
sixty-third session; 

 3. Further requests the Secretary-General to provide the group of 
governmental experts with any assistance and services that may be required for the 
discharge of its tasks; 

 4. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-second session 
the item entitled “Towards an arms trade treaty: establishing common international 
standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms”.
