  Russian Federation and United States of America: draft resolution  
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Noting with concern that the situation in the Middle East is tense and is likely 

to remain so, unless and until a comprehensive settlement covering all aspects of the 

Middle East problem can be reached,  

 Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the United Nations 

Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) of 22 March 2021 (S/2021/282) and 2 June 

2021 (S/2021/516), and also reaffirming its resolution 1308 (2000) of 17 July 2000, 

 Stressing that both parties must abide by the terms of the 1974 Disengagement 

of Forces Agreement between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic and scrupulously 

observe the ceasefire, 

 Expressing concern that the ongoing military activities conducted by any actor 

in the area of separation continue to have the potential to escalate tensions between 

Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic, jeopardize the ceasefire between the two 

countries, and pose a risk to the local civilian population and United Nations 

personnel on the ground, 

 Expressing its appreciation in this regard to UNDOF’s liaison efforts to prevent 

any escalation of the situation across the ceasefire line,  

 Expressing alarm that violence in the Syrian Arab Republic risks a serious 

conflagration of the conflict in the region,  

 Expressing concern at all violations of the Disengagement of Forces Agreement,  

 Noting the Secretary-General’s latest report on the situation in the area of 

operations of UNDOF, including findings about weapons fire across the ceasefire line 

as well as ongoing military activity on the Bravo side of the area of separation, and 

in this regard underscoring that there should be no military forces, military 

equipment, or personnel in the area of separation other than those of UNDOF,  

 Calling upon all parties to the Syrian domestic conflict to cease military actions 

throughout the country, including in the UNDOF area of operations, and to respect 

international humanitarian law, 

 Noting the significant threat to the UN personnel in the UNDOF area of 

operation from unexploded ordnance, explosive remnants of war and mines, and 

emphasizing in this regard the need for demining and clearance operations in strict 

compliance with the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement,

to UNDOF’s area of operations as soon as practicable,  

 Emphasizing the importance of Security Council and troop-contributing 

countries having access to reports and information related to UNDOF’s redeployment 

configuration, and reinforcing that such information assists the Security Council with 

evaluating, mandating, and reviewing UNDOF and with effective consul tation with 

troop-contributing countries, 

 Underscoring the need for UNDOF to have at its disposal all necessary means 

and resources to carry out its mandate safely and securely, including technology and 

equipment to enhance its observation of the area of separation and the ceasefire line, 

and to improve force protection, as appropriate, and recalling that the theft of United 

Nations weapons and ammunition, vehicles and other assets, and the looting and 

destruction of United Nations facilities, are unacceptable, 

 Expressing its profound appreciation to UNDOF’s military and civilian 

personnel, including those from Observer Group Golan, for their service in an 

ongoing, challenging operating environment, underscoring the important

positions on the Bravo side, 

 Taking note of the Secretary-General’s plan for UNDOF to return to the Bravo 

side based on a continuous assessment of security in the area of separation and its 

surroundings, and continued discussion and coordination with the parties,  

 Recalls that UNDOF’s deployment and the 1974 Disengagement of Forces 

Agreement are steps toward a just and durable peace on the basis of Security Council 

Resolution 338 (1973), 

 Recalling resolution 2378 (2017) and its request of the Secretary-General to ensure 

that data related to the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations, including peacekeeping 

performance data, is used to improve analytics and the evaluation of mission operations, 

based on clear and well identified benchmarks, and further recalling resolution 2436 

(2018) and its request of the Secretary-General to ensure that decisions to recognize and 

incentivize outstanding performance and decisions regarding deployment, remediation,
