  France, Germany and United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland: draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling the Statement of its President, S/PRST/2006/15, of 29 March 2006, 
and its resolution 1696 (2006) of 31 July 2006, its resolution 1737 (2006) of 
23 December 2006 and its resolution 1747 (2007) of 24 March 2007, and 
reaffirming their provisions, 

 Reaffirming its commitment to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons, the need for all States Party to that Treaty to comply fully with all their 
obligations, and recalling the right of States Party, in conformity with Articles I and 
II of that Treaty, to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for 
peaceful purposes without discrimination, 

 Recalling the resolution of the IAEA Board of Governors (GOV/2006/14), 
which states that a solution to the Iranian nuclear issue would contribute to global 
non-proliferation efforts and to realizing the objective of a Middle East free of 
weapons of mass destruction, including their means of delivery, 

 Noting with serious concern that, as confirmed by the reports of 23 May 2007 
(GOV/2007/22), 30 August 2007 (GOV/2007/48), 15 November 2007 
(GOV/2007/58) and 22 February 2008 (GOV/2008/4) of the Director General of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran has not established full and 
sustained suspension of all enrichment related and reprocessing activities and heavy 
water-related projects as set out in resolution 1696 (2006), 1737 (2006), and 1747 
(2007), nor resumed its cooperation with the IAEA under the Additional Protocol, 
nor taken the other steps required by the IAEA Board of Governors, nor complied 
with the provisions of Security Council resolution 1696 (2006), 1737 (2006) and 
1747 (2007) and which are essential to build confidence, and deploring Iran’s 
refusal to take these steps, 

 Noting with concern that Iran has taken issue with the IAEA’s right to verify 
design information which had been provided by Iran pursuant to the modified Code 
3.1, emphasizing that in accordance with Article 39 of Iran’s Safeguards Agreement 
Code 3.1 cannot be modified nor suspended unilaterally and that the Agency’s right 
to verify design information provided to it is a continuing right, which is not 
dependent on the stage of construction of, or the presence of nuclear material at, a 
facility, 



S/2008/141  
 

08-25787 2 
 

 Reiterating its determination to reinforce the authority of the IAEA, strongly 
supporting the role of the IAEA Board of Governors, commending the IAEA for its 
efforts to resolve outstanding issues relating to Iran’s nuclear programme in the 
work plan between the Secretariat of the IAEA and Iran (GOV/2007/48, 
Attachment), welcoming the progress in implementation of this work plan as 
reflected in the IAEA Director General’s reports of 15 November 2007 
(GOV/2007/58) and 22 February 2008 (GOV/2008/4), underlining the importance 
of Iran producing tangible results rapidly and effectively by completing 
implementation of this work plan including by providing answers to all the 
questions the IAEA asks so that the Agency, through the implementation of the 
required transparency measures, can assess the completeness and correctness of 
Iran’s declaration, 

 Expressing the conviction that the suspension set out in paragraph 2 of 
resolution 1737 (2006) as well as full, verified Iranian compliance with the 
requirements set out by the IAEA Board of Governors would contribute to a 
diplomatic, negotiated solution, that guarantees Iran’s nuclear programme is for 
exclusively peaceful purposes, 

 Stressing that China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the United 
Kingdom and the United States are willing to take further concrete measures on 
exploring an overall strategy of resolving the Iranian nuclear issue through 
negotiation on the basis of their June 2006 proposals (S/2006/521), and noting the 
confirmation by these countries that once the confidence of the international 
community in the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme is 
restored, it will be treated in the same manner as that of any Non-Nuclear Weapon 
State party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, 

 Having regard to States’ rights and obligations relating to international trade, 

 Welcoming the guidance issued by the Financial Actions Task Force (FATF) to 
assist States in implementing their financial obligations under resolution 1737 
(2006), 

 Determined to give effect to its decisions by adopting appropriate measures to 
persuade Iran to comply with resolution 1696 (2006), resolution 1737 (2006), 
resolution 1747 (2007) and with the requirements of the IAEA, and also to constrain 
Iran’s development of sensitive technologies in support of its nuclear and missile 
programmes, until such time as the Security Council determines that the objectives 
of these resolutions have been met, 

 Concerned by the proliferation risks presented by the Iranian nuclear 
programme and, in this context, by Iran’s continuing failure to meet the 
requirements of the IAEA Board of Governors and to comply with the provisions of 
Security Council resolutions 1696 (2006), 1737 (2006) and 1747 (2007), mindful of 
its primary responsibility under the Charter of the United Nations for the 
maintenance of international peace and security, 

 Acting under Article 41 of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 

 1. Reaffirms that Iran shall without further delay take the steps required by 
the IAEA Board of Governors in its resolution GOV/2006/14, which are essential to 
build confidence in the exclusively peaceful purpose of its nuclear programme and 
to resolve outstanding questions, and, in this context, affirms its decision that Iran 



 S/2008/141
 

3 08-25787 
 

shall without delay take the steps required in paragraph 2 of resolution 1737 (2006), 
and underlines that the IAEA has sought confirmation that Iran will apply Code 3.1 
modified; 

 2. Welcomes the agreement between Iran and the IAEA to resolve all 
outstanding issues concerning Iran’s nuclear programme and progress made in this 
regard as set out in the Director General’s report of 22 February 2008 
(GOV/2008/4), encourages the IAEA to continue its work to clarify all outstanding 
issues, stresses that this would help to re-establish international confidence in the 
exclusively peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme, and supports the IAEA in 
strengthening its safeguards on Iran’s nuclear activities in accordance with the 
Safeguards Agreement between Iran and the IAEA; 

 3. Calls upon all States to exercise vigilance and restraint regarding the 
entry into or transit through their territories of individuals who are engaged in, 
directly associated with or providing support for Iran’s proliferation sensitive 
nuclear activities or for the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems, and 
decides in this regard that all States shall notify the Committee established pursuant 
to paragraph 18 of resolution 1737 (2006) (herein “the Committee”) of the entry 
into or transit through their territories of the persons designated in the Annex to 
resolution 1737 (2006), Annex I to resolution 1747 (2007) or Annex I to this 
resolution, as well as of additional persons designated by the Security Council or the

such entry or transit is for activities directly related to the items in subparagraphs 
3(b) (i) and (ii) of resolution 1737 (2006); 

 4. Underlines that nothing in paragraph 3 above requires a State to refuse 
its own nationals entry into its territory, and that all States shall, in the 
implementation of the above paragraph, take into account humanitarian 
considerations, including religious obligations, as well as the necessity to meet the 
objectives of this resolution, resolution 1737 (2006) and resolution 1747 (2007), 
including where Article XV of the IAEA Statute is engaged; 

 5. Decides that all States shall take the necessary measures to prevent the

3 (b) (i) and (ii) of resolution 1737 (2006) and provided that nothing in this 
paragraph shall oblige a State to refuse its own nationals entry into its territory; 

 6. Decides that the measures imposed by paragraph 5 above shall not apply 
where the Committee determines on a case-by-case basis that such travel is justified 
on the grounds of humanitarian need, including religious obligations, or where the 



S/2008/141  
 

08-25787 4 
 

Committee concludes that an exemption would otherwise further the objectives of 
the present resolution; 

 7. Decides that the measures specified in paragraphs 12, 13, 14 and 15 of

 9. Calls upon all States to exercise vigilance in entering into new 
commitments for public provided financial support for trade with Iran, including the 
granting of export credits, guarantees or insurance, to their nationals or entities 
involved in such trade, in order to avoid such financial support contributing to the
