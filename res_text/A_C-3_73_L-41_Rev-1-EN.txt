human rights in the context of peaceful protests and the rights to freedom of peaceful 

assembly and association, 

 Noting that 2018 marks the seventieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration 

of Human Rights, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and 

Programme of Action3 and the twentieth anniversary of the Declaration on the Right 

and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and 

Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and 

acknowledging the importance of these instruments for the promotion and the 

protection of all human rights,  

 Bearing in mind that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent 

and interrelated, 

 Reaffirming that everyone has the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and 

of association and that no one may be compelled to belong to an association,  

 Recognizing that the effective exercise of the rights to freedom of peaceful 

assembly and of association is essential for the enjoyment of other human rights and 

freedoms and constitutes a fundamental pillar for building a democratic society and 

strengthening democracy, as it provides individuals with invaluable opportunities to, 

inter alia, express their political opinions, engage in literary and artistic pursuits and 

other cultural, economic and social activities, engage in religious observances or other 

beliefs, form and join trade unions and cooperatives and elect leaders to represent 

their interests and hold them accountable,  

 Recalling the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, of expression and of 

association, which encompass organizing, participating, observing, monitoring and 

recording assemblies, and expressing concern at the criminalization, in all parts of the 

world, of individuals and groups solely for having organized, taken part in or 

observed, monitored or recorded peaceful protests,  

 Recognizing that transparent, responsible, accountable, open and participatory 

government, responsive to the needs and aspirations of the people, is the foundation 

on which good governance rests, and that such a foundation is one of the 

indispensable conditions for the full realization of human rights, including the rights 

to peaceful assembly and freedoms of association and expression,  

 Stressing, therefore, that everyone, including persons espousing minority or 

dissenting views or beliefs, must be able to express their grievances or aspirations in 

a peaceful manner, including through public protests, without fear of reprisal or of 

being intimidated, harassed, injured, sexually assaulted, beaten, arbitrarily arrested 

and detained, tortured, killed or subjected to enforced disappearance, 

 Encouraging all States to avoid using force wherever possible during peaceful 

protests and to ensure that, where force is absolutely necessary, no one is subjected 

to excessive or indiscriminate use of force,  

 Gravely concerned by the grave and growing threats, risks and dangers faced 

by all individuals, online and offline, for exercising their rights to peaceful assembly 

and freedoms of expression and association, particularly members of civil society, 

including but not limited to human rights defenders, including women human rights 

defenders, indigenous human rights defenders and those addressing environmental 

issues, and those defending persons belonging to minorities, including religious 

minorities, as well as those defending youth, persons with disabilities and older 

persons, labour leaders, individuals who may face multiple and intersecting forms of 

discrimination, including on the basis of gender, and journalists and media workers

who report on their work, as well as by the prevalence of impunity for violations and 

abuses against them in many countries, where they face threats, harassment and 

attacks and suffer insecurity, including through undue restrictions on, inter alia, the 

rights to freedom of opinion, expression, association and peaceful assembly, and 

through the abuse of criminal or civil proceedings, or acts of intimidation and reprisal 

intended to prevent their cooperation with the United Nations and other international 

bodies in the field of human rights,  

 Stressing the responsibility of Member States and encouraging stakeholders in 

all sectors of society and in their respective communities, including Governments and 

their representatives, with respect to all individuals exercising their rights to peaceful 

assembly and freedoms of expression and association, online and offline, in cases of 

threat, harassment, violence, discrimination, racism and other violations and abuses 

committed against them, including killings, to categorically and clearly reject such 

practices and offences,  

 Reiterating that domestic law and administrative provisions and their application 

should not hinder but enable the work of human rights defenders, including by 

avoiding any criminalization, stigmatization, impediments, obstructions or restrictions 

thereof contrary to the obligations of States under international human rights law,  

 Deploring violations and abuses of the rights to peaceful assembly and freedom 

of association by State and non-State actors, including arbitrary detentions of peaceful 

protestors and individuals on the basis of their political opinion and affiliation, as 

well as individuals identified as political opponents,  

 1. Calls upon States to promote a safe and enabling environment for 

individuals and groups to exercise their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, of 

expression and of association, including by ensuring that domestic legislation and 

procedures relating to the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, of expression and 

of association are in conformity with their international human rights obligations;  

 2. Urges States to take concrete steps to prevent and put an end to the 

arbitrary arrest and detention of peaceful protestors and human rights defenders for 

exercising their human rights and fundamental freedoms of expression, peaceful 

assembly and association, including in relation to cooperation with the United Nations 

and other international mechanisms in the area of human rights, and in this regard 

strongly urges the release of such persons detained or imprisoned in violation of the 

obligations of States under international human rights law;  

 3. Expresses deep concern about extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 

executions and the torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 

punishment of persons exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, of 

expression and of association in all regions of the world, and to this end:  

 (a) Strongly condemns the use of harassment, intimidation and extrajudicial, 

summary or arbitrary executions and killings by State and non-State actors to 

violently suppress and silence individuals, including young people and students, for 

participating in peaceful protests, including protests to call for democratic reforms;  

 (b) Urges States to pay particular attention to the safety and protection of 

women and women human rights defenders from acts of intimidation and harassment, 

as well as gender-based violence, including sexual assault, in the context of peaceful 

protests; 

 (c) Calls upon all States to pay particular attention to the safety of journalists 

and media workers observing, monitoring and recording peaceful protests, taking into 

account their specific role, exposure and vulnerability;  



A/C.3/73/L.41/Rev.1 
 

 

18-19416 4/4 

 

 (d) Urges States to end their harassment and intimidation of and attacks 

against individuals participating in peaceful protests against racism and racial 

discrimination;  

 4. Calls upon all States to ensure that the same rights that individuals have 

offline, including the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and 

association, are also fully protected online, in accordance with human rights law, 

particularly by refraining from Internet shutdowns and content restrictions on the 

Internet that violate international human rights law, by ending attacks by States and 

taking steps to end attacks by non-State actors against journalists and other media 

workers covering demonstrations and protests and by ending government shutdowns 

of media outlets for attempting to report on such protests, and condemns 

unequivocally and calls for an end to all attacks and violence by State and non-State 

actors against journalists and media workers, including through attacks on, or the 

forced closure of, their offices and media outlets, in both conflict and non -conflict 

situations, in particular for journalists and media outlets covering or attempting to 

cover demonstrations and protests; 

 5. Condemns the use by State and non-State actors of slander, threats and 

attacks against members of civil society, including against religious leaders, including  

when they are attempting to use their good offices to mediate between the State and 

individuals trying to exercise their right to peacefully assemble;  

 6. Encourages States to support the implementation of policies and 

initiatives that promote tolerance, cultural integration and inclusion and respect for 

diversity, to end the persecution and repression of civil society and social movements 

and to recognize the important and legitimate role that they play in shaping 

governance and the rule of law, inclusiveness and development across all regions;  

 7. Underlines the necessity of addressing the management of assemblies, 

including peaceful protests, so as to contribute to their peaceful conduct and prevent 

injuries and loss of life among protestors, those observing, monitoring and recording 

such assemblies, bystanders and officials exercising law enforcement duties, and 

urges States to ensure accountability for human rights violations and abuses through 

judicial or other national mechanisms, based on law and in conformity with their 

international human rights obligations and commitments, and to provide all victims 

with access to remedy and redress, including in the context of peaceful protests;  

 8. Urges States to acknowledge, through public statements, policies,  

programmes and laws, the important and legitimate role of individuals, groups and 

organs of society in the promotion of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, 

including the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.
