-Cb) The imbalanoe of present world eoonomio conditions makes it
extremely diffioult to bring about sustained improvement in the world's
environmental situation. Accelerated and balanced world devolopment and
lasting improvements in the global environment require improved world economio
conditions, especially for the developing countries,

degradation, its elimination and ensuring equitable access of people to
environmental resouroes are essential for sustained environmontal improvements,

eoonomio growth and social well-being. Environmental degradation, 1n ita
various forms, has assumed such proportions as can cause irreversible changes

constraints, however, are generally relativo to the state of technology and
socio-economic conditions which can and should be i~proved and managod to
achieve sustained world economic growth,

anticipatory and preventive policies are the most effeotive and economical in
achioving environmentally sound development,

other sectors, 80 internali~ation of environm~ntal conditions in soctoral

sustainable development,

en~uting that che prrties causing the damage will be acoountablo for their
actfon, and that they will partioipate, on the basis of full acceoe to

DRAFT RESOLUTION 11

Traffic in toxic and dangerous products and wastes

The General Assemblx,

Recalling decisions 14/19 on the International Register of Potentially
Toxic Chemicals, 14/27 on environmentally safe management of chemicals, in
particular those that are banned and severely restricted in international

internationally accepted guidelines and principles, to the detriment of the
environment and pUblic health of all countries, particularly of developing

Appreciati'ng that concepts, ideas and recommendations contained in the
report of the World Commiasion on Environment and Development W havo been
inoorporated into the Environmental PerspectivJ,

1. Expresses ita appreciation for the efforts of the Governing Council
of the United Nations Environment PrQ9ramme and its IntegovernmoY\tal
Inter-sessional Preparatory Committee in the preparation of the Enviornmental
Perspeotive to the Year 2000 and Beyond, ]!/

2. Adopts the Environmental Perspective to the Year 2000 and Beyond, aB
ann~xed to this resolution, as a broad framework to guide national action and
international co-operation on policies and programmes aimed at achieving
environmentally sound development, and specifioally as a guide to the
preparation of further system-wide medium-term environment programmes and the
medium-term programmes of the organizations and bodies of the United Nations
system, in the light of Governing Council decision 14/13,

3. Notes that the perceptions generally shared by Governments of the
nature of environment~l problems, and their interrelations with other
internation~l problems, ~nd of the efforts to deal with them include the
following.

(a) An international atmosphere of peace, security and co-operation,
free from the presence and the threat of wars of all types, especially nuclear
war, and from the waste of intellectual and natural resources on armaments by
any nation, would greatly enhance environmentally sound development,

(b) The imbalance of present wOlld economic conditions makes it
extremely difficult to bring about sustained improvement in the world's
environmental situation. Accelerated and balanced world development and
lasting improvements in the global environment require improved world economic
conditions, especially for the developing countries,

(c) Since mass poverty is often at the root of environmental
dAgradat1on, its elimination and ensuring equitable acceGS of people to
envitonmental resources are essential for sustained environmental improvements 1

(d) The environment proviues constraints as well as opportunities for
economic growth and social well-b~ing. ~nvironmental degradation, in its
various forms, has assumed such proportions as can cause irreversihle changes
in ecosystems, which threaten to undermine human well-being. Environmental
constraints, however, are generally relative to the state of technology and
socio-economlc conditions, which can and should be improved and managed to
~chieve sustained world economic growth,

(e) Bnvironmental isaues ~re closely intertwined with development
policies and practices. Consequently, environmental goals and aotions need to
be defined in relation to development objectives and policies,

(f) Although it is important to tackle immedi~~e environmental problems,
antioipatory and preventive policies are the most effective and economical 1n
achieving environmentally sound development,

(g) The environmental impacta of actions in one sector are often felt in
other seotors, 80 internalization of environmental conditionu in sectoral
poli~ie8 and programmes and their oo-ordination are essential to achieve
8u8tainable development,

(h) Since confliots of interest among popUlation groups, or among
countries, are often inherent in the nature of ~nvironmental pr.oblems, the
participation of the concerned parties is essential to determine effective
environmental management practices,

(1) Environmental degradation can be controlled and reversed only by
ensuring that the parties causing the damage will be acoountable for their
action, and that they will partioipate, on the basi~ of full aooess to
available knowledge, in improving environmental conditions,

(j) Renewable resources, as part of oomplex and interlinked ecoaystems,
can have sustainable yields only if used while taking into account system-wide
effects of exploitation,

(k) Sa:eguarding of species is a moral obligation of humankind and
sh~uld improve and sustain human well-being,

(1) Building awareness at various levels of environmental ~ond1tions and
management, through the provision of infor~ation, education and training, ls
essential for environmental proteotion and improvement,

(m) Strategies to deal with environmental challenges have to be flexible
and should allow for adjustments to emerging problems and evolving
environmental management technology,

(n) The growing number and variety of international environmental
disputes need to be resolved by peaceful means,

4. Welcomes as the overall aspirationsl goal for the world community
the achievement of sustainable development on the basis of prudent management
of available global resources and environmental capacities and the
rehabilitation of the environment previously SUbjected to degradation and
misuse, and the aspirational goals to the year 2000 and beyond as set out in
the Environmental Perspective, namely.
