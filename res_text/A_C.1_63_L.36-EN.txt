  Consolidation of peace through practical disarmament measures 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 51/45 N of 10 December 1996, 52/38 G of 
9 December 1997, 53/77 M of 4 December 1998, 54/54 H of 1 December 1999, 
55/33 G of 20 November 2000, 56/24 P of 29 November 2001 and 57/81 of 
22 November 2002, its decision 58/519 of 8 December 2003 as well as its 
resolutions 59/82 of 3 December 2004 and 61/76 of 6 December 2006 entitled 
“Consolidation of peace through practical disarmament measures”, 

 Convinced that a comprehensive and integrated approach towards certain 
practical disarmament measures often is a prerequisite to maintaining and 
consolidating peace and security and thus provides a basis for effective post-conflict 
peacebuilding; such measures include collection and responsible disposal, 
preferably through destruction, of weapons obtained through illicit trafficking or 
illicit manufacture as well as of weapons and ammunition declared by competent 
national authorities to be surplus to requirements, particularly with regard to small 
arms and light weapons, unless another form of disposition or use has been 
officially authorized and provided that such weapons have been duly marked and 



A/C.1/63/L.36

registered; confidence-building measures; disarmament, demobilization and 
reintegration of former combatants; demining; and conversion, 

 Noting with satisfaction that the international community is more than ever 
aware of the importance of such practical disarmament measures, especially with 
regard to the growing problems arising from the excessive accumulation and 
uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons, including their ammunition, 
which pose a threat to peace and security and reduce the prospects for economic 
development in many regions, particularly in post-conflict situations, 

 Stressing that further efforts are needed in order to develop and effectively 
implement programmes of practical disarmament in affected areas as part of 
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration measures so as to complement, on a 
case-by-case basis, peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts, 

 Taking note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General on 
prevention of armed conflict,1 which, inter alia, refers to the role which the 
proliferation and the illicit transfer of small arms and light weapons play in the 
context of the build-up and sustaining of conflicts, 

 Taking note of the statement by the President of the Security Council of 
31 August 20012 underlining the importance of practical disarmament measures in 
the context of armed conflicts, and, with regard to disarmament, demobilization and 
reintegration programmes, emphasizing the importance of measures to contain the 
security risks stemming from the use of illicit small arms and light weapons, 

 Taking note also of the report of the Secretary-General prepared with the 
assistance of the Group of Governmental Experts on Small Arms3 and, in particular, 
the recommendations contained therein, as an important contribution to the 
consolidation of the peace process through practical disarmament measures, 

 Welcoming the work of the United Nations Coordinating Action on Small Arms 
mechanism, which was established by the Secretary-General to bring about a 
holistic and multidisciplinary approach to this complex and multifaceted global 
problem, 

 Welcoming also the establishment, within the United Nations system, of the 
Programme of Action Implementation Support System, which provides a 
comprehensive tool to facilitate international cooperation and assistance for the 
implementation of practical disarmament measures, including the matching of 
assistance needs with available resources,  

 Welcoming further the reports of the First, Second and Third Biennial 
Meetings of States to Consider the Implementation of the Programme of Action to 
Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in 
All Its Aspects, held in New York from 7 to 11 July 2003,4 from 11 to 15 July 
2005,5 and from 14 to 18 July 2008,6

peacekeeping missions, as appropriate and with the consent of the host State, 
practical disarmament measures aimed at addressing the problem of the illicit trade

and reintegration programmes aimed at former combatants, with a view to

that would contribute to a sustainable peacebuilding process; 

 4. Welcomes the activities undertaken by the Group of Interested States, and

agencies; 

 5. Encourages Member States, also in the framework of the Group of 
Interested States, to continue to lend their support to the Secretary-General, relevant 
international, regional and subregional organizations, in accordance with 
Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations, and non-governmental 
organizations in responding to requests by Member States to collect and destroy 
small arms and light weapons, including their ammunition, in post-conflict 
situations; 

 6. Welcomes the synergies within the multi-stakeholder process, including 
Governments, the United Nations system, regional and subregional organizations 
and institutions as well as non-governmental organizations in support of practical 
disarmament measures and the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and 
Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects;9 

 7. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its

measures, taking into consideration the activities of the Group of Interested States in 
this regard; 

 8. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-fifth session the 
item entitled “Consolidation of peace through practical disarmament measures”.
