 Condemning the grave deterioration of the human rights situation and the 

indiscriminate killing and deliberate targeting of civilians as such, in violation of  

international humanitarian law, and acts of violence that foment sectarian tensions,  

 Noting with concern the culture of impunity for serious violations of 

international humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human rights law 

committed during the present conflict, which has provided a fertile ground for 

further violations and abuses, 

 Recalling that, amid expressions of popular discontent over restrictions on the 

enjoyment of civil, political, economic and social rights, civilian protests erupted i n 

Dar’a in March 2011, and noting that the excessive and violent oppression of 

civilian protests by the Syrian authorities, which later escalated to the direct shelling 

of civilian population areas, fuelled the escalation of armed violence and extremist 

groups, including so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) (Daesh),  

 Expressing outrage at the continuing escalation of violence in the Syrian Arab 

Republic, which has caused more than 250,000 fatalities, including the killing of 

many more than 10,000 children, and in particular at the continued widespread and 

systematic gross violations, as well as abuses, of human rights and violations of 

international humanitarian law, including those involving the continued 

indiscriminate use of heavy weapons and aerial bombardments, such as the 

indiscriminate use of ballistic missiles, cluster munitions, barrel and vacuum bombs 

and chlorine gas, and the starvation of civilians as a method of combat, which are 

prohibited under international humanitarian law, by the Syrian authorities against 

the Syrian population,  

 Expressing grave concern at the disproportionate use of force by the Syrian 

authorities against its civilians, which caused immense human suffering and 

fomented the spread of extremism and extremist groups and which demonstrates the 

failure of the Syrian authorities to protect its population and to implement the 

relevant resolutions and decisions of United Nations bodies,  

 Taking note of the identical letters dated 18 June 2015 addressed to the 

Secretary-General, the President of the General Assembly and the President of the 

Security Council, on behalf of 71 Member States,  expressing outrage regarding the

continued bloodshed and violence against civilians in Syria, caused in particular by 

the systematic use of barrel bombs, 

 Expressing grave concern at the spread of extremism and extremist groups, 

terrorism and terrorist groups, and strongly condemning all violations and abuses of 

human rights and violations of international humanitarian law committed in the 

Syrian Arab Republic by any party to the conflict, in particular so -called ISIL 

(Daesh), militias fighting on behalf of the regime, Al -Qaida-affiliated terrorist 

groups and other extremist groups,  

 Expressing support for the work carried out by the Independent International 

Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, and strongly condemning the 

lack of cooperation by the Syrian authorities with the Commission of Inquiry,  

 Noting with serious concern the observation of the Commission of Inquiry 

that, since March 2011, the Syrian authorities have conducted widespread attacks 

against the civilian population as a matter of policy,  

 Recalling the statements made by the Secretary-General, the United Nations 

High Commissioner for Human Rights and the special procedures of the Human 

Rights Council that crimes against humanity and war crimes are likely to have been 

committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, noting the repeated encouragement by the 

High Commissioner for the Security Council to refer the si tuation to the 

International Criminal Court, and regretting that a draft resolution
18

 was not adopted 

notwithstanding broad support from Member States,  

 Expressing its deepest concern about the findings of the Commission of 

Inquiry and also the allegations contained in the evidence presented by “Caesar” in 

January 2014 regarding the torture and execution of persons incarcerated by the 

Syrian authorities, and underscoring the need for those allegations and similar 

evidence to be collected, examined and made available for future accountability 

efforts,  

 Expressing concern that the implementation of Security Council resolutions 

2139 (2014), 2165 (2014) and 2191 (2014) remains largely unfulfilled, and noting 

the urgent need to strengthen efforts to address the humanitarian situation in the 

Syrian Arab Republic, including through protection of civilians and rapid, safe and 

unhindered humanitarian access, 

 Recalling its commitment to Security Council resolutions 2170 (2014) and 

2178 (2014), 

 Alarmed that more than 4.2 million refugees, including more than 2.8 million 

women and children, have been forced to flee the Syrian Arab Republic and that 

12.2 million people in the Syrian Arab Republic, of whom 6.5 million are internally 

displaced, require urgent humanitarian assistance, which has resulted in an influx of 

Syrian refugees into neighbouring countries, other countries in the region and 

beyond, and alarmed at the risk the situation presents to regional and international 

stability,  

 Expressing its profound indignation at the death of many more than 10,000 

children and the many more injured since the beginning of the peaceful protests in 

March 2011, and at all grave violations and abuses committed against children in

made by neighbouring countries and other countries in the region to accommodate 

Syrians, while acknowledging the increasing financial, socioeconomic and political

A/C.3/70/L.47 

 

7/9 15-19064

growing humanitarian needs of Syrian refugees, while emphasizing the principle of 

burden-sharing; 

 23. Strongly condemns the intentional denial of humanitarian assistance to 

civilians, from whatever quarter, and in particular the denial of medical assistance 

and the withdrawal of water and sanitation services to civilian areas, which has 

recently worsened, stressing that the starvation of civilians as a method of combat is 

prohibited under international law, noting especially the primary responsibility of 

the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic in this regard, and deplores the 

deteriorating humanitarian situation;  

 24. Demands that the Syrian authorities and all other parties to the conflict 

do not hinder the full, immediate and safe access of the United Nations and 

humanitarian actors, including to besieged and hard -to-reach areas, consistent with

authorities to publish a list of all detention facilities;  

 27. Demands that the Syrian authorities, ISIL (Daesh), Al -Nusrah Front and 

all other groups halt the arbitrary detention of civilians and release all detained 

civilians;

 28. Calls for the appropriate international monitoring bodies to be granted 

access to detainees in government prisons and detention centres, including all 

military facilities referred to in the reports of the Commission of Inquiry;  

 29. Strongly condemns the use of chemical weapons and all indiscriminate 

methods of warfare in the Syrian Arab Republic, which is prohibited under 

international law, and notes with grave concern the Commission of Inquiry's 

findings that the Syrian authorities have repeatedly used chlorine gas as an illegal 

weapon, which constitutes a violation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the 

Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their 

Destruction
21

 and is prohibited under international law;

declare its programme in full and eliminate it in its entirety;  

 32. Also demands that all parties take all appropriate steps to protect 

civilians, including members of ethnic, religious and confessional communiti es, and 

stresses that, in this regard, the primary responsibility to protect its population lies 

with the Syrian authorities;  

 33. Strongly condemns the damage and destruction of the cultural heritage of 

the Syrian Arab Republic, as well as the organized looting and trafficking of its 

cultural property, as outlined by the Security Council in its resolution 2199 (2015)
