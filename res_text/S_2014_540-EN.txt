Iraq,  

 Emphasizing the importance of the stability and security of Iraq for the people 
of Iraq, the region, and the international community,  

 Expressing grave concern at the current security situation in Iraq as a result of 
a large-scale offensive carried out by terrorist groups, in particular the Islamic State 
in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and associated armed groups, involving a steep 
escalation of attacks, heavy human casualties including children, the displacement 
of more than one million Iraqi civilians, and the threats against all religious and 
ethnic groups, condemning the attacks perpetrated by these terrorist groups and 
associated armed groups, in particular the events in Anbar province in January 2014 
and the city of Mosul and other parts of the country in June 2014 by ISIL, against 
the people of Iraq in an attempt to destabilize the country and region, and reiterating 
its commitment to Iraq’s security and territorial integrity, 

 Noting that the advance of ISIL on Iraq’s sovereign territory is a major threat 
to Iraq’s future, underscoring that the only way to address this threat is for all Iraqis 
to work together by addressing needs in the security as well as the political realm, 
stressing the long-term solution to the instability will require the political leadership 
of Iraq to make decisions that will unite the country, and emphasizing the 
importance of the international community supporting Iraq in this regard, 

 Calling on all political entities to overcome divisions and work together in an 
inclusive and timely political process aimed at strengthening Iraq’s national unity, 
sovereignty and independence; and for Iraq’s leaders to engage, as quickly as 
possible, to form a Government that represents the will and sovereignty of all 
segments of the Iraqi population and that would contribute to finding a viable and 
sustainable solution to the country’s current challenges; and reaffirming its belief 
that through its democratic institutions, in cooperation with Iraqi society, Iraq can
