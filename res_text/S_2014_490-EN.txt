  Australia, Chad, Chile, France, Jordan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, 

Republic of Korea, Rwanda, United Kingdom of Great Britain and 

Northern Ireland and United States of America: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council,  

 Recalling its resolutions 2042 (2012), 2043 (2012), 2118 (2013) and 2139 

(2014), and its Presidential Statements of 3 August 2011, 21 March 2012, 5 April 

2012 and 2 October 2013,  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 

territorial integrity of Syria, and to the purposes and principles of the Chart er of the 

United Nations, 

 Being appalled at the unacceptable and escalating level of violence and the 

death of more than 150,000 people, including well over 10,000 children, as a result 

of the Syrian conflict as reported by the Special Representative of the Secretary-

General for Children and Armed Conflict,  

 Expressing grave alarm at the significant and rapid deterioration of the 

humanitarian situation in Syria, at the fact that the number of people in need of 

assistance has grown to over 10 million, including 6.4 million internally displaced 

persons and over 4.5 million living in hard-to-reach areas, and that over 240,000 are 

trapped in besieged areas, as reported by the United Nations Secretary-General, 

 Deploring the fact that the demands in its resolution 2139 (2014) and the 

provisions of its Presidential Statement of 2 October 2013 (S/PRST/2013/15) have 

not been heeded by the Syrian parties to the conflict as stated in the United Nations 

Secretary-General’s reports of 22 May 2014 (S/2014/365) and 20 June 2014 

(S/2014/427), and recognizing that, while some steps have been undertaken by the 

Syrian parties, they have not had the necessary impact on the delivery of 

humanitarian assistance to all people in need throughout Syria,  

 Commending the indispensable and ongoing efforts of the United Nations, its 

specialized agencies and all humanitarian and medical personnel in Syria and in 

neighbouring countries to alleviate the impact of the conflict on the Syrian people,  

 Reiterating its appreciation for the significant and admirable efforts that have 

been made by the countries of the region, notably Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and 

Egypt, to accommodate the more than 2.8 million refugees who have fled Syria as a 

result of ongoing violence including the approximately 300,000 refugees who have 

fled since the adoption of resolution 2139 (2014), and urging again all Member

States, based on burden-sharing principles, to support these neighbouring host 

countries to enable them to respond to the growing humanitarian needs, includi ng by 

providing direct support,  

 Strongly condemning the continuing widespread violations of human rights and 

international humanitarian law by the Syrian authorities, as well as the human rights 

abuses and violations of international humanitarian law by armed groups,  

 Stressing the need to end impunity for violations of international humanitarian 

law and violations and abuses of human rights, and reaffirming that those who have 

committed or are otherwise responsible for such violations and abuses in Syri a must 

be brought to justice, 

 Expressing grave alarm in particular at the continuing indiscriminate attacks 

in populated areas, including an intensified campaign of aerial bombings and the use 

of barrel bombs in Aleppo and other areas, artillery, shelling and air strikes, and the 

widespread use of torture, ill-treatment, sexual and gender-based violence as well as 

all grave violations and abuses committed against children, and reiterating that 

some of these violations may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, 

 Reiterating its demand that all parties demilitarize medical facilities, schools 

and other civilian facilities and avoid establishing military positions in populated 

areas and desist from attacks directed against civilian objects,  

 Reaffirming the primary responsibility of the Syrian authorities to protect the 

population in Syria and reiterating that parties to armed conflict bear the primary 

responsibility to take all feasible steps to ensure the protection of civilians, and 

recalling in this regard its demand that all parties to armed conflict comply fully 

with the obligations applicable to them under international law related to the 

protection of civilians in armed conflict, including journalists, media professionals 

and associated personnel, 

 Recalling the need for all parties to respect the relevant provisions of 

international humanitarian law and the United Nations guiding principles of 

humanitarian emergency assistance, 

 Expressing grave alarm at the spread of extremism and extremist groups, the 

targeting of civilians based on their ethnicity, religion and/or confessional 

affiliations, expressing further grave alarm at the increased attacks resulting in 

numerous casualties and destruction, indiscriminate shelling by mortars, car bombs,  

suicide attacks, tunnel bombs as well as hostage taking, kidnappings, and attacks 

against civilian infrastructure including deliberate interruptions of water supply, 

condemning terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and recalling in this regard 

its resolutions 1373 (2001), 1624 (2005), 2129 (2013) and 2133 (2014), 

 Deeply disturbed by the continued, arbitrary and unjustified withholding of 

consent to relief operations and the persistence of conditions that impede the 

delivery of humanitarian supplies to destinations within Syria, in particular to  

besieged and hard-to-reach areas, and noting the United Nations Secretary-General’s 

view that arbitrarily withholding consent for the opening of all relevant border 

crossings is a violation of international humanitarian law and an act of 

non-compliance with resolution 2139 (2014), 

 Emphasizing that the humanitarian situation will continue to deteriorate further 

in the absence of a political solution to the crisis, reiterating its endorsement of the

Geneva Communiqué of 30 June 2012 (Annex II of resolution 2118 (2013)) and 

demanding that all parties work towards the immediate and comprehensive 

implementation of the Geneva Communiqué aimed at bringing an immediate end to 

all violence, violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international 

law, and facilitating the Syrian-led process launched in Montreux on 22 January 

2014, leading to a transition that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian 

people and enables them independently and democratically to determine their own 

future, 

 Recalling its intent, expressed in its resolution 2139 (2014), to take further 

steps in the case of non-compliance with the resolution, 

 Determining that the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Syria constitutes a 

threat to peace and security in the region, 

 Underscoring that Member States are obligated under Article 25 of the Charter 

of the United Nations to accept and carry out the Council’s decisions,  

 1. Reiterates that all parties to the conflict, in particular the Syrian 

authorities, must comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law

2013 (S/PRST/2013/15);  

 2. Decides that the United Nations humanitarian agencies and their 

implementing partners are authorized to use routes across conflict lines and the 

border crossings of Bab al-Salam, Bab al-Hawa, Al Yarubiyah and Al-Ramtha, in 

addition to those already in use, in order to ensure that humanitarian assistance, 

including medical and surgical supplies, reaches people in need throughout Syria 

through the most direct routes, with notification to the Syrian authorities, and to this 

end stresses the need for all border crossings to be used efficiently for United 

Nations humanitarian operations;  

 3. Decides to establish a monitoring mechanism, under the authority of the 

United Nations Secretary-General, to monitor, with the consent of the relevant 

neighbouring countries of Syria, the loading of all humanitarian relief consignments 

of the United Nations humanitarian agencies and their implementing partners at the 

relevant United Nations facilities, and any subsequent opening of the consignments 

by the customs authorities of the relevant neighbouring countries, for passage into 

Syria across the border crossings of Bab al-Salam, Bab al-Hawa, Al Yarubiyah and 

Al-Ramtha, and with notification by the United Nations to the Syrian authorities, in 

order to confirm the humanitarian nature of these relief consignments;  

 4. Decides that the United Nations monitoring mechanism shall be deployed 

expeditiously;  

 5. Further decides that the decisions contained in operative paragraphs two 

and three of this resolution shall expire 180 days from the adoption of this 

resolution, and shall be subject to review by the Security Council;

devoid of any political prejudices and aims, including by immediately removing all 

impediments to the provision of humanitarian assistance;  

 7. Notes in this regard the role that ceasefire agreements that are consistent 

with humanitarian principles and international humanitarian law could play to 

facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance in order to help save civilia n lives, 

and further underscores the need for the parties to agree on humanitarian pauses, 

days of tranquillity, localized ceasefires and truces to allow humanitarian agencies 

safe and unhindered access to all affected areas in Syria in accordance with 

international humanitarian law, and recalls that starvation of civilians as a method 

of combat is prohibited by international humanitarian law;  

 8. Decides that all Syrian parties to the conflict shall take all appropriate 

steps to ensure the safety and security of United Nations and associated personnel, 

those of its specialized agencies, and all other personnel engaged in humanitarian 

relief activities as required by international humanitarian law, without prejudice to 

their freedom of movement and access, stresses the need not to impede or hinder 

these efforts, and recalls that attacks on humanitarian workers may amount to war 

crimes;  

 9. Reiterates that the only sustainable solution to the current crisis in Syria 

is through an inclusive and Syrian-led political process with a view to full 

implementation of the Geneva Communiqué of 30 June 2012 endorsed as Annex II 

of its resolution 2118 (2013), pays tribute to the efforts of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, and
