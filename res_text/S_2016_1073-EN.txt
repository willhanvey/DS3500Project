 The Security Council,  

 Recalling Presidential Statement 2015/25,  

 Taking note of the Secretary-General’s reports S/2016/949, as well as 

S/2015/203 and S/2016/361, 

 Recalling its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace 

and security, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations,  

 Recalling the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized 

Crime, and its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 

Especially Women and Children, which includes the first internationally agreed 

definition of the crime of trafficking in persons and provides a framework t o 

effectively prevent and combat trafficking in persons, and further recalling the 

United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons,  

 Recognizing that trafficking in persons in areas affected by armed conflict and 

post conflict situations can be for the purpose of various forms of exploitation, 

including exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual 

exploitation, forced labour, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the 

removal of organs; further recognizing that trafficking in persons in armed conflict 

and post conflict situations can also be associated with sexual violence in conflict 

and that children in situations of armed conflict and persons displaced by armed 

conflict, including refugees, can be especially vulnerable to trafficking in persons in 

armed conflict and to these forms of exploitation,  

 Reiterating the critical importance of all Member States fully implementing 

relevant Security Council resolutions, including resolutions 2195 (2014) and 2253

(2015), which express concern that terrorists benefit from transnational organized 

crime in some regions, including from the trafficking in persons  among others, as 

well as 2242 (2015), which expresses concern that acts of sexual and gender -based 

violence are known to be part of the strategic objectives and ideology of certain 

terrorist groups; and recognizing the connection between trafficking in persons, 

sexual violence and terrorism and other transnational organized criminal activities, 

which can prolong and exacerbate conflict and instability or intensify its impact on 

civilian populations, 

 Expressing deep concern that acts of sexual and gender-based violence, 

including when associated to trafficking in persons, are known to be part of the 

strategic objectives and ideology of certain terrorist groups, used as a tactic of 

terrorism and an instrument to increase their finances and their power through 

recruitment and the destruction of communities, as described in the relevant 

Secretary-General’s Reports; that trafficking in persons, in particular women and 

girls, remains a critical component of the financial flows to certain terrorist groups; 

and that, when leading to certain forms of exploitation, is being used by these 

groups as a driver for recruitment,  

 Recognizing that trafficking in persons entails the violation or abuse of human 

rights, and underscoring that certain acts or offences associated with trafficking in 

persons in the context of armed conflict may constitute war crimes; and recalling 

further the responsibilities of States to end impunity and to prosecute those 

responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes as well as other 

crimes and the need for States to adopt appropriate measures within their national 

legal systems for those crimes for which they are required under international law to 

exercise their responsibility to investigate and prosecute, 

 Expressing solidarity with victims of trafficking in persons, including victims 

of trafficking in persons in armed conflict and post-conflict situations and in 

humanitarian crisis derived from them; noting in this regard the importance of 

assistance and services for the physical, psychological and social recovery, 

rehabilitation and reintegration; recognizing the extreme trauma experienced by the 

victims of trafficking in persons in the context of armed conflict and sexual violen ce 

in conflict, and that humanitarian organizations should consider this vulnerability in 

humanitarian planning, 

 Reaffirming that trafficking in persons in the context of armed conflict, 

especially women and girls, cannot and should not be associated with  any religion, 

nationality, or civilization, 

 Emphasizing the importance of engaging religious and traditional leaders, 

paying particular attention to amplifying the voices of women and girls alongside 

men and boys, with the objective of countering terrorism and violent extremism 

which can be conducive to terrorism, refuting the justification of trafficking in 

persons in the context of armed conflict and sexual or other violence in conflict, 

addressing the stigmatization suffered by survivors and facilitating their return and 

reintegration in families and communities,  

 Recalling all its resolutions on children and armed conflict that call for the 

protection of children affected by armed conflicts; condemning all violations and 

abuses against children in armed conflict and noting in particular that the

S/2016/1073 

 

3/8 16-22532 

 

recruitment and use of children in violation of applicable international law by 

parties to armed conflict can be associated with trafficking in persons; expressing 

grave concern over the high numbers of girls and boys among persons trafficked in 

armed conflict and their heightened vulnerability to violations and abuses, including 

girls and boys who are forcibly displaced by armed conflict, particularly when 

separated from their families or caregivers,  

 Recalling resolution 2249 (2015), in which the Security Council condemns in 

the strongest terms the gross, systematic, and widespread abuses of human rights 

and violations of international humanitarian law by ISIL (also known as Daesh), and 

resolution 2253 (2015), in which the Security Council condemns in the strongest 

terms abductions of women and children, including by ISIL, ANF, and associated 

individuals, groups, undertakings and entities, expresses outrage at their 

exploitation and abuse, including rape and sexual violence, forced marriage, and 

enslavement by these entities, and notes that any person or entity who transfers 

funds to ISIL directly or indirectly in connection with such exploitation and abuse 

would be eligible for listing by the Security Council Committee established 

pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011) and 2253 (2015) concerning ISIL 

(Da’esh), Al-Qaida and associated individuals, groups, undertakings and entities,  

 Noting with concern the criminal misuse of information and communications 

technologies, particularly the Internet, to facilitate the trafficking of persons, in 

particular the sale and trade, by certain terrorist groups and emphasizing the 

importance of countering such use as part of counter-terrorism efforts while 

respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms and in compliance with other 

obligations under international law, 

 1. Condemns in the strongest terms all instances of trafficking in persons in 

areas affected by armed conflicts, and stresses that trafficking in persons 

undermines the rule of law and contributes to other forms of transnational organized 

crime, which can exacerbate conflict and foster insecurity and instability and 

undermine development; 

 2. Calls upon Member States: 

 (a) That have not yet done so, to consider as a matter of priority ratifying or 

acceding to and to fully implement the United Nations Convention Against 

Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 

Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children, as well as all relevant 

international instruments;  

 (b) To take decisive and immediate action to prevent, criminalize, 

investigate, prosecute and ensure accountability of those who engage in trafficking 

in persons, including in the context of armed conflict, in which it is particularly 

important that evidence of such crimes be collected and preserved so that 

investigations and prosecutions may occur;  

 (c) To investigate, disrupt and dismantle networks involved in trafficking in 

persons in the context of armed conflict, in accordance with national legislation, 

including anti-money laundering, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and, where 

appropriate, counter terrorism laws, and underscores in this regard the importance 

of international law enforcement cooperation, including with respect to 

investigation, documentation, and prosecution of trafficking cases, calls in this

regard for the continued support of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 

(UNODC) and other relevant United Nations entities, and international and regional 

bodies, including INTERPOL, as appropriate, in providing technical assistance upo n 

request and within their existing mandates, and encourages Member States to 

consider establishing jurisdiction in line with article 15 of the UN Convention 

against Transnational Organized Crime;  

 (d) To implement robust victim, and possible victim, identification 

mechanisms and provide access to protection and assistance for identified victims 

without delay, also in relation to trafficking in persons in armed conflict, including 

where such victims are refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), and to 

address comprehensively victims’ needs, including the provision of or access to 

medical, psycho-social assistance and legal aid, as well as ensure that victims are 

treated as victims of crime and in line with domestic legislation not penalized or 

stigmatized for their involvement in any unlawful activities in which they have been 

compelled to engage; calls in this regard for the continued support of UNODC and 

other relevant United Nations entities, including UNHCR, as well as international 

and regional bodies, including IOM, in assisting Member States, upon request, with 

identification of and assistance to trafficking victims;  

 3. Encourages Member States to: 

 (a) Build strong partnerships with the private sector and civil society, 

including local women organizations, and to redouble their efforts by encouraging 

these actors to provide information helping to identify, disrupt, dismantle and bring 

to justice individuals and networks involved in trafficking in persons in areas 

affected by armed conflict, including by training relevant officials such as law 

enforcement personnel, border control officers, labour inspectors, consular or 

embassy officials, judges and prosecutors and peacekeepers to identify indicators of 

trafficking in persons in areas affected by armed conflict in supply chains; 

 (b) Consider that in some circumstances trafficking in persons in armed 

conflict in all its forms and sexual violence in conflict can cause large movements 

of refugees and migrants; recalls the Convention Relating to the  Status of Refugees 

and/or its Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees; and furthermore urges that all 

refugee-receiving countries provide information on the services available to victims 

of trafficking and sexual violence survivors, ensure sustainable psychosocial 

support and provide survivors with the option to document their cases for future 

legal action to hold traffickers accountable, and that due consideration is given to 

clarifying and securing the legal status of undocumented refugee children, i ncluding 

refugee children conceived as a result of sexual violence or exploitation, to avoid 

situations of possible statelessness; 

 4. Encourages the Financial Action Task-Force (FATF) and FATF-Style 

Regional Bodies (FSRBs) to consider including an analysis of financial flows 

associated with trafficking in persons that finances terrorism as part of its ongoing 

work, in close cooperation with CTED, the Analytical Support and Sanctions 

Monitoring Team and with UNODC;  

 5. Calls on those Member States who have not yet done so to develop the 

expertise of their Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) to analyse cases of trafficking 

in persons that finance terrorism, and encourages them to work together to develop 



 
S/2016/1073 

 

5/8 16-22532 

 

that capacity, and, in this regard, further encourages Member States and relevant 

UN entities and other international and regional organizations to provide other 

States which may need so, upon their request, with the financial, material and 

technical assistance that they may require to build the capacity mentioned above; 

 6. Calls on Member States to consider reinforcing legal and regulatory 

measures to facilitate the sharing of information, both domestically and 

internationally, between law enforcement and regulatory actors and the private 

sector as well as within the private sector, in line with applicable international and 

national law, to help identify and detect suspicious financial activity related to 

trafficking in persons that finances terrorism, while also recognizing the need to 

protect the confidentiality of personal data of victims;  

 7. Recalls its decision, in resolution 1373 (2001) that all Member States 

shall ensure that any person who participates in the financing, planning, preparation 

or perpetration of terrorist acts or in supporting terrorist acts is brought to justice, 

urges all States to ensure that their domestic laws and regulations establish serious 

criminal offenses sufficient to provide the ability to prosecute and penalize in a 

manner duly reflecting the seriousness of the offence of trafficking in persons 

committed with the purpose of supporting terrorist organizations or individual 

terrorists, including through the financing of and recruitment for the commission of 

terrorist acts;  

 8. Stresses that acts of trafficking in persons in armed conflict and sexual 

and gender-based violence in conflict, including when it is associated to trafficking 

in persons in armed conflict, can be part of the strategic objectives and ideology of, 

and used as a tactic by certain terrorist groups, by, inter alia, incentivizing 

recruitment; supporting financing through the sale, trade and trafficking of women, 

girls and boys; destroying, punishing, subjugating, or controlling communities; 

displacing populations from strategically important zones; extracting information 

for intelligence purposes from male and female detainees; advancing ideology 

which includes the suppression of women’s rights and the use of religious 

justification to codify and institutionalize sexual slavery and exert control over 

women’s reproduction; and therefore encourages all relevant actors at the national, 

regional and international level to ensure that such considerations are taken into 

account, in accordance with their obligations under international law and national 

laws; 

 9. Underlines further that achieving the strategic objectives noted above 

may entail the use of various forms of sexual violence in conflict, also when 

associated with trafficking in persons in the context of armed conflict, including, 

inter alia, rape, sexual slavery, forced prostitution and forced pregnancy, and notes 

that these different forms of sexual violence in conflict may require tailored 

programmatic responses including specialized medical and psychosocial assistance 

and analysis as a basis for action;  

 10. Affirms that victims of trafficking in persons in all its forms, and of 

sexual violence, committed by terrorist groups should be classified as victims of 

terrorism with the purpose of rendering them eligible for official support, 

recognition and redress available to victims of terrorism, have access to national 

relief and reparations programmes, contribute to lifting the socio -cultural stigma 

attached to this category of crime and facilitate rehabilitation and reintegration

efforts; furthermore emphasizes that survivors should benefit from relief and 

recovery programmes, including health care, psychosocial care, safe shelter 

livelihood support and legal aid and that services should include provision for 

women with children born as a result of wartime rape, as well as men and boys who 

may have been victims of sexual violence in conflict, including when it is associated 

with trafficking in persons in armed conflict;  

 11. Condemns all acts of trafficking, particularly the sale or trade in persons 

undertaken by the ‘Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant’ (ISIL, also known as 

Da’esh), including of Yazidis and other persons belonging to religious and ethnic 

minorities, and condemns also any such trafficking in persons and violations and 

other abuses committed by Boko Haram, Al-Shabaab, the Lord’s Resistance Army, 

and other terrorist or armed groups for the purpose of sexual slavery, sexual 

exploitation, and forced labour, recognizes the importance of collecting and 

preserving evidence relating to such acts in order to ensure that those responsible 

can be held accountable, and notes that such acts may also contribute to the funding 

and sustainment of such groups or to serve other strategic objectives as outlined in 

paragraph 5 above;  

 12. Expresses its intention to consider targeted sanctions for individuals and 

entities involved in trafficking in persons in areas affected by armed conflict and in 

sexual violence in conflict, and encourages information exchange and other 

appropriate forms of cooperation between relevant United Nations entities, 

including the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict and the Special 

Representative on Children in Armed Conflict, within their respective mandates, 

regarding initiatives and strategies to curb trafficking in persons in the context of 

armed conflict;  

 13. Expresses further its intention to integrate the issue of trafficking in 

persons in the areas affected by armed conflict and sexual violence in conflict into 

the work of relevant sanctions committees where in accordance with their mandates, 

and to ensure that sexual violence in conflict expertise, including when it is 

associated with trafficking in persons in the context of armed conflict consistently 

informs the work of sanctions committees, and further expresses its intention to 

invite the Special Representatives of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in 

Conflict and on Children and Armed Conflict to brief these sanctions committees, as 

necessary, in accordance with the Committee’s rules of procedure, and to provide 

relevant information including, if applicable, the names of individuals involved in 

the trafficking in persons who may meet the committees’ designation criteria;  

 14. Requests the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, when 

consulting with Member States, to include in their discussions the issue of 

trafficking in persons in the areas of armed conflict and the use of sexual violence in 

armed conflict as it relates to ISIL (also Known as Da’esh), Al Qaida and associated 

individuals, groups, undertakings and entities and to report to the Security Council 

Committee established pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011) and 2253 

(2015) on these discussions as appropriate; 

 15. Encourages Member States to ensure that existing national strategic 

frameworks and national action plans against trafficking in persons national action

through the financing of or recruitment for the commission of terrorist acts;  

 17. Encourages UNODC and other relevant United Nations entities, 

including UNHCR and UNICEF, and other international and regional bodies, 

including INTERPOL and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), to 

continue supporting upon request, in accordance with their respective mandates and 

expertise, Member States efforts to develop such capabilities, including through the 

exchange of information and the strengthening of networks for regional and 

international cooperation in relation to trafficking in persons in areas affected by

Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict and the Team of Experts on Rule of 

Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict to strengthen monitoring and analysis of 

sexual violence in conflict, including when associated with trafficking in persons in 

armed conflict and post conflict situations, used as a tactic of war and also as a 

tactic by certain terrorist groups, as well as in seeking concrete and time -bound 

commitments and implementation plans by all parties to conflict to prevent and 

address such crimes in line with resolutions 1960 and 2106, and encourages a more 

systematic approach and the acceleration of such efforts; furthermore requests
