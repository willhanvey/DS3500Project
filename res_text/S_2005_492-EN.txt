France, Germany, Romania, Russian Federation,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and
United States of America: draft resolution

The Security Council,

Recalling all its relevant resolutions, in particular resolution 1582 of
28 January 2005 (S/RES/1582),

Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 14 July 2005,

Recalling the conclusions of the Lisbon (S/1997/57, annex) and Istanbul
summits of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
regarding the situation in Abkhazia, Georgia,

Recalling the relevant principles contained in the Convention on the Safety of
United Nations and Associated Personnel adopted on 9 December 1994,

Deploring that the perpetrators of the shooting down of a helicopter of the
United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) on 8 October 2001, which
resulted in the death of nine people on board, have still not been identified,

Stressing that the continued lack of progress on key issues of a comprehensive
settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia, is unacceptable,

Welcoming, however, the positive momentum given to the United Nations-led
peace process by regular high-level meetings of the Group of Friends in Geneva and
the Georgian-Russian summit meetings,

Welcoming the important contributions made by UNOMIG and the Collective
Peacekeeping Forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS
peacekeeping force) in stabilizing the situation in the zone of conflict, and stressing
its attachment to the close cooperation existing between them in the performance of
their respective mandates,

1. Reaffirms the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally
recognized borders, and the necessity to define the status of Abkhazia within the
State of Georgia in strict accordance with these principles;

2. Commends and strongly supports the sustained efforts of the Secretary-
General and his Special Representative, with the assistance of the Russian
Federation in its capacity as facilitator as well as of the Group of Friends of the



2

S/2005/492

Secretary-General and of the OSCE, to promote the stabilization of the situation and
the achievement of a comprehensive political settlement, which must include a
settlement of the political status of Abkhazia within the State of Georgia;

3. Reiterates its strong support for the document on “Basic Principles for
the Distribution of Competences between Tbilisi and Sukhumi” and for its letter of
transmittal, finalized by, and with the full support of, all members of the Group of
Friends;

4. Deeply regrets the continued refusal of the Abkhaz side to agree to a
discussion on the substance of this document, again strongly urges the Abkhaz side
to receive the document and its transmittal letter, urges both parties thereafter to
give them full and open consideration, and to engage in constructive negotiations on
their substance, and urges those having influence with the parties to promote this
outcome;

5. Regrets also the lack of progress on the initiation of political status
negotiations, and recalls, once again, that the purpose of these documents is to
facilitate meaningful negotiations between the parties, under the leadership of the
United Nations, on the status of Abkhazia within the State of Georgia, and is not an
attempt to impose or dictate any specific solution to the parties;

6. Calls on both sides to participate in constructive negotiations towards a
political settlement of the conflict and to spare no efforts to overcome their ongoing
mutual mistrust and underlines that the process of negotiation leading to a lasting
political settlement acceptable to both sides will require concessions from both
sides;

7. Welcomes the commitment by the Georgian side to a peaceful resolution
of the conflict and calls on both parties further to publicly dissociate themselves
from all militant rhetoric and demonstrations of support for military options;

8. Reminds all concerned to refrain from any action that might impede the
peace process;

9. Welcomes the convening of regular meetings of senior representatives of
the Group of Friends and the United Nations in Geneva as well as the participation
of both sides in the last meeting on 7 and 8 April 2005 and the commitments
expressed by the parties during this meeting and strongly urges both sides to
continue to participate constructively in future meetings;

10. Urges the parties to participate in a more active, regular and structured
manner in the task forces established in the first Geneva meeting (to address issues
in the priority areas of economic cooperation, the return of internally displaced
persons and refugees, and political and security matters) and complemented by the
working groups established in Sochi in March 2003, and reiterates that results-
oriented activities in these three priority areas remain key to building common
ground between the Georgian and Abkhaz sides and ultimately for concluding
meaningful negotiations on a comprehensive political settlement based on the paper
entitled “Basic Principles for the Distribution of Competences between Tbilisi and
Sukhumi” and its transmittal letter;

11. Regrets the cancellation of the meeting on security guarantees planned
for July 2005 and expects that such a meeting with the full participation of both
sides will be held as soon as possible;

strengthen the implementation of the Moscow agreement on ceasefire and separation
of forces of 1994;

process in all its major aspects, including their work in the Coordinating Council
and its relevant mechanisms, to build on the results of the Yalta meeting on
confidence-building measures in March 2001 (S/2001/242) and to implement the
proposals agreed on that occasion in a purposeful and cooperative manner, with a
view to holding a fourth conference on confidence-building measures, and
welcomes the intention expressed by Germany to host such a meeting on economic
cooperation and confidence-building measures pending progress in the conflict
resolution process;

14. Welcomes the positive developments towards the reopening of the
railways between Sochi and Tbilisi and towards the return of refugees and internally
displaced persons;

15. Notes that contacts at the level of civil society can reinforce mutual
confidence and calls on both sides to facilitate such contacts;

16. Stresses the urgent need for progress on the question of the refugees and

make returns the focus of special attention and to undertake this task in close
coordination with UNOMIG and consultations with UNHCR and the Group of
Friends;

17. Calls for the rapid finalization and signature of the letter of intent on
returns proposed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and
welcomes the meetings with the participation of the SRSG and UNHCR of the Sochi
working group on refugees and internally displaced persons;

18. Reaffirms the unacceptability of the demographic changes resulting from
the conflict, reaffirms also the inalienable rights of all refugees and internally
displaced persons affected by the conflict, and stresses that they have the right to
return to their homes in secure and dignified conditions, in accordance with
international law and as set out in the Quadripartite Agreement of 4 April 1994
(S/1994/397, annex II) and the Yalta Declaration;

Joint Assessment Mission to the Gali sector (November 2000), regrets that there has
been no progress to that effect despite the positive consideration by the parties given
to those recommendations in the first Geneva meeting and calls again upon the
Abkhaz side to agree to the opening as soon as possible of the Gali branch of the
human rights office in Sukhumi and to provide security conditions for its
unhindered functioning;

22. Reiterates its concern that despite the start of the deployment of a
civilian police component as part of UNOMIG, as endorsed in resolution 1494



4

S/2005/492

(2003) and agreed by the parties, the deployment of the remaining officers in the
Gali sector is still outstanding and calls on the Abkhaz side to allow for a swift
deployment of the police component in that region;

23. Calls in particular on the Abkhaz side to improve law enforcement
protection of the local population and to address the lack of instruction in their
mother tongue for the ethnic Georgian population;

24. Welcomes the measures taken by the Georgian side to put an end to the
activities of illegal armed groups and encourages the maintenance of these efforts;

issues in the Gali district signed on 19 January 2004 and 8 October 2003, to
continue their regular meetings and to cooperate more closely with each other to

participation in the Quadripartite meetings and the Joint Fact Finding Group;

security guarantees to allow for independent and regular monitoring of the situation
in the upper Kodori valley by joint UNOMIG and CIS peacekeeping force patrols;

appropriate security and to ensure the freedom of movement of UNOMIG, the CIS
peacekeeping force and other international personnel and calls upon both sides to
fulfil their obligations in this regard;

30. Strongly condemns in that respect the repeated abductions of personnel of
those missions in the past, deeply deplores that none of the perpetrators have ever
been identified or brought to justice, reiterates that it is the responsibility of the
parties to end this impunity and calls upon them to take action;

31. Also calls upon the parties, once again, to take all necessary steps, to
identify those responsible for the shooting down of a UNOMIG helicopter on
8 October 2001, to bring them to justice, and to inform the SRSG of the steps taken
in particular in the criminal investigation;

32. Welcomes the efforts being undertaken by UNOMIG to implement the
Secretary-General’s zero tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and to
ensure full compliance of its personnel with the United Nations code of conduct,
requests the Secretary-General to continue to take all necessary action in this regard
and to keep the Security Council informed, and urges troop-contributing countries to
take appropriate preventive action including the conduct of predeployment
awareness training, and to take disciplinary action and other action to ensure full
accountability in cases of such conduct involving their personnel;
