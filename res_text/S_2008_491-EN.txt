  Belgium: draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming all its previous resolutions and statements of its President 
pertaining to the situation between Ethiopia and Eritrea, 

 Stressing once again its unwavering commitment to the peace process and to 
the full and expeditious implementation of the Agreement on Cessation of 
Hostilities of 18 June 2000 (S/2000/601) and the Peace Agreement of 12 December 
2000 (S/2000/1183) (hereinafter referred to as “the Algiers Agreements”) as a basis 
for peaceful and cooperative relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea, 

 Considering that Ethiopia and Eritrea bear a shared responsibility in the 
implementation of the Algiers Agreements, in which they agreed that the 
delimitation and demarcation determinations of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary 
Commission (EEBC) shall be final and binding and that their forces shall respect the 
integrity of the Temporary Security Zone (TSZ), 

 Reaffirming that the primary responsibility for achieving a comprehensive and 
lasting settlement of the border dispute and normalizing their relations rests with 
Ethiopia and Eritrea, and that the Security Council stands ready to assist them in 
addressing the underlying fundamental issues, taking into account the interests and 
concerns of both countries, 

 Regretting that Eritrea’s obstructions towards the United Nations Mission in 
Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) reached a level so as to undermine the basis of the 
Mission’s mandate and compelled UNMEE to temporarily relocate from Eritrea, 
stressing that this relocation was without prejudice to the Algiers Agreements and to 
the integrity of the TSZ, and recalling the Security Council’s previous 
condemnation of Eritrea’s lack of cooperation, 

 Commending the efforts made by UNMEE and its military and civilian 
personnel to accomplish its duties, despite the difficult circumstances, and 
expressing its deep appreciation for the contribution and dedication of the troop-
contributing countries to the work of UNMEE, 

 Having considered the special report of the Secretary-General of 7 April 2008 
(S/2008/226), the letters from Ethiopia and Eritrea dated respectively 17 and 
18 June 2008, in response to the letters of the President of the Security Council of 
10 June 2008, and the letter from the Secretary-General of 28 July 2008 



S/2008/491  
 

08-44397 2 
 

(S/2008/496), in response to the letter of the President of the Security Council of 
3 July 2008, 

 1. Decides to terminate UNMEE’s mandate effective on 31 July 2008, 
emphasizes that this termination is without prejudice to Ethiopia and Eritrea’s 
obligations under the Algiers Agreements and calls upon both countries to cooperate 
fully with the United Nations including in the process of liquidation of UNMEE; 

 2. Demands Ethiopia and Eritrea to comply fully with their obligations 
under the Algiers Agreements, to show maximum restraint and refrain from any 
threat or use of force against each other, and to avoid provocative military activities; 

 3. Strongly supports the ongoing efforts by the Secretary-General and the 
international community to engage with Ethiopia and Eritrea to help them to 
implement the Algiers Agreements, to normalize their relations, to promote stability 
between them, and to lay the foundation for a comprehensive and lasting peace 
between them, and urges again Ethiopia and Eritrea to accept the Secretary-
General’s good offices; 

 4. Requests the Secretary-General to further explore with Ethiopia and 
Eritrea the possibility of a United Nations presence in Ethiopia and Eritrea in the 
context of the maintenance of international peace and security; 

 5. Requests the Secretary-General to keep the Council regularly informed of 
the situation between Ethiopia and Eritrea and to make recommendations as 
appropriate; 

 6. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
