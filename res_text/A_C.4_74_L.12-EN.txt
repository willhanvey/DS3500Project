 Deeply concerned about the extremely critical financial situation of the Agency, 

caused by the structural underfunding of the Agency, as well as by rising needs and 

expenditures resulting from the deterioration of the socioeconomic and humanitarian 

conditions and the conflicts and rising instability in the region and their significant 

negative impact on the ability of the Agency to deliver essential services to the 

Palestine refugees, including its emergency, recovery, reconstruction and 

development programmes in all fields of operation, 

 Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on the operations of the 

United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, 3 

submitted pursuant to resolution 71/93 of 6 December 2016, and the request contained 

therein for broad consultations to explore all ways and means, including through 

voluntary and assessed contributions, to ensure that the Agency’s funding is 

sufficient, predictable and sustained for the duration of its mandate, and considering 

the recommendations contained in the report,  

 Taking note also of the report of 31 May 2019 of the Commissioner-General, 

submitted pursuant to paragraph 57 of the report of the Secretary-General and in 

follow-up to the update to the special report of 3 August 2015 of the Commissioner-

General,4 submitted pursuant to paragraph 21 of General Assembly resolution 302 

(IV), regarding the severe financial crisis of the Agency and the negative implications 

for the continued delivery of core Agency programmes to the Palestine refugees in all 

fields of operation, 

 Expressing appreciation for the efforts of donors and host countries to respond 

to the Agency’s unprecedented financial crisis, including through generous, 

additional contributions and, where possible, continued increases in voluntary 

contributions, while acknowledging the steadfast support of all other donors to the 

Agency, 

 Welcoming the contributions made to the Agency’s emergency appeals, 

including for the Gaza Strip and for the Syrian Arab Republic, and calling urgently 

upon the international community to continue its support, since needs persist and 

these appeals remain severely underfunded,  

 Noting that contributions have not been predictable enough or sufficient to meet 

growing needs and remedy the persistent shortfalls, which have, since 2018, been 

exacerbated by the suspension of the single largest voluntary contribution to the 

Agency, undermining the Agency’s operations and efforts to promote human 

development and meet Palestine refugees’ basic needs, and stressing the need for 

further efforts to comprehensively address the recurrent funding shortfalls affecting 

the Agency’s operations, 

 Recognizing the Agency’s extensive efforts to rapidly develop innovative and 

diversified ways to address its financial shortfall and mobilize resources, including 

through the expansion of the donor base and partnerships with international financial 

institutions, the private sector and civil society, including through special digital 

campaigns, 

 Commending the Agency for the measures taken to address the financial crisis, 

despite difficult operational circumstances, including through the implementation of 

the medium-term strategy for 2016–2021 and various internal measures to contain 

expenditures, reduce operational and administrative costs, maximize the use of 

resources and reduce the funding shortfalls, and expressing profound concern that, 

despite such measures, the Agency’s programme budget, which is funded primarily

faces persistent shortfalls that continue to threaten the delivery of the Agency’s core 

programmes of assistance to the Palestine refugees, 

 Encouraging the Agency to sustain those reform efforts, while also taking all 

possible measures to protect and improve the quality of access to and the delivery of 

core programmes of assistance, 

 Recalling its resolution 65/272 of 18 April 2011, in which it requested the 

Secretary-General to continue to support the institutional strengthening of the 

Agency, 

 Stressing the need to support the Agency’s capacity to uphold its mandate and 

to avert the serious humanitarian, political and security risks that would result from 

any interruption or suspension of its vital work,  

 Recognizing that the recurring and growing financial shortfalls directly affecting 

the sustainability of the Agency’s operations need to be remedied by examining new 

funding modalities designed to put the Agency on a stable financial footing to enable 

it to effectively carry out its core programmes in accordance with its mandate and 

commensurate with humanitarian needs,  

 Welcoming the affirmation in the New York Declaration for Refugees and 

Migrants, adopted by the General Assembly on 19 September 2016, 5 that, inter alia, 

the Agency, along with other relevant organizations, requires sufficient funding to be 

able to carry out its activities effectively and in a predictable manner,  

 Bearing in mind the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,6 including the 

pledge that no one will be left behind, emphasizing that the Sustainable Development 

Goals apply to all, including refugees, and commending the efforts of the Agency’s 

programmes to promote 10 of the 17 Goals, as indicated in the report of the Secretary -

General,3  

 Welcoming the joint efforts of host countries and donors to mobilize support for 

the Agency, including through extraordinary ministerial meetings, inter alia, the 

extraordinary ministerial conference held in Rome on 15 March 2018, and the 

ministerial meeting convened at United Nations Headquarters in New York on 

26 September 2019, hosted by Jordan, and Sweden, aimed at urgently addressing the 

Agency’s funding shortfall, expanding donor support for the Agency and reaffirming 

support for its mandate, 

 Welcoming also the establishment, pursuant to the recommendations made by 

the Secretary-General in his report on the operations of the Agency,3 by the 

Organization of Islamic Cooperation at the forty-sixth session of its Council of 

Foreign Ministers, held in Abu Dhabi in March 2019, of a waqf fund at the Islamic 

Development Bank to support Palestine refugees through enhanced support to the 

Agency,

 Aware of the continuing needs of the Palestine refugees in all fields of operation, 

namely Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic and the Occupied Palestinian 

Territory, 

 Gravely concerned about the extremely difficult socioeconomic conditions 

being faced by the Palestine refugees in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 

East Jerusalem, particularly in the refugee camps in the Gaza Strip, as a result of the 

recurrent military operations, continuing prolonged Israeli closures,  the construction 

of settlements and the wall, evictions, the demolition of homes and livelihood 

properties causing forced transfers of civilians, and the severe economic and 

movement restrictions that in effect amount to a blockade, which have deepened 

unemployment and poverty rates among the refugees, with potentially lasting, long -

term negative effects, while taking note of developments with regard to the situation 

of access there, 

 Concerned about plans and measures to interfere with or obstruct the operations 

of the Agency, including in East Jerusalem, contrary to international law and the 

Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, and reiterating

refugees without interference, including in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 

including East Jerusalem,

humanitarian and socioeconomic situation of the Palestine refugees in the Gaza Strip, 

including high rates of food insecurity, poverty, displacement and the depletion of 

coping capacities, 

 Recalling the temporary tripartite agreement facilitated by the United Nations 

in September 2014, and stressing the urgent need for the lifting of all Israeli closures 

and restrictions on the Gaza Strip,  

 Recalling also its resolution ES-10/18 of 16 January 2009 and Security Council 

resolution 1860 (2009) of 8 January 2009, as well as the Agreement on Movement 

and Access of 15 November 2005, 

 Expressing concern about the continuing classroom shortage, including in the 

Gaza Strip, and the consequent negative impact on the right to education of refugee 

children, 

 Stressing the urgent need for the advancement of reconstruction in the Gaza 

Strip, including by ensuring the timely facilitation of construction proje cts, including 

extensive shelter repair, and the need for the accelerated implementation of other 

urgent United Nations-led civilian reconstruction activities, and calling upon Israel

Conference on Palestine: Reconstructing Gaza, held on 12 October 2014, for ensuring 

the provision of the necessary humanitarian assistance and accelerating the 

reconstruction, rehabilitation and recovery process,  

 Stressing that the situation in the Gaza Strip is unsustainable and that a durable 

ceasefire agreement must lead to a fundamental improvement in the living conditions 

of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip, including through the sustained and 

regular opening of crossing points, and must ensure the safety and well-being of 

civilians on both sides,

non-discrimination and non-refoulement under international law, and recalling in this 

regard the statement by the President of the Security Council of 2 October 2013 10 and 

the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants,  

 Aware of the valuable work done by the Agency in providing protection to the 

Palestinian people, in particular Palestine refugees, and recalling the need for the 

protection of all civilians in situations of armed conflict,  

 Deploring the endangerment of the safety of the Agency’s staff and the damage 

and destruction caused to the facilities and properties of the Agency during the period 

covered by the report of the Commissioner-General, and stressing the need to 

maintain the neutrality and safeguard the inviolability of United Nations premises, 

installations and equipment at all times, 

 Deploring also the breaches of the inviolability of United Nations premises, the 

failure to accord the property and assets of the Organization immunity from any form 

of interference, incursions or misuse, the failure to protect United Nations personnel, 

premises and property and any disruption caused to Agency operations by such 

violations, 

 Deploring further all attacks affecting United Nations installations, including 

Agency schools sheltering displaced civilians, and all other breaches of the 

inviolability of United Nations premises, including during the conflict in the Gaza

of the report of the Board of Inquiry11 and by the independent commission of inquiry
