1996,

Stressing that a universal and effectively verifiable Comprehensive Nuclear-

disarmament and non-proliferation,

Encouraged by the signing of the Treaty by one hundred and seventy-three
States, including forty-one of the forty-four needed for its entry into force, and
welcoming the ratification of one hundred and nineteen States, including thirty-three

2004,

1. Stresses the importance and urgency of signature and ratification, without

Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty;

2. Welcomes the contributions by the States signatories to the work of the
Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty
Organization, in particular its efforts to ensure that the Treaty’s verification regime
will be capable of meeting the verification requirements of the Treaty upon its entry
into force, in accordance with article IV of the Treaty;

3. Underlines the need to maintain momentum towards completion of the
verification regime;

4. Calls upon all States to maintain their moratoriums on nuclear-weapons

defeat the object and purpose of the Treaty;

5. Also calls upon all States that have not yet signed the Treaty to sign and
ratify it as soon as possible;

6. Further calls upon all States that have signed but not yet ratified the

accelerate their ratification processes with a view to their earliest successful
conclusion;

7. Urges all States to remain seized of the issue at the highest political
level;

8. Requests the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Preparatory
Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, to
prepare a report on the efforts of States that have ratified the Treaty towards its
universalization and possibilities for providing assistance on ratification procedures
to States that so request it, and to submit such a report to the General Assembly at
its sixtieth session;
