Draft resolution

The Security Council,

Recalling its resolutions 1132 (1997) of 8 October 1997, 1171 (1998) of 5 June
1998, 1306 (2000) of 5 July 2000 and its other resolutions and statements of its
President on the situation in Sierra Leone and the region,

Welcoming General Assembly resolution A/RES/55/56 of 1 December 2000, in
particular its call for measures engaging all concerned parties including diamond
producing, processing, exporting and importing countries as well as the diamond
industry to break the link between diamonds and armed conflict, and its call upon all
States to implement fully Security Council measures targeting the link between the
trade in conflict diamonds and the supply to rebel movements of weapons, fuel or
other prohibited materiel,

Taking note of the report of the United Nations Panel of Experts established
pursuant to paragraph 19 of resolution 1306 (2000) in relation to Sierra Leone
(S/2000/1195),

Taking note of the findings of the Panel of Experts that diamonds represent a
major and primary source of income for the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), that
the bulk of RUF diamonds leave Sierra Leone through Liberia, and that such illicit
trade cannot be conducted without the permission and involvement of Liberian
government officials at the highest levels, and expressing its deep concern at the
unequivocal and overwhelming evidence presented by the report of the Panel of
Experts that the Government of Liberia is actively supporting the RUF at all levels,

Recalling the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
Moratorium on the Importation, Exportation and Manufacture of Small Arms and
Light Weapons in West Africa adopted in Abuja on 31 October 1998 (S/1998/1194,
annex),

Taking note of the measures announced by the Government of Liberia since the
publication of the report of the Panel of Experts established pursuant to resolution
1306 (2000), and welcoming the intention of ECOWAS to monitor their
implementation in close cooperation with the United Nations and to report thereon
after a period of two months,

Recalling its concern already expressed in resolution 1306 (2000) at the role
played by the illicit diamond trade in fuelling the conflict in Sierra Leone and at
reports that such diamonds transit neighbouring countries, including Liberia,

S/2001/188

Reiterating its call made in the statement of its President of 21 December 2000
(S/PRST/2000/41) on all States in West Africa, particularly Liberia, immediately to
cease military support for armed groups in neighbouring countries and prevent
armed individuals from using their national territory to prepare and commit attacks
in neighbouring countries,

Determining that the active support provided by the Government of Liberia for
armed rebel groups in neighbouring countries, and in particular its support for the
RUF in Sierra Leone, constitutes a threat to international peace and security in the
region,

Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,

A

Recalling its resolutions 788 (1992) of 19 November 1992 and 985 (1995) of
13 April 1995,

Noting that the conflict in Liberia has been resolved, that national elections
have taken place within the framework of the Yamoussoukro IV Agreement of
30 October 1991 (S/24815, annex) and that the Final Communiqué of the informal
consultative group meeting of ECOWAS Committee of Five on Liberia issued in
Geneva on 7 April 1992 (S/23863) has been implemented, and determining therefore
that the embargo imposed by paragraph 8 of resolution 788 (1992) should be
terminated,

resolution 788 (1992) and to dissolve the Committee established under resolution

for the RUF in Sierra Leone and for other armed rebel groups in the region, and in
particular take the following concrete steps:

(a) expel all RUF members from Liberia, including such individuals as are
listed by the Committee established by paragraph 14 below, and prohibit all RUF
activities on its territory, provided that nothing in this paragraph shall oblige Liberia
to expel its own nationals from its territory;

(b) cease all financial and, in accordance with resolution 1171 (1998),
military support to the RUF, including all transfers of arms and ammunition, all
military training and the provision of logistical and communications support, and
take steps to ensure that no such support is provided from the territory of Liberia or
by its nationals;

(c) cease all direct or indirect import of Sierra Leone rough diamonds which
are not controlled through the Certificate of Origin regime of the Government of
Sierra Leone, in accordance with resolution 1306 (2000);

(d) freeze funds or financial resources or assets that are made available by its
nationals or within its territory directly or indirectly for the benefit of the RUF or
entities owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the RUF;

S/2001/188

(e) ground all Liberia-registered aircraft operating within its jurisdiction
until it updates its register of aircraft pursuant to Annex VII to the Chicago
Convention on International Civil Aviation of 1944 and provides to the Council the
updated information concerning the registration and ownership of each aircraft
registered in Liberia;

3. Stresses that the demands in paragraph 2 above are intended to lead to
further progress in the peace process in Sierra Leone, and, in that regard, calls upon
the President of Liberia to help ensure that the RUF meet the following objectives:

(a) allow the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) free
access throughout Sierra Leone;

(b) release all abductees;

(c) enter their fighters in the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration
process;

(d) return all weapons and other equipment seized from UNAMSIL;

4. Demands that all States in the region take action to prevent armed
individuals and groups from using their territory to prepare and commit attacks on
neighbouring countries and refrain from any action that might contribute to further
destabilization of the situation on the borders between Guinea, Liberia and Sierra
Leone;

5. (a) Decides that all States shall take the necessary measures to prevent the
sale or supply to Liberia, by their nationals or from their territories or using their
flag vessels or aircraft, of arms and related materiel of all types, including weapons
and ammunition, military vehicles and equipment, paramilitary equipment and spare
parts for the aforementioned, whether or not originating in their territories;

(b) Decides that all States shall take the necessary measures to prevent any
provision to Liberia by their nationals or from their territories of technical training
or assistance related to the provision, manufacture, maintenance or use of the items
in subparagraph (a) above;

(c) Decides that the measures imposed by subparagraphs (a) and (b) above

6. Decides further that all States shall take the necessary measures to
prevent the direct or indirect import of all rough diamonds from Liberia, whether or
not such diamonds originated in Liberia;

7. (a) Decides also that all States shall take the necessary measures to prevent
the entry into or transit through their territories of senior members of the
Government of Liberia and its armed forces and their spouses and any other
individuals providing financial and military support to armed rebel groups in



4

S/2001/188

countries neighbouring Liberia, in particular the RUF in Sierra Leone, as designated
by the Committee established by paragraph 14 below, provided that nothing in this
paragraph shall oblige a State to refuse entry into its territory to its own nationals,
and provided that nothing in this paragraph shall impede the transit of
representatives of the Government of Liberia to United Nations Headquarters to
conduct United Nations business or the participation of the Government of Liberia
in the official meetings of the Mano River Union, ECOWAS and the Organization of
African Unity;

(b) Decides that the measures imposed by subparagraph (a) above shall not
apply where the Committee established by paragraph 14 below determines that such
travel is justified on the grounds of humanitarian need, including religious
obligation, or where the Committee concludes that exemption would otherwise
promote Liberian compliance with the demands of the Council, or assist in the
peaceful resolution of the conflict in the subregion;

8. Further decides that the measures imposed by paragraphs 6 and 7 above
shall come into force at 00.01 Eastern Daylight Time two months after the date of
