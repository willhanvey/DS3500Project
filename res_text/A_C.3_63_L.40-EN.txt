  Situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Guided by the Charter of the United Nations, as well as the Universal

other international human rights instruments, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions on the situation of human rights in the

2007, 

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran,3 submitted pursuant to General 
Assembly resolution 62/168, which highlights a broad range of serious human rights 
violations, legal and institutional gaps and impediments to the protection of human 
rights and which discusses some positive developments in a few areas; 

 2. Expresses its deep concern at serious human rights violations in the 
Islamic Republic of Iran relating to, inter alia: 

 (a) Torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
including flogging and amputations;

 (b) The continuing high incidence of executions carried out in the absence of 
internationally recognized safeguards, including public executions and executions of 
juveniles; 

 (c) Persons in prison who continue to face sentences of execution by 
stoning; 

 (d) Arrests, violent repression and sentencing of women exercising their 
right to peaceful assembly, a campaign of intimidation against women’s human 
rights defenders, and continuing discrimination against women and girls in law and 
in practice; 

 (e) Increasing discrimination and other human rights violations against 
persons belonging to religious, ethnic, linguistic or other minorities, recognized or 
otherwise, including, inter alia, Arabs, Azeris, Baluchis, Kurds, Christians, Jews, 
Sufis and Sunni Muslims and their defenders, and, in particular, attacks on Baha’is 
and their faith in State-sponsored media, increasing evidence of efforts by the State to 
identify and monitor Baha’is, preventing members of the Baha’i faith from attending 
university and from sustaining themselves economically, and the arrest and detention 
of seven Baha’i leaders without charge or access to legal representation; 

 (f) Ongoing, systemic and serious restrictions of freedom of peaceful 
assembly and association and freedom of opinion and expression, including those 
imposed on the media, Internet users and trade unions, and increasing harassment, 
intimidation and persecution of political opponents and human rights defenders 
from all sectors of Iranian society, including arrests and violent repression of labour 
leaders, labour members peacefully assembling and students, in particular with 
regard to the 2008 Majles electoral process; 

 (g) Severe limitations and restrictions on freedom of religion and belief, 
including the provision in the proposed draft penal code that sets out a mandatory 
death sentence for apostasy; 

 (h) Persistent failure to uphold due process of law rights, and violation of the 
rights of detainees, including the systematic and arbitrary use of prolonged solitary 
confinement; 

 3. Calls upon the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to address the 
substantive concerns highlighted in the report of the Secretary-General and the 
specific calls to action found in previous resolutions of the General Assembly, and 
to respect fully its human rights obligations, in law and in practice, in particular: 

 (a) To eliminate, in law and in practice, amputations, flogging and other 
forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; 

 (b) To abolish, in law and in practice, public executions and other executions 
carried out in the absence of respect for internationally recognized safeguards; 

 (c) To abolish, pursuant to its obligations under article 37 of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child4 and article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights,5 executions of persons who at the time of their offence were under 
the age of 18;

 (e) To eliminate, in law and in practice, all forms of discrimination and other 
human rights violations against women and girls; 

 (f) To eliminate, in law and in practice, all forms of discrimination and other 
human rights violations against persons belonging to religious, ethnic, linguistic or 
other minorities, recognized or otherwise, to refrain from monitoring individuals on 
the basis of their religious beliefs, and to ensure that access of minorities to 
education and employment is on par with that of all Iranians; 

 (g) To implement, inter alia, the 1996 report of the Special Rapporteur on 
religious intolerance,6 which recommended ways in which the Islamic Republic of 
Iran could emancipate the Baha’i community; 

 (h) To end the harassment, intimidation and persecution of political 
opponents and human rights defenders, including by releasing persons imprisoned 
arbitrarily or on the basis of their political views; 

 (i) To uphold due process of law rights and to end impunity for human rights 
violations; 

 4. Notes the positive although limited gains, developments and steps 
discussed in the report of the Secretary-General, but remains concerned that many 
such steps have yet to be implemented in law or in practice; 

 5. Further calls upon the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to 
redress its inadequate record of cooperation with international human rights 
mechanisms by, inter alia, reporting pursuant to its obligations to the treaty bodies 
of the instruments to which it is a party and cooperating fully with all international 
human rights mechanisms, including facilitating visits to its territory of special 
procedures mandate holders, and encourages the Government of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran to continue exploring cooperation on human rights and justice 
reform with the United Nations, including the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights; 

 6. Requests an update from the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, including its cooperation with international 
human rights mechanisms, at its sixty-fourth session;
