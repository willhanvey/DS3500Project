  Developments in the field of information and telecommunications 
in the context of international security 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 53/70 of 4 December 1998, 54/49 of 1 December 
1999, 55/28 of 20 November 2000, 56/19 of 29 November 2001, 57/53 of

8 December 2005, 61/54 of 6 December 2006 and 62/17 of 5 December 2007, 

 Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the 
context of international security, in which, inter alia, it recognized that scientific and 
technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and 
that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be 
maintained and encouraged, 

 Noting that considerable progress has been achieved in developing and 
applying the latest information technologies and means of telecommunication, 

 Affirming that it sees in this process the broadest positive opportunities for the 
further development of civilization, the expansion of opportunities for cooperation 
for the common good of all States, the enhancement of the creative potential of 
humankind and additional improvements in the circulation of information in the 
global community, 

 Recalling, in this connection, the approaches and principles outlined at the 
Information Society and Development Conference, held in Midrand, South Africa, 
from 13 to 15 May 1996, 



A/C.1/63/L.45  
 

08-55840 2 
 

 Bearing in mind the results of the Ministerial Conference on Terrorism, held in 
Paris on 30 July 1996, and the recommendations that it made,1 

 Bearing in mind also the results of the World Summit on the Information 
Society, held in Geneva from 10 to 12 December 2003 (first phase) and in Tunis 
from 16 to 18 November 2005 (second phase),2 

 Noting that the dissemination and use of information technologies and means 
affect the interests of the entire international community and that optimum 
effectiveness is enhanced by broad international cooperation, 

 Expressing its concern that these technologies and means can potentially be 
used for purposes that are inconsistent with the objectives of maintaining 
international stability and security and may adversely affect the integrity of the 
infrastructure of States to the detriment of their security in both civil and military 
fields, 

 Considering that it is necessary to prevent the use of information resources or 
technologies for criminal or terrorist purposes, 

 Noting the contribution of those Member States that have submitted their 
assessments on issues of information security to the Secretary-General pursuant to 
paragraphs 1 to 3 of resolutions 53/70, 54/49, 55/28, 56/19, 57/53, 58/32, 59/61, 
60/45, 61/54 and 62/17, 

 Taking note of the reports of the Secretary-General containing those 
assessments,3 

 Welcoming the initiative taken by the Secretariat and the United Nations 
Institute for Disarmament Research in convening international meetings of experts 
in Geneva in August 1999 and April 2008 on developments in the field of 
information and telecommunications in the context of international security, as well 
as its results, 

 Considering that the assessments of the Member States contained in the 
reports of the Secretary-General and the international meetings of experts have 
contributed to a better understanding of the substance of issues of international 
information security and related notions, 

 Bearing in mind that the Secretary-General, in fulfilment of resolution 58/32, 
established in 2004 a group of governmental experts, which, in accordance with its 
mandate, considered existing and potential threats in the sphere of information 
security and possible cooperative measures to address them and conducted a study 
on relevant international concepts aimed at strengthening the security of global 
information and telecommunications systems, 

 Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on the Group of 
Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and
