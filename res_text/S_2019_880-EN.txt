prevent destabilising effects of regional disputes from spilling over into Somalia,  

 Expressing its support for the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS)  in their 

efforts to reconstruct the country, counter the threat of terrorism and tackle the flow 

of illegal arms and armed groups, further expressing its intention to ensure the arms 

embargo in this resolution will enable the FGS in the realisation of the se objectives, 

and noting its intention to set out all of the provisions of the arms embargo in this 

text, 

 Condemning Al-Shabaab attacks in Somalia and beyond, expressing grave 

concern that Al-Shabaab continues to pose a serious threat to the peace, security and 

stability of Somalia and the region, particularly through their increased use of 

improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and further expressing grave concern at the 

continued presence in Somalia of affiliates linked to Islamic State in Iraq and the 

Levant (ISIL also known as Da’esh), 

 Reaffirming the need to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of 

the United Nations and international law, including applicable international human 

rights law, international refugee law, and international humanitarian law, threats to 

international peace and security caused by terrorist acts, 

 Condemning any flows of weapons and ammunition supplies to and through 

Somalia in violation of the arms embargo, including when they result in supplies to 

Al-Shabaab and affiliates linked to ISIL, and when they undermine the sovereignty 

and territorial integrity of Somalia as a serious threat to peace and stability in the 

region, and further condemning continued illegal flows of weapons and ammunition 

from Yemen to Somalia, 

 Expressing serious concern at reports of increased exploitation of Somalia, by 

Al-Shabaab and transnational organized crime networks, as a transit and transhipment 

point for the trade in sub-standard, illicit and dual-use goods and the revenues this 

trade generates for Al-Shabaab, and further expressing concern at continued reports 

of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in waters where Somalia has 

jurisdiction, and encourages the FGS, with support from the international community,

to ensure fishing licenses are issued in accordance with the appropriate Somali 

legislation, 

 Reiterating the importance of co-operation and coordination between the FGS 

and the Federal Member States (FMS) and implementation of the National Security 

Architecture and noting that a successful transition to Somali-led security from the 

African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) as set out under the Transition Plan is 

fundamental to the maintenance of peace and stability in the region, 

 Expressing concern at the continued reports of corruption and diversion of 

public resources in Somalia, welcoming efforts made by the FGS to reduce corruption 

including the enactment of the Anti-Corruption Law on 21 September 2019, progress 

made by the FGS in strengthening public financial management and the positive work 

of the Financial Reporting Centre, and calling for the FGS to continue its efforts to 

address corruption and to continue to accelerate the pace of reform,  

 Expressing serious concern at the humanitarian situation in Somalia, and 

condemning in the strongest terms any party obstructing the safe delivery of 

humanitarian assistance, any misappropriation or diversion of any humanitarian funds 

or supplies, and acts of violence against and harassment of humanitarian workers,  

 Further expressing serious concern over the widespread nature and persistence 

of sexual and gender-based violence in Somalia, and encouraging the Somali 

authorities to further strengthen efforts to address it, including by implementing 

measures in line with resolution 2467 (2019),

been cooperating with the Panel during the majority of their mandate, welcoming the 

FGS’s collaboration and active participation with the technical assessment team on

recalling that panels of experts operate pursuant to mandates from the Security

international peace and security in the region,
