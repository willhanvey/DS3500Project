  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 

draft resolution  
 

 

 The Security Council,  

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 28 November 2017 on the 

Strategic Review of the United Nations Force in Cyprus (S/2017/1008), of 

28 September 2017 on his Good Offices (S/2017/814) and of 9 January 2018 

(S/2018/25) on the United Nations operation in Cyprus,  

 Noting that the Government of Cyprus is agreed that in view of the prevailing 

conditions on the island it is necessary to keep the United Nations Peacekeeping Force 

in Cyprus (UNFICYP) beyond 31 January 2018,  

 Echoing the Secretary-General’s firm belief that the responsibility for finding a 

solution lies first and foremost with the Cypriots themselves, and reaffirming the 

primary role of the United Nations in assisting the parties to bring the Cyprus conflict 

and division of the island to a comprehensive and durable settlement,  

 Welcoming the commitments set out in the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot 

leaders’ Joint Statement of 2 April 2017 on the basis of the Joint Declaration adopted 

on 11 February 2014, further welcoming the progress in negotiations since then, 

including the reconvening of the Conference on Cyprus under United Nations 

auspices in June 2017, the participants’ commitment to support the process towards a 

comprehensive settlement in Cyprus, and the support provided by the Secretary-

General and Secretary-General’s Special Representative Elizabeth Spehar,  

 Recalling the importance attached by the international community to all parties 

engaging fully, flexibly and constructively in negotiations to secure a settlement and 

noting that last year’s Conference on Cyprus did not result in an enduring, 

comprehensive and just settlement based on a bicommunal, bizonal federation with 

political equality, as set out in relevant Security Council resolutions, urging the sides 

to renew their commitment to such a settlement, and stressing that the status quo is 

unsustainable,  

 Noting the need to advance the consideration of and discussions on military 

confidence-building measures, calling for renewed efforts to implement all remaining 

confidence-building measures, and for agreement on and implementation of further 

steps to build trust between the communities,  

 Reaffirming the importance of continued crossings of the Green Line by 

Cypriots, and encouraging the opening by mutual agreement of other crossing points,

 Convinced of the many important benefits, including economic benefits for all 

Cypriots, that would flow from a comprehensive and durable Cyprus settlement, 

urging the two sides and their leaders to foster positive public rhetoric, and 

encouraging them clearly to explain the benefits of the settlement, as well as the need 

for increased flexibility and compromise in order to secure it, to both communities 

well in advance of any referenda,  

 Highlighting the importance, both political and financial, of the supporting role 

of the international community, and in particular that of all parties concerned in taking 

practical steps towards helping the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders to 

renew their commitment to a settlement under United Nations auspices; taking note 

of the assessment of the Secretary-General that the security situation on the island 

and along the Green Line remains stable, and urging all sides to avoid any action, 

including violations of the military status quo, which could lead to an increase in 

tension, undermine the progress achieved so far, or damage the goodwill on the island,  

 Recalling the Secretary-General’s firm belief that the situation in the buffer zone 

would be improved if both sides accepted the 1989 aide-memoire used by the United 

Nations,  

 Noting with regret that the sides are withholding access to the remaining 

minefields in the buffer zone, and that demining in Cyprus must continue, noting the 

continued danger posed by mines in Cyprus, noting also proposals and discussions as 

well as positive initiatives on demining, and urging rapid agreement on facilitating 

the recommencement of demining operations and clearance of the remaining 

minefields,  

 Commending the work of the Committee on Missing Persons, highlighting the 

importance of intensifying its activities, and therefore the need to provide all 

information required as expressed in the press release of the Committee on Missing 

Persons on 28 July 2016 regarding review of archival materials, noting that the 

remains of 1,147 missing persons, from a total of 2002, have not yet been positively 

identified, urging the opening up of access to all areas expeditiously to allow the 

Committee to carry out its work, and trusting that this process will promote 

reconciliation between the communities,  

 Agreeing that the active participation and leadership of women is essential to 

the political process and can contribute to making any future settlement sustainable, 

recalling that women play a critically important role in peace processes as recognised 

in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, and related resolutions; and 

further recalling the importance of the active participation of youth, consistent with 

Resolution 2250,  

 Urging the sides to step up their efforts to promote intercommunal contacts and 

events and the active engagement of civil society, including Bi-Communal Initiatives 

and development projects where the two communities can work together and jointly 

benefit, and the encouragement of cooperation between economic and co mmercial 

bodies and to remove all obstacles to such contacts,  

 Stressing the need for the Council to pursue a rigorous, strategic approach to 

peacekeeping deployments,  

 Recognizing the need to regularly review all peacekeeping operations to ensure 

efficiency and effectiveness, and noting the importance of transition planning in 

relation to the settlement, including recommendations as appropriate for further 

adjustments to the mandate of UNFICYP, force levels and other resources and concept 

of operations, taking into account developments on the ground and the views of the 

parties,

3/4 18-01375 

 

 Noting with appreciation the efforts of the Secretary-General and Special 

Representative Elizabeth Spehar,  

 Echoing the Secretary-General’s gratitude to the Government of Cyprus and the 

Government of Greece for their voluntary contributions to the funding of UNFICYP, 

and his request for further voluntary contributions from other countries and 

organizations, and expressing appreciation to Member States that contribute 

personnel to UNFICYP,
