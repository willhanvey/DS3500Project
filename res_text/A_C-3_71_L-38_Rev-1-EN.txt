frameworks of accountability in relation to extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 

executions during armed conflict,  

 Recalling all its resolutions on the subject of extrajudicial, summary or 

arbitrary executions as well as the resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights 

and the Human Rights Council on the subject, and emphasizing the importance o f 

their full and effective implementation,  

 Recognizing the positive role that regional human rights systems can play in 

the global protection against arbitrary deprivation of life,   

 Acknowledging the importance of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

Development
5
 and its implementation for the promotion and protection of the 

enjoyment by all persons of human rights, gender equality, access to justice for all 

and effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels,   

 Noting with deep concern that impunity continues to be a major cause of the 

perpetuation of violations of human rights, including extrajudicial, summary or 

arbitrary executions,  

 Noting that enforced disappearances can end up in extrajudicial, summary or 

arbitrary executions, recalling the importance in this regard of the International 

Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance,
6
 and 

calling upon all States which have not yet done so to consider signing and ratifying 

or acceding to the Convention,  

 Acknowledging that international human rights law and international 

humanitarian law are complementary and mutually reinforcing,   

 Noting with deep concern the growing number of civilians and persons hors de 

combat killed in situations of armed conflict and internal strife, and that women and 

girls are disproportionately affected by conflict, as recognized in Security Council 

resolution 1325 (2000) of 31 October 2000 on women and peace and security and 

subsequent resolutions on the matter,  

 Noting also with deep concern the continuing instances of the arbitrary 

deprivation of life, resulting from, inter alia, the imposition and implementation of 

capital punishment when carried out in a manner that violates international law,   

 Recalling the United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and 

Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders (the Bangkok Rules)
7
 and the 

adoption of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of 

Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules),

 Deeply concerned also about killings committed by non-State actors, including 

terrorist groups and criminal organizations, which may amount to abuses of 

international human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law,   

 Acknowledging that extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions may under 

certain circumstances amount to genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes, 

as defined in international law, including in the Rome Statute of the International 

Criminal Court,
9
 and recalling in this regard that each individual State has the 

responsibility to protect its populations from such crimes, as set out by the General 

Assembly in its resolutions 60/1 of 16 September 2005 and 63/308 of 14 September 

2009,  

 Convinced of the need for effective action to prevent, combat and eliminate 

the abhorrent practice of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, which 

represent flagrant violations of international human rights law, particularly the right 

to life, as well as of international humanitarian law,  

 1. Reiterates its strong condemnation of all the extrajudicial, summary or 

arbitrary executions that continue to occur throughout the world;   

 2. Demands that all States ensure that the practice of extrajudicial, 

summary or arbitrary executions is brought to an end and that they take effective 

action to prevent, combat and eliminate the phenomenon in all its forms and 

manifestations;  

 3. Reiterates that all States must conduct prompt, exhaustive and impartial 

investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 

executions, identify and bring to justice those responsible, while ensuring the right 

of every person to a fair hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal 

established by law, grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the 

victims or their families and adopt all necessary measures, including legal and 

judicial measures, also bearing in mind gender equality in access to justice, to put 

an end to impunity and prevent the further occurrence of such executions, as 

recommended in the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of 

Extralegal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions,
10

 fully consistent with their 

obligations under international law;  

 4. Calls upon Governments, and invites intergovernmental and 

non-governmental organizations, to pay greater attention to the work of national -

level commissions of inquiry into extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, 

with a view to ensuring the effective contribution of these commissions to 

accountability and to combating impunity;  

 5. Calls upon all States, in order to prevent extrajudicial, summary or 

arbitrary executions, to comply with their obligations under the relevant provisions 

of international human rights instruments, and also calls upon States which retain 

the death penalty to pay particular regard to the provisions contained in articles 6, 

14 and 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
2
 and articles 

37 and 40 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child,

civil unrest, public emergencies or armed conflicts and to ensure that the police, law 

enforcement agents, armed forces and other agents acting on behalf of or with the 

consent or acquiescence of the State act with restraint and in conformity with 

international human rights law and international humanitarian law, including the 

principles of proportionality and necessity, and in this regard to ensure that police 

and law enforcement officials are guided by the Code of Conduct for Law 

Enforcement Officials
13

 and the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms 

by Law Enforcement Officials;
14

  

 (b) To ensure the effective protection of the right to life of all persons, to 

conduct, when required by obligations under international law, prompt, exhaustive 

and impartial investigations into all killings, including those targeted at specific 

groups of persons, such as racially motivated violence leading to the death of the 

victim, killings of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic 

minorities or because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, killings of 

persons affected by terrorism or hostage-taking or living under foreign occupation, 

killings of refugees, internally displaced persons, migrants, street children or 

members of indigenous communities, killings of persons for reasons related to their 

activities as human rights defenders, lawyers, journalists or demonst rators, killings 

committed in the name of passion or in the name of honour and killings committed 

for discriminatory reasons on any basis, to bring those responsible to justice before 

a competent, independent and impartial judiciary at the national or, whe re

committed by security forces, police and law enforcement agents, paramilitary 

groups or private forces, are neither condoned nor sanctioned by State officials or 

personnel;  

 7. Affirms the obligation of States, in order to prevent extrajudicial, 

summary or arbitrary executions, to protect the lives of all persons deprived of their 

liberty in all circumstances and to investigate and respond to deaths in custody;
