I. INTRODUCTION 

1. The recommendations of the Fifth Committee to the General Assembly heretofore 
made under agenda item 113 (a) during the current session are contained in parts I 
and II of the present report (A/33/346 and Add.l). Pursuant to those 
recommendations, the General Assembly, at its 44th plenary meeting, on 
3 November 1978, adopted resolution 33/13 A on the basis of part I, and at its 
68th plenary meeting on 1 December 1978, adopted resolution 33/13 Bon the basis 
of part II. 

2. The Committee considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing 
of the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) and of the United Nations 
Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) (A/33/373 and Corr.l) at its 47th, 48th and 
49th meetings on 30 November, 1 and 4 December; it also had before it the related 
report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions 
(A/33/391 and Corr.l). 

3. In his report (A/33/373 and Corr.l), the Secretary-General estimated the 
costs of the operation of UNEF for the nine-month period from 25 October 1978 to 
24 July 1979 inclusive at $59,902,000 and income from staff assessment at 
$743,000, based on a troop strength of 4,200 and on continuance of its existing 
area of operations and responsibilities. Should the Security Council renew the 
mandate of UNEF beyond 24 J·uly 1979 and assuming continuance of the existing

strength and responsibilities of the Force, the costs of UNEF would be of the 
order of $6,214,000 per month from 25 July 1979 onwards. The Secretary-General 
estimated the costs of the operation of UNDOF for the period from 25 October 1978 
to 24 October 1979 inclusive at $20,781,000 and income from staff assessment 
at $202,000, based on a troop strength of 1,160 and on continuance of its 
existing area of operations and responsibilities. 

4. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, in 
paragraphs 14, 22, 23 and 25 to 27 of its report (A/33/391), indicated that savings 
totalling $2.3 million should be within reach with respect to the estimates of 
the Secretary-General and, as set out in paragraph 28 of its report, that 
miscellaneous income of $130,000 would be realized from the sale of obsolete or 
surplus equipment, stores, etc. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee recommended 
that the budgets for UNEF for the nine-month period from 25 October 1978 to 
24 July 1979 and for UNDOF for the 12-month period from 25 October 1978 to 
24 October 1979 should not exceed an aggregate of $77,308,000 net of staff 
assessment ($945,000) and miscellaneous income ($130,000).
