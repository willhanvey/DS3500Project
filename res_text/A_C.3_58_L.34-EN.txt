Convinced that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related
intolerance reveal themselves in a differentiated manner for women and girls and
may be among the factors leading to a deterioration in their living conditions,
poverty, violence, multiple forms of discrimination and the limitation or denial of
their human rights, and recognizing the need to integrate a gender perspective into
relevant policies, strategies and programmes of action against racism, racial
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in order to address multiple
forms of discrimination,

Reaffirming its firm determination and its commitment to eradicate totally and
unconditionally racism and racial discrimination and its conviction that racism and
racial discrimination constitute a negation of the purposes and principles of the
Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,3

Stressing the need for maintaining political will and momentum at the national,
regional and international levels to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia
and related intolerance, taking into account commitments undertaken under the
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, and recalling the importance of
enhancing national action and international cooperation to this end,

Recognizing that the successful implementation of the Programme of Action
requires political will, international cooperation and adequate funding at the
national, regional and international levels,

Deeply concerned that, despite continuing efforts, racism, racial
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and acts of violence persist and
even grow in magnitude, incessantly adopting new forms, including tendencies to
establish policies based on racial, religious, ethnic, cultural and national superiority
or exclusivity,

Alarmed, in particular, at the increase in racist violence and xenophobic ideas
in many parts of the world, in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in
society at large, inter alia, as a result of the resurgent activities of associations
established on the basis of racist and xenophobic platforms and charters, and the
persistent use of those platforms and charters to promote or incite racist ideologies,

Underlining the importance of urgently eliminating continuing and violent
trends involving racism and racial discrimination, and conscious that any form of
impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in
weakening the rule of law and democracy, tends to encourage the recurrence of such
crimes and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication,

Recognizing that States should implement and enforce appropriate and
effective legislative, judicial, regulatory and administrative measures to prevent and
protect against acts of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related
intolerance, thereby contributing to the prevention of human rights violations,

Emphasizing that poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion
and economic disparities are closely associated with racism, racial discrimination,
xenophobia and related intolerance and contribute to the persistence of racist
attitudes and practices, which in turn generate more poverty,
