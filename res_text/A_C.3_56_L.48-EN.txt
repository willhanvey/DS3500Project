Recalling also the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights,4 in which the fundamental right of every person to be
free from hunger is recognized,

Recalling further the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and
Malnutrition,5

Bearing in mind the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Plan of
Action of the World Food Summit, held in Rome from 13 to 17 November 1996,

Reaffirming that all human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent
and interrelated,

Recognizing that the problems of hunger and food insecurity has global
dimensions and that they are likely to persist and even to increase dramatically in
some regions, unless urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, given the
anticipated increase in the world’s population and the stress on natural resources,

Reaffirming that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic
environment, both at a national and an international level, is the essential foundation
which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty
eradication,

Reiterating, as did the Rome Declaration, that food should not be used as an
instrument of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the
importance of international cooperation and solidarity, as well as the necessity of
refraining from unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law
and the Charter of the United Nations and that endanger food security,

Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources
and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations
contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action of the World Food Summit
and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize
collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly
interlinked institutions, societies and economies, where coordinated efforts and
shared responsibilities are essential,

Stressing the importance of reversing the continuing decline of official
development assistance devoted to agriculture, both in real terms and as a share of
total official development assistance,

1. Reaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human
dignity and, therefore, requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national,
regional and international levels for its elimination;

2. Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious
food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of
everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able fully to develop and maintain their
physical and mental capacities;

3. Considers it intolerable that 826 million people, most of them women
and children, throughout the world and particularly in developing countries, do not

have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs, which infringes upon their
fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures on
the environment in ecologically fragile areas;

4. Encourages all States to take steps with a view to achieving
progressively the full realization of the right to food, including steps to promote the
conditions for everyone to be free from hunger and as soon as possible to enjoy fully
the right to food, and to elaborate and adopt national plans to combat hunger;

5. Stresses the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation
and utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including
external debt relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to
implement sustainable food security policies;

6. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and
expenditures to the realization of the right to food;

nurturing of young children merits the highest priority;

8. Takes note with appreciation of the preliminary report of the Special
Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the right to food,6 submitted in
accordance with Commission resolution 2001/25, and commends the Special
Rapporteur for his valuable work in the promotion of the right to food;

9. Supports the realization of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur as
established by the Commission on Human Rights in its resolutions 2000/10 and
2001/25;

10. Emphasizes the request of the Commission on Human Rights to the
Special Rapporteur to contribute effectively to the medium-term review of the
implementation of the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Plan of
Action of the World Food Summit by submitting to the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights his recommendations on all aspects of the right to
food;

11. Encourages the Special Rapporteur to mainstream a gender perspective
in the activities relating to his mandate;

12. Requests the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner to provide
all the necessary human and financial resources for the effective fulfilment of the
mandate of the Special Rapporteur;

13. Welcomes the work already done by the Committee on Economic, Social
and Cultural Rights in promoting the right to adequate food, in particular its General
Comment No. 12 (1999) on the right to adequate food (article 11 of the International
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights),7 in which the Committee
affirmed, inter alia, that the right to adequate food is indivisibly linked to the
inherent dignity of the human person and is indispensable for the fulfilment of other
human rights enshrined in the International Bill of Human Rights and is also
inseparable from social justice, requiring the adoption of appropriate economic,
