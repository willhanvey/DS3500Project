Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United 
States of America: draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its resolution 1617 (2005) requesting increased cooperation between 
the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) and the Committee 
established pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999) (the “1267 Committee”), 

 Recalling also the cooperation agreement of 8 July 1997 between the United 
Nations and Interpol, and the exchange of letters of 8 December 2005 and 5 January 
2006 supplementing the agreement, 

 Welcoming the constructive role that Interpol has played to help the 1267 
Committee fulfil its mandate, inter alia, through the creation of the Interpol-United 
Nations Security Council Special Notices, 

 Noting that such cooperation with Interpol could also benefit the other 
sanctions committees established by the Security Council (the “Committees”), 
further noting that each committee might come up with its own conclusion in this 
regard, 

 Stressing that Security Council sanctions measures are often implemented 
under national law, including criminal law where applicable, and that enhanced 
cooperation between the United Nations and Interpol would enhance States’ 
enforcement of those laws, 

 Emphasizing the obligations placed upon all Member States to implement, in 
full, the mandatory measures adopted by the Security Council, 

 1. Requests the Secretary-General to take the necessary steps to increase 
cooperation between the United Nations and Interpol in order to provide the 
Committees with better tools, to fulfil their mandates more effectively, and to give 
Member States better optional tools to implement those measures adopted by the 
Security Council and monitored by the Committees, as well as similar measures that 
may be adopted by the Security Council in the future, particularly the freezing of 
assets, travel bans, and arms embargoes; 

 2. Encourages Member States to use the tools offered by Interpol, 
particularly the I-24/7 global police communications system, to reinforce the 
implementation of such measures and similar measures that may be adopted by the 
Security Council in the future; 

 3. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
