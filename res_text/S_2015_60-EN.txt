 The Security Council, 

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 9 January 2015 (S/2015/17) 

on the United Nations operation in Cyprus, 

 Noting that the Government of Cyprus is agreed that in view of the prevailing 

conditions on the island it is necessary to keep the United Nations Peacekeeping 

Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) beyond 31 January 2015,  

 Noting the intention of the Secretary-General to report on his Good Offices in 

the next reporting period, and echoing the Secretary-General’s firm belief that the 

responsibility for finding a solution lies first and foremost with the Cypriots 

themselves, and reaffirming the primary role of the United Nations in assisting the 

parties to bring the Cyprus conflict and division of the island to a comprehensive 

and durable settlement, 

 Expressing its support for the ongoing efforts of the Secretary-General’s 

Special Advisor Espen Barth Eide, noting the importance of a conducive 

environment, and calling for the resumption of structured negotiations without 

delay, in a results oriented manner as agreed to in the Joint Declaration adopted by 

the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders on 11 February 2014, and stressing 

the need for renewed efforts of the leaders and negotiators to reach a comprehensive 

settlement as soon as possible, 

 Recalling the importance attached by the international community to all 

parties engaging fully, flexibly and constructively in the negotiations and noting that 

the negotiations have not yet resulted in an enduring, comprehensive and just 

settlement based on a bicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality, as set 

out in the relevant Security Council resolutions, encouraging the sides to intensify 

the substantive negotiations on the unresolved core issues interdependently, and 

stressing that the status quo is unsustainable,  

 Noting the need to advance the consideration of and discussions on military 

confidence building measures, calling for renewed efforts to implement all 

remaining confidence building measures, and for agreement on and implementation 

of further steps to build trust between the communities,  

 Reaffirming the importance of continued crossings of the Green Line by 

Cypriots, and encouraging the opening by mutual agreement of other crossing 

points,

 Convinced of the many important benefits, including economic benefits for all 

Cypriots that would flow from a comprehensive and durable Cyprus settlement, 

urging the two sides and their leaders to foster positive public rhetoric, and 

encouraging them clearly to explain the benefits of the settlement, as well as the 

need for increased flexibility and compromise in order to secure it , to both 

communities well in advance of any eventual referenda,  

 Highlighting the importance of the supporting role of the international 

community, and in particular that of the parties concerned in taking practical steps 

towards helping the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders to exploit fully the 

current opportunity,  

 Taking note of the assessment of the Secretary-General that the security 

situation on the island and along the Green Line remains stable, and urging all sides 

to avoid any action, including violations of the military status quo, which could lead 

to an increase in tension, undermine the progress achieved so far, or damage the 

goodwill on the island, 

 Recalling the Secretary-General’s firm belief that the situation in the buffer 

zone would be improved if both sides accepted the 1989 aide-memoire used by the 

United Nations, 

 Noting with regret that the sides are withholding access to the remaining 

minefields in the buffer zone, and that demining in Cyprus must continue, noting the 

continued danger posed by mines in Cyprus, noting also recent proposals and 

discussions on demining, and urging rapid agreement on facilitating the 

recommencement of demining operations and clearance of the remaining 

minefields, 

 Commending the work of the Committee on Missing Persons, highlighting the 

importance of intensifying its activities, noting that half of all missing persons have 

yet to be located and more than 70% have yet to be identified, urging the opening 

up of access to all areas expeditiously to allow the Committee to carry out its work, 

and trusting that this process will promote reconciliation between the communities,  

 Agreeing that active participation of civil society groups, including women’s 

groups, is essential to the political process and can contribute to making any future 

settlement sustainable, recalling that women play a critically important role in peace 

processes, welcoming all efforts to promote bicommunal contacts and events 

including, inter alia, on the part of all United Nations bodies on the island, and 

urging the two sides to promote the active engagement of civil society and the 

encouragement of cooperation between economic and commercial bodies and to 

remove all obstacles to such contacts, 

 Stressing the need for the Council to pursue a rigorous, strategic approach to 

peacekeeping deployments, 

 Welcoming the intention of the Secretary-General to keep all peacekeeping 

operations under close review to ensure efficiency and effectiveness, including a 

review of UNFICYP when appropriate, and noting the importance of contingency 

planning in relation to the settlement, including recommendations as appropriate for 

further adjustments to UNFICYP’s mandate, force levels and other resources and 

concept of operations, taking into account developments on the ground and the 

views of the parties,
