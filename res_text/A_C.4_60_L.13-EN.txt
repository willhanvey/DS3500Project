A/C.4/60/L.13

Convinced that occupation itself represents a gross and grave violation of
human rights,

Gravely concerned about the continuing detrimental impact of the events that
have taken place since 28 September 2000, including the excessive use of force by
the Israeli occupying forces against Palestinian civilians, resulting in thousands of
deaths and injuries, and the widespread destruction of property,

Having considered the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli
Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of
the Occupied Territories4 and the relevant reports of the Secretary-General,5

Recalling the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government
Arrangements of 13 September 19936 and the subsequent implementation
agreements between the Palestinian and Israeli sides,

Expressing the hope that the Israeli occupation will be brought to an early end
and that therefore the violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people will
cease, and recalling in this regard its resolution 58/292 of 6 May 2004,

1. Commends the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices
Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the
Occupied Territories for its efforts in performing the tasks assigned to it by the
General Assembly and for its impartiality;

2. Reiterates its demand that Israel, the occupying Power, cooperate with
the Special Committee in implementing its mandate;

3. Deplores those policies and practices of Israel that violate the human
rights of the Palestinian people and other Arabs of the occupied territories, as
reflected in the report of the Special Committee covering the reporting period;4

4. Expresses grave concern about the critical situation in the Occupied
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, since 28 September 2000, as a result
of unlawful Israeli practices and measures, and especially condemns all Israeli
settlement activities and the construction of the wall, as well as the excessive and
indiscriminate use of force against the civilian population, including extrajudicial
executions;

5. Requests the Special Committee, pending complete termination of the
Israeli occupation, to continue to investigate Israeli policies and practices in the
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories
occupied by Israel since 1967, especially Israeli violations of the Geneva
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of
12 August 1949,1 and to consult, as appropriate, with the International Committee of
the Red Cross according to its regulations in order to ensure that the welfare and
human rights of the peoples of the occupied territories are safeguarded and to report
to the Secretary-General as soon as possible and whenever the need arises
thereafter;
