measureg to engure the aecurlty of non-nuclear-seapon stateB agalnst the use
or threat of use of nuclear neapons fron any quarter.

Recognizlnq that effactlve measures to assure non-nuclear{eaPon states
agalnst the use oE threat of use of nuclear reapons can con6tltute a posltlve
contributlon to the preventlon of Ehe spread of such ueapons,

Noting with satisfaction the deterElnatlon of non-ntrcIear-weaPon statea
in varlous parts of the t{orlal to prevent nuclear ueapons fron belng lntEoduced

nuclear weapons, that would be tantamount, in Practlce, to bannlng the use of
nuclear weapons against all states, lncludlng all non-nuclear-n€aPon Statest

considering thac, !.n the search for a solutlon to the probleflr of security
asaurances, priority should be glven to tshe leglt,lnate securlty concerns of
