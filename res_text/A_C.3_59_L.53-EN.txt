movement and the Seventh-day Adventist church, to practise their religion;

(b) The release in June 2004 of a number of Jehovah’s Witnesses who had

concern that other Jehovah’s Witnesses continue to be jailed on the same charge;

(c) The comments of President Saparmurat Niyazov in May 2004 that

2. Expresses its grave concern at the continuing and serious human rights
violations occurring in Turkmenistan, in particular:

imprisonment and surveillance of persons who try to exercise their freedoms of
expression, assembly and association, and by harassment of their families;

conscience, religion and belief;

discrimination;

application of the restrictive provisions contained in the 2003 Law on Public
