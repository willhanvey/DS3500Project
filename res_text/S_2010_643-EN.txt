  United States of America: draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions and statements by its President on the 
situation in Liberia and West Africa,  

 Welcoming the sustained progress made by the Government of Liberia since 
January 2006, in rebuilding Liberia for the benefit of all Liberians, with the support 
of the international community, 

 Recalling its decision not to renew the measures in paragraph 10 of resolution 
1521 (2003) regarding round log and timber products originating in Liberia, and 
stressing that Liberia’s progress in the timber sector must continue with the effective 
implementation and enforcement of the National Forestry Reform Law signed into 
law on 5 October 2006, and other new legislation related to revenue transparency 
(the Liberia Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative Act) and resolution of land 
and tenure rights (Community Rights Law with respect to Forest Lands and Lands 
Commission Act), 

 Recalling its decision to terminate the measures in paragraph 6 of resolution 
1521 (2003) regarding diamonds, and welcoming the Government of Liberia’s 
participation and leadership at the regional and international levels in the Kimberley 
Process, and encouraging the Government of Liberia to redouble its commitment 
and efforts to ensure the effectiveness of the Kimberley Process Certification 
Scheme, 

 Stressing the continuing importance of the United Nations Mission in Liberia 
(UNMIL) in improving security throughout Liberia and helping the Government 
establish its authority throughout the country, particularly in the diamond, timber, 
and other natural resources-producing regions, and border areas, 

 Taking note of the final report of the United Nations Panel of Experts on 
Liberia pursuant to paragraph 9 (f) of resolution 1903 (2009), including on the 
issues of diamonds, timber, targeted sanctions, and arms and security,  

 Having reviewed the measures imposed by paragraphs 2 and 4 of resolution 
1521 (2003) and paragraph 1 of resolution 1532 (2004) and the progress towards 
meeting the conditions set out by paragraph 5 of resolution 1521 (2003), and noting 
the Government of Liberia’s cooperation with UNMIL in weapons marking, and 
concluding that insufficient progress has been made towards that end, 



S/2010/643  
 

10-69995 2 
 

 Underlining its determination to support the Government of Liberia in its 
efforts to meet the conditions of resolution 1521 (2003), welcoming the engagement 
of the Peacebuilding Commission, and encouraging all stakeholders, including 
donors, to support the Government of Liberia in its efforts,  

 Acknowledging the implementation of the guidelines of the Department of 
Peacekeeping Operations on cooperation and information sharing between the 
United Nations peacekeeping missions and the Security Council’s Sanctions 
Committees’ expert panels, 

 Determining that, despite significant progress having been made in Liberia, the 
situation there continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security in 
the region, 

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 

 1. Decides to renew the measures on travel imposed by paragraph 4 of 
resolution 1521 (2003) for a period of 12 months from the date of adoption of this

 2. Recalls that the measures imposed by paragraph 1 of resolution 1532 
(2004) remain in force, notes with serious concern the lack of progress with regards 
to the implementation of the financial measures imposed by paragraph 1 of 
resolution 1532 (2004), and demands that the Government of Liberia make all 
necessary efforts to fulfil its obligations; 

 3. Decides to renew for a period of 12 months from the date of adoption of 
this resolution the measures on arms, previously imposed by paragraph 2 of

(2006), by paragraph 1 (b) of resolution 1731 (2006), and by paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and

 5. Decides to review any of the above measures at the request of the

met, and provides the Council with information to justify its assessment;

Committee of the individuals described in paragraph 4 (a) of resolution 1521 (2003)

 (d) Within the context of Liberia’s evolving legal framework, assess the

with the Panel of Experts in all the aspects of its mandate;

with the relevant governmental authorities in accordance with the Economic 
Community Of West African States Convention on Small Arms and Light Weapons 
of 2006; 

 10. Reiterates the importance of UNMIL’s continuing assistance to the
