and United States of America: draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council,  

 Reaffirming that terrorism in all forms and manifestations constitutes one of 
the most serious threats to international peace and security and that any acts of 
terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivations, whenever 
and by whomsoever committed and further reaffirming the need to combat by all 
means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, threats to international 
peace and security caused by terrorist acts,  

 Recalling all its relevant resolutions and Presidential Statements concerning 
threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts, 

 Reiterating the obligation of Member States to prevent and suppress the 
financing of terrorist acts,  

 Recalling relevant international counter-terrorism instruments, including the 
International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and the 
International Convention against the Taking of Hostages, 

 Strongly condemning incidents of kidnapping and hostage-taking committed by 
terrorist groups for any purpose, including raising funds or gaining political 
concessions,  

 Expressing concern at the increase in incidents of kidnapping and hostage-
taking committed by terrorist groups with the aim of raising funds, or gaining 
political concessions, in particular the increase in kidnappings by Al-Qaida and its 
affiliated groups, and underscoring that the payment of ransoms to terrorists funds 
future kidnappings and hostage-takings which creates more victims and perpetuates 
the problem, 

 Expressing its determination to prevent kidnapping and hostage-taking 
committed by terrorist groups and to secure the safe release of hostages without 
ransom payments or political concessions, in accordance with applicable 
international law and, in this regard, noting the work of the Global Counterterrorism 
Forum (GCTF), in particular its publication of several framework documents and 
good practices, including in the area of kidnapping for ransom, to complement the 
work of the relevant United Nations counter-terrorism entities,  



S/2014/38  
 

14-21799 2/3 
 

 Recognizing the need to further strengthen efforts to support victims and those 
affected by incidents of kidnapping for ransom and hostage-taking committed by 
terrorist groups and to give careful consideration to protecting the lives of hostages 
and those kidnapped, and reaffirming that States must ensure that any measures 
taken to counter terrorism comply with their obligations under international law, in 
particular international human rights law, refugee law, and international 
humanitarian law, as appropriate, 

 Noting the decision of the Group of Eight Summit in Lough Erne to address 
the threat posed by kidnapping for ransom by terrorists and the preventive steps the 
international community can take in this regard and to encourage further expert 
discussion, including at the Roma Lyon group, to deepen understanding of this 
problem, and further noting that paragraph 225.6 of the Final Document of the 
16th Summit of the Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Movement 
condemned criminal incidences of hostage-taking with resultant demands for 
ransoms and/or other political concessions by terrorist groups, 

 Expressing its commitment to support efforts to reduce terrorist groups’ access 
to funding and financial services through the ongoing work of UN counter-terrorism 
bodies and the Financial Action Task Force to improve anti-money laundering and 
terrorist financing frameworks worldwide, 

 Expressing concern at the increased use, in a globalized society, by terrorists 
and their supporters of new information and communication technologies, in 
particular the Internet, for the purposes of recruitment and incitement to commit 
terrorist acts, as well as for the financing, planning and preparation of their 
activities,  

 Recalling its resolutions 1904 (2009), 1989 (2011) and 2083 (2012), which, 
inter alia, confirm that the requirements of operative paragraph 1(a) of these 
resolutions, also apply to the payment of ransoms to individuals, groups, 
undertakings or entities on the Al-Qaida sanctions list, 

 Reaffirming that acts, methods, and practices of terrorism are contrary to the 
purposes and principles of the United Nations and that knowingly financing, 
planning and inciting terrorist acts are also contrary to the purposes and principles 
of the United Nations,  

 1. Reaffirms its resolution 1373 (2001) and in particular its decisions that 
all States shall prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts and refrain from 
providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities or persons involved in 
terrorist acts, including by suppressing recruitment of members of terrorist groups 
and eliminating the supply of weapons to terrorists;  

 2. Further reaffirms its decision in resolution 1373 (2001) that all States 
shall prohibit their nationals or any persons and entities within their territories from 
making any funds, financial assets or economic resources or financial or other 
related services available, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of persons who 
commit or attempt to commit or facilitate or participate in the commission of 
terrorist acts, of entities owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by such persons 
and of persons and entities acting on behalf of or at the direction of such persons;

 3. Calls upon all Member States to prevent terrorists from benefiting 
directly or indirectly from ransom payments or from political concessions and to 
secure the safe release of hostages;

kidnapping and hostage-taking committed by terrorist groups;

afford one another the greatest measure of assistance in connection with criminal 
investigations or criminal proceedings relating to the financing or support of

 6. Recognizes the need to continue expert discussions on kidnapping for 
ransom by terrorists, and calls upon Member States to continue such expert 
discussions within the United Nations and other relevant international and regional 
organizations, including the GCTF, on additional steps the international community 
could take to prevent kidnappings and to prevent terrorists from benefiting directly 
or indirectly from using kidnapping to raise funds or gain political concessions;  

 7. Notes that ransom payments to terrorist groups are one of the sources of 
income which supports their recruitment efforts, strengthens their operational 
capability to organize and carry out terrorist attacks, and incentivizes future 
incidents of kidnapping for ransom; 

 8. Encourages the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) established 
pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001) to hold, with the assistance of appropriate 
expertise, a Special Meeting with the participation of Member States and relevant 
international and regional organizations to discuss measures to prevent incidents of 
kidnapping and hostage-taking committed by terrorist groups to raise funds or gain 
political concessions, and requests the CTC to report to the Council on the outcomes 
of this Meeting; 

 9. Recalls the adoption by the GCTF of the “Algiers Memorandum on Good 
Practices on Preventing and Denying the Benefits of Kidnapping for Ransom by 
Terrorists” and encourages CTED to take it into account, as appropriate, consistent 
with its mandate, including in its facilitation of capacity building to Member States;  

 10. Calls upon all Member States to encourage private sector partners to 
adopt or to follow relevant guidelines and good practices for preventing and 
responding to terrorist kidnappings without paying ransoms;

Committee and the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011) and 
other relevant UN counter-terrorism bodies to cooperate closely when providing 
information on the measures taken by Member States on this issue and on relevant 
trends and developments in this area;  

 13. Decides to remain seized of this matter.
