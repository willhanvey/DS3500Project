 Recognizing that poverty is an affront to human dignity,  

 Recognizing also that extreme poverty and hunger are the greatest global threat 
that requires the collective commitment of the international community for its 
eradication, pursuant to Millennium Development Goal 1, and therefore calling 
upon the international community, including the Human Rights Council, to 
contribute towards achieving that goal,  

 Recognizing further that historical injustices have undeniably contributed to 
the poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion, economic 
disparity, instability and insecurity that affect many people in different parts of the 
world, in particular in developing countries,  

 Stressing that poverty eradication is one of the critical elements in the 
promotion and realization of the right to development and that poverty is a 
multifaceted problem that requires a multifaceted and integrated approach in 
addressing economic, political, social, environmental and institutional dimensions at 
all levels, especially in the context of the Millennium Development Goal of halving, 
by 2015, the proportion of the world’s people whose income is less than one dollar a 
day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger,  

 1. Endorses the conclusions and recommendations adopted by consensus by 
the Working Group on the Right to Development of the Human Rights Council at its 
ninth session,8 and calls for their immediate, full and effective implementation by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and other 
relevant actors;  

 2. Supports the realization of the mandate of the Working Group as renewed 
by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 9/3,6 with the recognition that the 
Working Group will convene annual sessions of five working days and present its 
reports to the Council; 

 3. Also supports the realization of the mandate of the high-level task force 
on the implementation of the right to development, established within the 
framework of the Working Group, as renewed by the Human Rights Council in its 
resolution 9/3, with the further recognition that the task force will convene annual 
sessions of seven working days and present its reports to the Working Group; 

 4. Emphasizes the relevant provisions of General Assembly resolution 
60/251 of 15 March 2006 establishing the Human Rights Council, and in this regard 
calls upon the Council to implement the agreement to continue to act to ensure that 
its agenda promotes and advances sustainable development and the achievements of 
the Millennium Development Goals, and also in this regard, to lead to raising the 
right to development, as set out in paragraphs 5 and 10 of the Vienna Declaration 
and Programme of Action,3 to the same level and on a par with all other human 
rights and fundamental freedoms;  

 5. Notes with appreciation that the high-level task force, at its second 
meeting, examined Millennium Development Goal 8, on developing a global 
partnership for development, and suggested criteria for its periodic evaluation with 
the aim of improving the effectiveness of global partnership with regard to the 
realization of the right to development;11

 6. Stresses the importance of endorsement of the workplan for the task force 
for the period 2008-2010, outlined in paragraph 43 of the report of the Working 
Group,8 which requires that the criteria for the periodic evaluation of global 
partnerships, as identified in Millennium Development Goal 8, to be submitted by 
the task force to the Working Group at its eleventh session in 2010, is extended to 
other components of Millennium Development Goal 8; 

 7. Also stresses that the above criteria, once considered, revised and 
endorsed by the Working Group, should be used, as appropriate, in the elaboration 
of a comprehensive and coherent set of standards for the implementation of the right 
to development;  

 8. Emphasizes the importance that, upon completion of the three phases of 
the road map, the Working Group take appropriate steps to ensure respect for and 
practical application of these standards, which could take various forms, including 
guidelines on the implementation of the right to development, and evolve into a 
basis for consideration of an international legal standard of a binding nature, 
through a collaborative process of engagement; 

 9. Stresses the importance of the core principles contained in the 
conclusions of the Working Group at its third session,12 congruent with the purpose 
of international human rights instruments, such as equality, non-discrimination, 
accountability, participation and international cooperation, as critical to 
mainstreaming the right to development at the national and international levels, and 
underlines the importance of the principles of equity and transparency;  

 10. Also stresses that it is important that the high-level task force and the 
Working Group, in the discharge of their mandates, take into account the need:  

 (a) To promote the democratization of the system of international 
governance in order to increase the effective participation of developing countries in 
international decision-making; 

 (b) To also promote effective partnerships such as the New Partnership for 
Africa’s Development10 and other similar initiatives with the developing countries, 
particularly the least developed countries, for the purpose of the realization of their 
right to development, including the achievement of the Millennium Development 
Goals;  

 (c) To strive for greater acceptance, operationalization and realization of the 
right to development at the international level, while urging all States to undertake 
at the national level the necessary policy formulation and to institute the measures 
required for the implementation of the right to development as an integral part of 
fundamental human rights, and also urging all States to expand and deepen mutually 
beneficial cooperation in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to 
development in the context of promoting effective international cooperation for the 
realization of the right to development, bearing in mind that lasting progress 
towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective 
development policies at the national level and a favourable economic environment 
at the international level;

 (d) To consider ways and means to continue to ensure the operationalization 
of the right to development as a priority;  

 (e) To mainstream the right to development in the policies and operational 
activities of the United Nations and the specialized agencies, programmes and 
funds, as well as in policies and strategies of the international financial and 
multilateral trading systems, taking into account in this regard that the core 
principles of the international economic, commercial and financial spheres, such as 
equity, non-discrimination, transparency, accountability, participation and 
international cooperation, including effective partnerships for development, are 
indispensable in achieving the right to development and preventing discriminatory 
treatment arising out of political or other non-economic considerations, in 
addressing the issues of concern to the developing countries;  

 11. Encourages the Human Rights Council to consider how to ensure follow-
up to the ongoing work of the former Subcommission on the Promotion and 
Protection of Human Rights on the right to development, in accordance with the 
relevant provisions of General Assembly and Commission on Human Rights 
resolutions, and in compliance with decisions to be taken by the Human Rights 
Council; 

 12. Invites Member States and all other stakeholders to participate actively in 
future sessions of the Social Forum, while recognizing the strong support extended 
to the Forum at its previous four sessions by the Subcommission on the Promotion 
and Protection of Human Rights;  

 13. Reaffirms the commitment to implement the goals and targets set out in 
all the outcome documents of the major United Nations conferences and summits 
and their review processes, in particular those relating to the realization of the right 
to development, recognizing that the realization of the right to development is 
critical to achieving the objectives, goals and targets set in those outcome 
documents;  

 14. Also reaffirms that the realization of the right to development is essential 
to the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which 
regards all human rights as universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, 
places the human person at the centre of development and recognizes that, while 
development facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights, the lack of development 
may not be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally recognized human 
rights;  

 15. Stresses that the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection 
of all human rights lies with the State, and reaffirms that States have the primary 
responsibility for their own economic and social development and that the role of 
national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized;  

 16. Reaffirms the primary responsibility of States to create national and 
international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to development, as 
well as their commitment to cooperate with each other to that end;  

 17. Also reaffirms the need for an international environment that is 
conducive to the realization of the right to development;  

 18. Stresses the need to strive for greater acceptance, operationalization and 
realization of the right to development at the international and national levels, and 



A/C.3/63/L.30/Rev.1  
 

08-60649 6 
 

calls upon States to institute the measures required for the implementation of the 
right to development as an integral part of fundamental human rights;  

 19. Emphasizes the critical importance of identifying and analysing obstacles 
impeding the full realization of the right to development at both the national and the 
international levels;  

 20. Affirms that, while globalization offers both opportunities and challenges, 
the process of globalization remains deficient in achieving the objectives of 
integrating all countries into a globalized world, and stresses the need for policies 
and measures at the national and global levels to respond to the challenges and 
opportunities of globalization if this process is to be made fully inclusive and 
equitable;  

 21. Recognizes that, despite continuous efforts on the part of the 
international community, the gap between developed and developing countries 
remains unacceptably wide, that most of the developing countries continue to face 
difficulties in participating in the globalization process and that many risk being 
marginalized and effectively excluded from its benefits;  

 22. Expresses its deep concern in this regard at the negative impact on the 
realization of the right to development owing to the further aggravation of the 
economic and social situation, in particular of developing countries, as the result of 
the ongoing international energy, food and financial crises; 

 23. Underlines the fact that the international community is far from meeting 
the target set in the United Nations Millennium Declaration4 of halving the number 
of people living in poverty by 2015, reaffirms the commitment made to meet that 
target, and emphasizes the principle of international cooperation, including 
partnership and commitment, between developed and developing countries towards 
achieving the goal;  

 24. Urges developed countries that have not yet done so to make concrete 
efforts towards meeting the targets of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for 
official development assistance to developing countries and 0.15 to 0.2 per cent of 
their gross national product to least developed countries, and encourages developing 
countries to build on the progress achieved in ensuring that official development 
assistance is used effectively to help to meet development goals and targets;  

 25. Recognizes the need to address market access for developing countries, 
including in agriculture, services and non-agricultural products, in particular those 
of interest to developing countries;  

 26. Calls for the implementation of a desirable pace of meaningful trade 
liberalization, including in areas under negotiation in the World Trade Organization; 
implementation of commitments on implementation-related issues and concerns; 
review of special and differential treatment provisions, with a view to strengthening 
them and making them more precise, effective and operational; avoidance of new 
forms of protectionism; and capacity-building and technical assistance for 
developing countries as important issues in making progress towards the effective 
implementation of the right to development;  

 27. Recognizes the important link between the international economic, 
commercial and financial spheres and the realization of the right to development, 
stresses, in this regard, the need for good governance and broadening the base of 



 A/C.3/63/L.30/Rev.1
 

7 08-60649 
 

decision-making at the international level on issues of development concern and the 
need to fill organizational gaps, as well as strengthen the United Nations system and 
other multilateral institutions, and also stresses the need to broaden and strengthen 
the participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition 
in international economic decision-making and norm-setting;  

 28. Also recognizes that good governance and the rule of law at the national 
level assist all States in the promotion and protection of human rights, including the 
right to development, and agrees on the value of the ongoing efforts being made by 
States to identify and strengthen good governance practices, including transparent, 
responsible, accountable and participatory government, that are responsive and 
appropriate to their needs and aspirations, including in the context of agreed 
partnership approaches to development, capacity-building and technical assistance;  

 29. Further recognizes the important role and the rights of women and the 
application of a gender perspective as a cross-cutting issue in the process of 
realizing the right to development, and notes in particular the positive relationship 
between women’s education and their equal participation in the civil, cultural, 
economic, political and social activities of the community and the promotion of the 
right to development;  

 30. Stresses the need for the integration of the rights of children, girls and 
boys alike, in all policies and programmes, and for ensuring the promotion and 
protection of those rights, especially in areas relating to health, education and the 
full development of their capacities;  

 31. Welcomes the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS adopted at the High-
level Meeting of the General Assembly on 2 June 2006,13 stresses that further and 
additional measures must be taken at the national and international levels to fight 
HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases, taking into account ongoing efforts 
and programmes, and reiterates the need for international assistance in this regard;

Persons with Disabilities14 on 3 May 2008;

realization of the right to development, and reaffirms the commitment to promote 
their rights in the areas of education, employment, vocational training and 
retraining, housing, sanitation, health and social security in accordance with 
recognized international human rights obligations and taking into account, as 
appropriate, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 61/295 of 13 September 2007;

organizations and the private sector in pursuit of poverty eradication and 
development, as well as for corporate social responsibility;

detect and deter in a more effective manner international transfers of illicitly 
acquired assets and to strengthen international cooperation in asset recovery

consistent with the principles of the United Nations Convention against

political commitment on the part of all Governments through a firm legal 
framework, and in this context urges States to sign and ratify as soon as possible,

Secretary-General to provide the Office of the High Commissioner with the 
necessary resources;  

 37. Reaffirms the request to the High Commissioner, in mainstreaming the
