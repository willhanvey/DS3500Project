 The General Assembly,  

 Recalling the relevant principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations,  

 Reaffirming the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning 

Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of 

the United Nations,
1
 which states, inter alia, that no State may use or encourage the 

use of unilateral economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another 

State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign 

rights, 

 Bearing in mind the general principles governing the international trading 

system and trade policies for development contained in relevant resolutions, rules 

and provisions of the United Nations and the World Trade Organization,  

 Recalling its resolutions 44/215 of 22 December 1989, 46/210 of 20 December 

1991, 48/168 of 21 December 1993, 50/96 of 20 December 1995, 52/181 of

 Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures

in particular and has a general negative impact on international economic 

cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and 

open multilateral trading system,

 Recognizing that such measures constitute a flagrant violation of the principles 

of international law as set forth in the Charter, as well as the basic principles of the 

multilateral trading system, 

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;
2
 

 2. Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective 

measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against 

developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United 

Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the 

Charter of the United Nations and that contravene the basic principles of the 

multilateral trading system;  

 3. Calls upon the international community to condemn and reject the 

imposition of the use of such measures as a means of political and economic 

coercion against developing countries;  

 4. Requests the Secretary-General to monitor the imposition of unilateral 

economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion and to study the 

impact of such measures on the affected countries, including the impact on trade 

and development; 

 5. Also requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at 

its seventy-fourth session a report on the implementation of the present resolution.
