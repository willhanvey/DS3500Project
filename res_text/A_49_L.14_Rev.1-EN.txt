that these practices, as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur on

10. Urges the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,
as part of its humanitarian assistance programme, to provide appropriate

that their activities aimed to achieve integration of the occupied territories

International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious
Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the
Former Yugoslavia since 1991 have been removed and looks forward to a speedy

context encourages the provision of all resources necessary, including full
funding as well as voluntary contributions from States and intergovernmental and
non-governmental organizations, in accordance with the above-stated principle of
non-interference, so that the Tribunal can conduct without any further delay its
stipulated functions of trying and punishing those responsible for the
perpetration of violations of international law;
