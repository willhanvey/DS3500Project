  United States of America: draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions and statements of its President concerning 
Sudan,  

 Reaffirming its commitment to the cause of peace throughout Sudan, to the 
sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Sudan, to the full and 
timely implementation of resolution 1591 (2005) and recalling the importance of the 
principles of good neighbourliness, non-interference and cooperation in the relations 
among States in the region,  

 Reiterating the need for an end to the violence and continued abuses in Darfur 
and recognizing that the Darfur conflict cannot be resolved militarily and a durable 
solution can only be obtained through an inclusive political process, and, in this 
regard, noting the importance of implementing the Doha Document for Peace in 
Darfur (DDPD), 

 Acknowledging efforts made by the Government of Sudan and all parties to the 
conflict to reach a comprehensive and inclusive solution to the conflict, and in this 
context, condemning the killing of Mohammed Bashar and other members of his 
movement by JEM-Gibril forces, as well as any act of violence aimed to act as a 
disincentive to peace efforts in Darfur,  

 Urging the Government of Sudan, the Liberation and Justice Movement (LJM) 
and Justice and Equality Movement-Mohamed Bashar (JEM-Bashar) to deliver on 
the commitments made in the DDPD, and urging all parties, in particular other 
armed movements who have not signed the DDPD, to engage immediately and 
without preconditions and to make every effort to reach a comprehensive peace 
settlement on the basis of the DDPD, and to agree upon a permanent ceasefire 
without further delay, 

 Emphasizing the imperative for all armed actors to refrain from all acts of 
violence against civilians, in particular vulnerable groups such as women and 
children, and from violations and abuses of human rights and violations of 
international humanitarian law, and the need to address the urgent humanitarian 
crisis faced by the people of Darfur, including the guarantee of safe, timely and 
unhindered humanitarian access to all areas by humanitarian agencies and 
personnel, while respecting the United Nations guiding principles of humanitarian 
assistance and the relevant provisions of International Humanitarian Law,

non-signatory armed groups in Darfur and groups outside Darfur, and demanding 
that direct or indirect military support for such armed groups in Darfur ceases, and 
condemning actions by any armed group aimed at forced overthrow of the 
Government of Sudan, noting there is no military solution to the conflict in Sudan,  

 Expressing deep concern at the increased violence and insecurity in some parts 
of Darfur in recent months, including notably the escalation in inter-tribal fighting, 
expressing deep concern that such clashes continue to restrict humanitarian access 
to conflict areas where vulnerable civilian populations reside, acknowledging the 
efforts of Sudanese authorities to mediate in inter-tribal fighting,  

 Demanding that the parties to the conflict exercise restraint and cease military 
action of all kind, including aerial bombardments,  

 Demanding an immediate and complete cessation by all parties to the armed 
conflict of all acts of sexual violence against civilians in line with resolutions 1325 
(2000), 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009), and 1889 (2009), 1960 (2010), 2106 (2013), 2122

1296 (2000), 1674 (2006), 1738, (2006), 1894 (2009), 

 Commending the efforts of, and reiterating its full support for, the United 
Nations/African Union Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID), the Joint African 
Union/United Nations Mediation, the United Nations Secretary-General, the African 
Union High Level Implementation Panel on Sudan, and the leaders of the region to 
promote peace and stability in Darfur, and expressing strong support for the political 
process under the African Union/United Nations-led mediation, 

 Reiterating its strong condemnation of attacks against UNAMID and its call 
on the Government of Sudan to swiftly investigate these attacks and bring the 
perpetrators to justice, and further reiterating its call on all parties in Darfur to 
cooperate fully with the mission, and reaffirms its deep condolences to the 
Governments and families of those killed, 

 Reaffirming its concern over the negative effect of ongoing violence in Darfur 
on the stability of Sudan as a whole, as well as the region, welcoming the ongoing 
good relations between Sudan and Chad, and encouraging Sudan, Chad and the 
Central African Republic to continue to cooperate in order to achieve peace and 
stability in Darfur and the wider region,  

 Expressing concern at the risks to peace and security arising from the illicit 
transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons, 

 Deploring the continued obstacles that have been imposed by the Government 
of Sudan on the work of the Panel of Experts during the course of its mandate, 
including restrictions to the freedom of movement of the Panel of Experts and 
UNAMID, and limitations on the Panel of Experts’ access to areas of armed conflict 
and areas of reported violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, 
while noting improved interaction between the Government of Sudan and the Panel 
of Experts,

 Further deploring incidents of interference by the Government of Sudan with 
the work of the Panel of Experts, including the denial of entry of the Panel’s 
Finance Expert, as set out in paragraphs 2, 18, and 21 of the Final Report of the 
Panel of Experts (S/2014/87),  

 Welcoming the enhanced cooperation and information sharing between 
UNAMID and the Panel of Experts, called for by the Department of Peacekeeping 
Operations’ guidelines and with the assistance of the UNAMID focal point, 

 Welcoming the efforts made by the Secretariat to expand and improve the 
roster of experts for the Security Council Subsidiary Organs Branch, bearing in 
mind the guidance provided by the Note of the President S/2006/997, 

 Recalling the 22 January 2014 report (S/2014/87) by the Panel of Experts 
appointed by the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 3 (b) of resolution 1591 
(2005) and extended by subsequent resolutions, and expressing its intent to further 
study, through the Committee, the Panel’s recommendations and to consider 
appropriate next steps, 

 Emphasizing the need to respect the provisions of the Charter concerning 
privileges and immunities, and the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of 
the United Nations, as applicable to United Nations operations and persons engaged 
in such operations, 

 Reminding all States, particularly States in the region, of the obligations 
contained in resolutions 1556 (2004), 1591 (2005), and 1945 (2010) in particular 
those obligations relating to arms and related materiel, 

 Calling on the Government of Sudan to fulfil all its commitments, including 
lifting the state of emergency in Darfur, allowing free expression and undertaking 
effective efforts to ensure accountability for violations and abuses of human rights 
and violations of international humanitarian law, by whomsoever perpetrated, 

 Noting that acts of hostility, violence or intimidation against the civilian 
population, including IDPs, in Darfur and other activities that could endanger or 
undermine the Parties’ commitment to a complete and durable cessation of 
hostilities would be inconsistent with the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur, 

 Determining that the situation in Sudan continues to constitute a threat to 
international peace and security in the region, 

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 

 1. Decides to extend the mandate of the Panel of Experts, originally

surplus, seized, unmarked, or illicitly held weapons and ammunition;

effectively to such violations;

  Cooperation  
 

 16. Calls on the Government of Sudan to remove all restrictions, limitations 
and bureaucratic impediments imposed on the work of the Panel of Experts, 
including by issuing timely multiple-entry visas to all members of the Panel of
