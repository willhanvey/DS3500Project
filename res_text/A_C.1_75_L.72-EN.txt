General and complete disarmament  
 

 

 

Chile, Ecuador, Malawi, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Republic of Moldova, 

Sweden and Switzerland: draft resolution  
 

 

Decreasing the operational readiness of nuclear weapons systems  
 

 

 The General Assembly,  

 Recalling its resolutions 62/36 of 5 December 2007, 63/41 of 2 December 2008, 

65/71 of 8 December 2010, 67/46 of 3 December 2012, 69/42 of 2 December 2014, 

71/53 of 5 December 2016 and 73/60 of 5 December 2018, 

 Recalling also that the maintenance of nuclear weapons on high alert was a 

feature of cold war nuclear postures, and welcoming the increased confidence and 

transparency since the cessation of the cold war, while noting with concern the recent 

deterioration in the international security climate, 

 Concerned that several thousand nuclear weapons remain on high alert, ready 

to be launched within minutes, 

 Noting the continuing engagement in multilateral disarmament forums in 

support of further reductions to the operational status of nuclear weapons systems,  

 Recognizing that the maintenance of nuclear weapons systems at a high level of 

readiness increases the risk of the unintentional or accidental use of such weapons, 

which would have catastrophic humanitarian consequences,  

 Recognizing also that reductions in deployments and the lowering of operational 

status contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security, as well as to 

the process of nuclear disarmament, through the enhancement of confidence-building 

and transparency measures and a diminishing role for nuclear weapons in security 

policies, 

 Welcoming the steps taken by some States in support of nuclear disarmament, 

including de-targeting initiatives, increasing the amount of preparation time required 

for deployment and other measures to diminish further the possibility of nuclear 

launches resulting from accidents, unauthorized actions or misperceptions,  

 Recalling the adoption by consensus of the conclusions and recommendations 

for follow-on actions by the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on

20-13691 2/2 

 

the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,1 including the commitments of the 

nuclear-weapon States to promptly engage with a view to, inter alia, considering the 

legitimate interest of non-nuclear-weapon States in further reducing the operational 

status of nuclear weapons systems in ways that promote international stability and 

security, 

 Encouraging, in this regard, continued dialogue among the nuclear-weapon 

States to advance their nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament commitments 

under the action plan of the 2010 Review Conference, 2 and acknowledging the 

potential of this process for leading to deeper engagement on nuclear disarmament 

and greater mutual confidence, 

 Taking note of the references to operational readiness in reports of the nuclear-

weapon States during the last and current review cycles of the Treaty on the 

Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and looking forward to further information 

on this matter being provided in national reports to the tenth Review Conference of 

the Parties to the Treaty, 

 Welcoming all opportunities to address the further reduction of the operational 

status of nuclear weapons systems as a step leading to nuclear disarmament,  

 1. Calls for practical and concrete steps to be taken, unilaterally, bilaterally 

or multilaterally, to decrease the operational readiness of nuclear weapons systems, 

with a view to ensuring that all nuclear weapons are removed from high alert status;  

 2. Looks forward to the issue of the lowering of the operational readiness of 

nuclear weapons systems being addressed further at the tenth Review Conference of 

the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; 

 3. Urges States to update the General Assembly on progress made in the 

implementation of the present resolution;  

 4. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
