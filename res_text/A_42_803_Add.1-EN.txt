Recalling, in particular, Commission on Human Rights resolution 1981/55
of 11 March 1981, by which it decided to extend the mandate of its special
Representative for one year and requested him to present an interim report to

in the Islamic ~epublic of Iran, including the situation of minority gtoupa
such a~ the Baha'is and on new elements contained in his report, for exum~)le,
the allegations of violations affecting the medical profession, an~ B final
report to the Commission at its forty-fourth session,

Taking note of the opinion of the special Representative that legal
obligations and commitments on human rights do not foresee or admit of partial
acceptance of instruments that have been conceived, drafted and adopted QO a
unified, coherent and complete set of norms,
,

Notin~ the Special Representative's conviction that the persons appearing
before him described violations that certainly happened to them and that their
declarations were convincing,

Taking note of the Special Representative's view that the partial
co-operation he received in 1986 from the Government of the Islamic Republic
of Iran had gone further, both through documents and personal uontactu and
that, therefore, there are grounds to hope that it may still increose in the
months preceding the presentation of the final report,

Concerned none the less at the Special Representative's ronclusion that
the co-operation extended to him has not Keached the level that the General
Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights have consistently requested in the
resolutions concernir.g this matter,

1. Takes note with appreciati,n of the interim report of the Special
Representative and the considerations and the observations contained
therein, W

2. Notes that the Special Representative observes that the problom
concerning the medical profession appears to have been solved;

3. Welcomes the pardoning of prisoners and shares the Special
Representative's hope that this may be the first stage of a prOCODG leading to
a general amnesty for political prisoner~,

4. Expresses again its deep concern about the numerous and detailed
allegations of grave human rights violations in the Islamic Republic of Iran
to which the special Representative has referred in his report ~nd, 1n
particular, those related to the right to life, the right to freedom from
torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the right to
liberty and security of person and to freedom from arbitrary arrest or
detention, the right to a fair trial, the right to freedom of thought,
conscience and religion and to freedom of expression, and the right of
religious minorities to profess and practise their own religion,

s. Expresses its grave concern in particular that, although the Special
Representative indicates that the number of alleged violations to the right to
life has diminished over the past two years, information made available to him
alleges the execution of some one hundred persons in the period
October 1986-September 1987 because of their political and religious
convictions;

6. Expresses its deep concern at allegations that maltreatment and
torture, both physical and psychological, are common in Iranian prisons during
interrogation and before and after the final verdict, and at the existence of
extremely summary and informal proceedings, the unawareness of specific
accusations, the lack of legal counsel and other irregul~ities in respect to
fair tri.al;

7. Shares the opinion of the Special Representative that the denial by
the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran of the allegations of
violations of human rights as a whole, without details, is not sufficient for
a sensible assessment of the situation on human rights in that country;

8. Endorses the conclusion of the Special Representative that acts
continue to occur in the Islamic Republic of Iran that are inconsistent with
international instruments to which the Government of that country is bound,
and that the persistence of certain facts continues to justify continuing
international concern;

9. Urges the Government of the Islamic Republc of Iran as a state party
to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, !!I to respect
and ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its
jurisdiction the rights recognized in that Covenant;

Situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Chile

The General Assembly,

~ of its responsibility to promote and encourage respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms and determined to remain vigilant with regard
to violations of human rights wherever they occur,

Noting the obligation of the Government of Chile to respect and protect
human rights in accordance with the international instruments to which Chile
is a party,

Beari29 in mind that the concern of the international community at the
situation of human rights in Chile was expressed by the General Assembly in a
number of resolutions, particularly resolution 33/173 of 20 December 1978 on
disappeared persons and tesolution 41/161 of 4 December 1986 in which the
General Assembly invited the Commission on HUJIlan Rights to adopt the most
appropriate measures for the effective restoration of human rights and
fundamental freedoms in that country, including the extension of the mandate
of the SPecial Rapporteur,

Considering that the Special Rapporteur proposes to submit to the
Commission on Human Rights at its forty-fourth session a fin~l report on the
situation of human rights in Chile,

Recalling the pertinent resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights,
particUlarly resolution 1987/60 of 12 March 1987, 96/ in which the Commission
decided, inter alia, to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for one
year and to consider that subject, as a matter of high priority, in view of
the persistence of serious violations of human rights in Chile,

Deploring once again the fact that the repeated appeals of the General
Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and other international organs to
re-establish human rights and fundamental freedoms have been ignored by the
Chilean authorities,

Considering the reports prepared by various non-governmental
organizations which have made pUblic the serious violations of human rights in
Chile,

Observing that the maintenanoe of stattls of emergenoy oonstitutes a
source of frequent violations of human rights and gives rise to the arbitrary
intervention of the pUblio authorities in the free exeroise of democratio
aotivities,

Noting that, although opposition publications ha"o in some oases been
authorized, these are frequontly subjected to arbitrary restriotions and
limitations, inclUding the detention and proseoution of their editors,

Regretting that measures taken by the Government of Chil~, suoh ae
signing international instruments against torture and authorizing the
International Committee of the Red Cross to visit plaoes of detention in some
cases, have not put an end to the practice of torture and arbitrary detention,

Notin3 that, in the absence of an institutional framework tor holding
free eleotions, the adoption of laws on political parties and electoral
registration do not constitute an expression of the people's sovereignty or
meet the basic requirem9nts of a democratio rule of law nor comply with the
principle of non-discrimination on grounds of political or other opinions

the Special Rapporteur to visit the country again in March 1987, providing him
with its continuing co-operation and free 6CCeGS to the facilities for
conducting his investigation and ~xpresses its confidence that a further visit
will be authorized on the same conditions in the immediate future. At the
same time, it regrets that this co-operation of the Government of Chile with
the efforts of the United Nations has not led to a subotantial improvement in
human rights and fundamental freedoms,

3. Expresses its deep distress at the absence of a legal and political
structure that protects the unrestricted exercise of human rights and
fundamental freedoms, a basic aondition for the free expression of the
people's sovereignty;

4. Again expressea its conviction that a legal and ~~~itical order
baeed on the expression of the people's will through an electoral process
open, on an equal footing, to all citizens and on free elections ia
fundamental to the full respect for human right~ in Chile aa it is in any

marginal settlements and university premises and acts of intimidation against

8. Exeresses its grave concern at the ineffeotiveness of the government
authorities in preventing the ill-treatment of indiViduals by the military,
