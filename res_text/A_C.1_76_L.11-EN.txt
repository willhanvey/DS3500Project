Humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 70/47 of 7 December 2015, 71/46 of 5 December 2016, 

72/30 of 4 December 2017, 73/47 of 5 December 2018, 74/42 of 12 December 2019 

and 75/39 of 7 December 2020, 

 Reiterating the deep concern about the catastrophic consequences of nuclear 

weapons, 

 Stressing that the immense and uncontrollable destructive capability and 

indiscriminate nature of nuclear weapons cause unacceptable humanitarian 

consequences, as has been demonstrated through their past use and testing,  

 Recalling that concern about the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons 

has been reflected in numerous United Nations resolutions, including the first 

resolution adopted by the General Assembly, on 24 January 1946,  

 Recalling also that at the first special session of the General Assembly devoted 

to disarmament, in 1978, the Assembly stressed that nuclear weapons posed the 

greatest danger to mankind and to the survival of civilization, 1

 Welcoming the renewed interest and resolve of the international community, together 

with the International Committee of the Red Cross and international humanitarian 

organizations, to address the catastrophic consequences of nuclear weapons, 

 Recalling that the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the 

Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons expressed deep concern at the catastrophic 

humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons, 2 

 Noting the resolution of 26 November 2011 of the Council of Delegates of the 

International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement entitled “Working towards the 

elimination of nuclear weapons”,  

 Recalling the joint statements on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear 

weapons delivered to the General Assembly and during the 2010–2015 cycle of the 

review of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,3 

 Welcoming the facts-based discussions on the effects of a nuclear weapon 

detonation that were held at the conferences on the humanitarian impact of nuclear 

weapons, convened by Norway, on 4 and 5 March 2013, Mexico, on 13 and 

14 February 2014, and Austria, on 8 and 9 December 2014,  

 Cognizant that a key message from experts and international organizations at 

those conferences was that no State or international body could address the immediate 

humanitarian emergency caused by a nuclear weapon detonation or provide adequate 

assistance to victims, 

 Firmly believing that it is in the interest of all States to engage in discussions on 

the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons with the aim of further broadening 

and deepening the understanding of this matter, and welcoming civil society’s 

ongoing engagement, 

 Reaffirming the role of civil society, in partnership with Governments, in raising 

awareness about the unacceptable humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons,  

 Emphasizing that the catastrophic consequences of nuclear weapons affect not 

only Governments but each and every citizen of our interconnected world and have 

deep implications for human survival, for the environment, for socioeconomic 

development, for our economies and for the health of future generations,  

 1. Stresses that it is in the interest of the very survival of humanity that 

nuclear weapons never be used again, under any circumstances;  

 2. Emphasizes that the only way to guarantee that nuclear weapons will never 

be used again is their total elimination;  

 3. Stresses that the catastrophic effects of a nuclear weapon detonation, 

whether by accident, miscalculation or design, cannot be adequately  addressed; 

 4. Expresses its firm belief that awareness of the catastrophic consequences 

of nuclear weapons must underpin all approaches and efforts towards nuclear 

disarmament; 

 5. Calls upon all States, in their shared responsibility, to prevent the use of 

nuclear weapons, to prevent their vertical and horizontal proliferation and to achieve 

nuclear disarmament;
