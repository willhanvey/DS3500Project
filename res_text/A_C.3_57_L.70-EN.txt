The General Assembly,

Recalling that the serious violations of Cambodian and international law
during the period of Democratic Kampuchea from 1975 to 1979 continue to be
matters of vitally important concern to the international community as a whole,

Recognizing the legitimate concern of the Government and people of
Cambodia in the pursuit of justice and national reconciliation, stability, peace and
security,

Recognizing also that the accountability of individual perpetrators of grave
human rights violations is one of the central elements of any effective remedy for
victims of human rights violations and a key factor in ensuring a fair and equitable
justice system and, ultimately, reconciliation and stability within a State,

Conscious that the opportunity to bring those responsible to justice may soon
be lost,

Recalling the request made in June 1997 by the Cambodian authorities for
assistance in responding to past serious violations of Cambodian and international
law,

Recalling also its resolution 56/169 of 19 December 2001, taking note of
Commission of Human Rights resolution 2002/89 of 26 April 2002,1 and recalling
further previous relevant resolutions,

Welcoming the efforts of, and the substantial progress made by, the Secretary-
General and the Government of Cambodia towards the establishment of
Extraordinary Chambers within the existing court structure of Cambodia, with
