  Australia, France, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Nigeria, Republic of 

Korea, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 

and United States of America: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming all its previous resolutions and presidential statements concerning 

the situation in Sudan and underlining the importance of full compliance with these,  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, unity, independence and 

territorial integrity of Sudan and its determination to work with the Government of 

Sudan, in full respect of its sovereignty, to assist in tackling the various challenges 

in Sudan,  

 Recalling the importance of the principles of the peaceful settlement of 

international disputes, good neighbourliness, non-interference and cooperation in 

the relations among States in the region,  

 Recalling its resolution 2086 (2013) and reaffirming the basic principles of 

peacekeeping, including consent of the parties, impartiality, and non-use of force, 

except in self-defence and defence of the mandate, and recognizing that the mandate 

of each peacekeeping mission is specific to the need and situation of the country 

concerned,  

 Commending the efforts of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid 

Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) towards promoting peace and stability in Darfur, 

and reiterating its full support for UNAMID,  

 Expressing deep concern at the considerable deterioration of the security 

situation in Darfur during 2013, with continued clashes between the Government of 

Sudan and rebel armed groups and an intensification of inter-communal violence, 

including with the involvement of elements of paramilitary units and tribal militias, 

which has become the main source of violence against civilians and of population 

displacement,  

 Expressing concern at the prevalence of arms in Darfur and the continued 

threats to civilians posed by unexploded ordnance,  

 Expressing deep concern at the impact of deteriorating security on the civilian 

population, including the significant increase in population displacements in 2013, 

and the consequent increase in humanitarian and protection needs, including related 

to sexual and gender-based violence and violence against children; noting that 

humanitarian actors were able to reach the majority of people in need of

humanitarian assistance in Darfur in 2013, with the notable exception of those 

vulnerable populations in areas of active fighting, including the East Jebel Marra 

region; in this regard, expressing particular concern at reports of an escalation of 

violence in Darfur since February 2014, resulting in the displacement of a large 

number of civilians, and at the denial of access for UNAMID and humanitarian 

actors to the affected areas by the Sudanese authorities; and further expressing 

concern over the insufficient availability of funding for humanitarian actors ,  

 Reiterating its strong condemnation of attacks against UNAMID, and its call 

on the Government of Sudan swiftly to investigate these attacks and to bring the 

perpetrators to justice, and on all parties in Darfur to cooperate fully with the 

Mission,  

 Reiterating that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Darfur, and 

that an inclusive political settlement is essential to re-establishing peace, and 

underscoring the importance of fully addressing the root causes of the conflict in the 

search for a sustainable peace, which should rapidly deliver real benefits for the 

Darfuri people, in this regard reiterating its support for the Doha Document for 

Peace in Darfur (DDPD) as a solid basis for the Darfur peace process, and for its 

accelerated implementation,  

 Noting in this regard that UNAMID’s ability to facilitate progress in 

implementation of the DDPD is hampered by delays by the signatory parties and the 

absence of an inclusive political settlement between the government and  

non-signatory movements, expressing concern that the humanitarian and security 

situation, as well as lack of capacity of the Darfur Regional Authority, hinder the 

transition from relief to stabilization and development activities, urging donors to 

honour their pledges and fulfil their obligations in a timely manner, including those 

commitments made at the conference in Doha in April 2013, and affirming that 

development can support a lasting peace in Darfur,  

 Commending the efforts of Joint Special Representative Mohamed ibn Chambas 

to revitalize the peace process, including through renewed engagement of the  

non-signatory movements, and urging all parties to the conflict to cease all acts of 

violence immediately, and to engage in the peace process without preconditions on 

the basis of the DDPD, in order to bring a durable and stable peace to the region,  

 Encouraging the Joint Special Representative to continue his efforts to 

increase the inclusiveness of the political process, guided by the Framework for AU 

and United Nations Facilitation of the Darfur Peace Process, and to coordinate with 

the African Union-High Level Implementation Panel (AU-HIP) and the United 

Nations Special Envoy for Sudan and South Sudan to synchronize their mediation 

efforts while taking into account ongoing transformation at the national level, 

welcoming in this regard the announcement by President Bashir on 27 January of a 

national dialogue, noting that the modalities of such a dialogue should provide an 

opportunity to address the legitimate grievances of the people of Darfur, looking 

forward to further developments towards the implementation of an inclusive 

dialogue process, and stressing the importance of the effective participation of 

women in this process, and in efforts towards peace in Darfur,  

 Noting that local dispute resolution mechanisms play an important role in 

preventing and resolving inter-communal conflict, including conflict over natural  

resources, and urging an intensification of effective efforts to prevent local disputes 



 
S/2014/236

leading to violence, with its corresponding impact on the local civilian populations, 

acknowledging the efforts of Sudanese authorities and local mediators to mediate in 

inter-tribal fighting, with support from UNAMID and the United Nations Country 

Team (UNCT), and urging their continued work,  

 Welcoming that, over the last year, cooperation between UNAMID and the 

Government of Sudan has resulted in improvements in mandate implementation, 

including through the more timely issuance of visas, but expressing deep concern 

that continued access restrictions and delays in the issuance of customs clearances 

for contingent-owned equipment significantly undermine UNAMID’s effect iveness, 

and further expressing deep concern that the delivery of humanitarian assistance is 

constrained and delayed by particular restrictions facing humanitarian actors, and 

that insufficient cooperation by the Government, particularly in terms of access , 

seriously constrains the Mission’s ability to operate,  

 Expressing deep concern that shortfalls in the operational capabilities of some 

military and police components seriously constrain the force’s mobility, 

effectiveness and ability to deter and respond robustly to attacks,  

 Noting the need for effective coordination and integration structures within 

UNAMID, and between UNAMID and UNCT, and encouraging swift development 

and implementation of a clearer strategic vision, priorities and a strategic and 

operational planning system within UNAMID, as well as an improved early warning 

and response mechanism and coordination of protection of civilians activities with 

UNCT,  

 Recalling the AU Peace and Security Council Communiqué of 24 March 2014, 

 1. Welcomes and endorses the Secretary-General’s Special Report of  

25 February 2014 (S/2014/138) on the review of the African Union-United Nations 

Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) and its recommendations, pursuant to 

Security Council resolution 2113 (2013);  

 2. Takes note of the proposed adjustment of the benchmarks and indicators 

for UNAMID outlined in the Secretary-General’s report S/2014/138, and requests 

the Secretary-General to further refine these benchmarks and indicators to reflect 

the revised strategic priorities of the Mission, and submit them in his next 90 -day 

report;  

 3. Stresses the important role of the AU in supporting implementation of the 

review of UNAMID; and welcomes the continued efforts of the Joint Support 

Coordination Mechanism, including in performing important coordination, support 

and liaison functions;  

 4. Endorses UNAMID’s revised strategic priorities of: the protection of 

civilians, the facilitation of the delivery of humanitarian assistance and the safety 

and security of humanitarian personnel; mediation between the Government of 

Sudan and non-signatory armed movements on the basis of the DDPD, while taking 

into account ongoing democratic transformation at the national level; and support to 

the mediation of community conflict, including through measures to address its root 

causes, in conjunction with UNCT;  

 5. Requests UNAMID to focus and streamline its activities, across its 

military, police and civilian components in order to achieve progress on these three 

strategic priorities, recognizes that their effective implementation will require

certain Mission tasks to be deprioritized and requests the Secretary-General to 

include these tasks in his next regular report on UNAMID;  

 6. Takes note of the Secretary-General’s intention to reduce UNAMID’s 

police component swiftly, in order to increase the effectiveness of that component, 

requests the Secretary-General to provide detailed and updated information on the 

implementation of this reduction in his next report, and stresses in this regard the 

importance of effective deployment, training and operational capabili ty of 

UNAMID’s police component; 

 7. Notes that UNAMID faces three major challenges in the effective 

discharge of its mandate, in the light of the evolving political and security 

environment, namely: the cooperation and partnership of the Government of Sudan 

in mandate implementation; major shortfalls in several troop- and police-contingent 

operational capabilities; and the need for improved coordination and integration 

structures within UNAMID and between UNAMID and UNCT;  

 8. Requests that UNAMID identify, in the context of these challenges,  steps 

by which it will achieve its revised strategic priorities more effectively, and further 

requests the Secretary-General to report on these steps in his regular reports to the 

Council on UNAMID;  

 9. Welcomes the planned efforts on the part of the United Nations and the 

relevant troop- and police-contributing countries to address shortfalls in the 

operational capabilities of some contingents, including enhanced engagement by the 

African Union and United Nations Secretariat with these countries, and encourages 

UNAMID to move to a more preventive and pre-emptive posture in pursuit of its 

priorities and in active defence of its mandate, building on positive steps taken so 

far, without prejudice to the agreed basic principles of peacekeeping;  

 10. Stresses the need to address gaps in the integrated strategic and 

operational architecture of UNAMID, calls on UNAMID and UNCT to put in place 

the full requirements of the United Nations Policy on Integrated Assessment and 

Planning, including the establishment of integrated mechanisms for joint analysis, 

planning, coordination, monitoring, and decision-making, especially for joint 

operational planning for the military and police on protection of civilians; further 

calls on the Secretariat to assist the Mission in these tasks, and requests that the 

Secretary-General include steps taken in this regard in his next regular report to the 

Council on UNAMID;  

 11. Notes with concern the strategic gap in mobility for the mission, and the 

continuing critical need for aviation capacity and other mobility assets, including 

military utility helicopters for UNAMID, calls on Member States to redouble their 

efforts to provide aviation units to the mission, and on the Government of Sudan to 

facilitate the deployment of those assets already pledged, and requests the 

Secretary-General to include information on related force generation efforts in his 

regular reports, and on what other strategies can offset this critical military gap; 

 12. Urges all relevant actors to implement the review of UNAMID swiftly 

and fully, requests the Secretary-General to include in his next regular report to the 

Council on UNAMID specific information and operational recommendations as 

required on the cost efficiency and reduction of the Mission’s military, po lice and 

civilian components to maximize Mission effectiveness in the implementation of its 



 
S/2014/236 

 

5/5 14-28948 

 

revised strategic priorities, and expresses its intention to make necessary 

adjustments accordingly;  

 13. Calls on all parties in Darfur to remove all obstacles to UNAMID’s full 

and proper discharge of its mandate, and calls on the Government of Sudan to 

comply with the Status of Forces Agreement fully and without delay, and to enhance 

its cooperation with UNAMID on the implementation of UNAMID’s mandate;  

 14. Stresses the importance of effective monitoring and evaluation of 

UNAMID’s impact in order to improve its effectiveness and looks forward to 

considering progress in implementation of the review on the basis of the Secretary -

General’s regular reports to the Council;  

 15. Looks forward to assessing the initial impact of implementation of the 

review before renewing UNAMID’s mandate in August 2014, and expresses its 

intention to ensure that UNAMID’s mandate reflects the revised strategic priorities 

set out in the Secretary-General’s Special Report;  

 16. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
