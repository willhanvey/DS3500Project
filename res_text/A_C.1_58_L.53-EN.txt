A path to the total elimination of nuclear weapons

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolutions 49/75 H of 15 December 1994, 50/70 C of 12
December 1995, 51/45 G of 10 December 1996, 52/38 K of 9 December 1997,

November 2000, 56/24 N of 29 November 2001 and 57/78 of 22 November 2002,

Recognizing that the enhancement of international peace and security and the
promotion of nuclear disarmament mutually complement and strengthen each other,

Expressing deep concern regarding the growing dangers posed by the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,

Convinced that every effort should be made to avoid nuclear devastation,

Reaffirming the crucial importance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons (NPT)1 as the cornerstone of the international regime for nuclear
non-proliferation and as an essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear
disarmament, and welcoming accession to the Treaty of Timor-Leste,

Bearing in mind that recent challenges to the Treaty and to the nuclear non-
proliferation regime have further increased the necessity of full compliance and that
the Treaty can fulfil its role only if there is confidence in compliance by all States
parties,

Recognizing the progress made by the nuclear-weapon States in the reduction
of their nuclear weapons unilaterally or through their negotiations, including the
recent entry into force of the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Reductions (“the
Moscow Treaty”) by the United States of America and the Russian Federation,2

which should serve as a step for further nuclear disarmament, and the efforts for
nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation by the international community,

Reaffirming the conviction that further advancement in nuclear disarmament
will contribute to consolidating the international regime for nuclear non-
proliferation, ensuring international peace and security,

Welcoming the continuation of a moratorium on nuclear-weapon-test
explosions or any other nuclear explosions since the last nuclear tests,

seminars and conferences, the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards
system will be further strengthened, by means of universalization of safeguards
agreements and the additional protocols,

Encouraging the Russian Federation and the United States of America to
continue their intensive consultations in accordance with the Joint Declaration on
the New Strategic Relationship between the two States,2

Welcoming the Final Declaration of the Third Conference on Facilitating the

Recognizing the importance of preventing terrorists from acquiring or
developing nuclear weapons or related materials, radioactive materials, equipment
