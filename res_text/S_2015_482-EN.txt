  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 

draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council,  

 Reaffirming all its previous resolutions and presidential statements concerning 

the situation in Sudan and underlining the importance of full compliance with these,  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, unity, independence and 

territorial integrity of Sudan and its determination to work with the Government of 

Sudan, in full respect of its sovereignty, to assist in tackling the various challenges 

in Sudan,  

 Recalling the importance of the principles of the peaceful settlement of 

international disputes, good neighbourliness, non-interference and cooperation in 

the relations among States in the region,  

 Reaffirming the basic principles of peacekeeping, including consent of the 

parties, impartiality and non-use of force, except in self-defence and defence of the 

mandate, and recognizing that the mandate of each peacekeeping mission is specific 

to the country concerned,  

 Recalling all its relevant resolutions on women, peace and security, on 

children and armed conflicts, on the protection of humanitarian and United Nations 

personnel, and on the protection of civilians in armed conflicts,  

 Expressing deep concern at the serious deterioration in the security situation in 

Darfur overall so far in 2015, and the profound negative impact of this on c ivilians, 

in particular women and children, in particular through a marked escalation of 

hostilities between Government forces and rebel armed groups, as well as an 

escalation of inter-communal conflicts over land, access to resources, migration 

issues and tribal rivalries, including with the involvement of paramilitary units and 

tribal militias, and a rise in criminality and banditry targeting the local population; 

further expressing deep concern that the deteriorating security situation, as 

characterised by attacks by rebel groups and Government forces, aerial 

bombardment, by the Government of Sudan, inter-tribal fighting, banditry and 

criminality, continues to threaten civilians; and reiterating its demand that all parties 

to the conflict in Darfur immediately end violence, including attacks on civilians, 

peacekeepers and humanitarian personnel,  

 In this regard, expressing concern at evidence, collected by AU-UN Hybrid 

Operation in Darfur (UNAMID), of two air-delivered cluster bombs near Kirigiyati, 

North Darfur, taking note that UNAMID disposed of them safely, and reiterating the 



S/2015/482 
 

 

15-10797 2/12 

 

Secretary-General’s call on the Government of Sudan to immediately investigate the 

use of cluster munitions, 

 Emphasizing that those responsible for violations of international humanitarian 

law and violations and abuses of human rights must be held accountable and that the 

Government of Sudan bears the primary responsibility to protect civilians within its 

territory and subject to its jurisdiction, including protection from crimes against 

humanity and war crimes, 

 Recalling its resolution 2117 (2013) and expressing concern at the threat to 

peace and security in Darfur arising from the illicit transfer, destabilizing 

accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons, and the continued threats 

to civilians posed by unexploded ordnance,  

 Expressing deep concern at the significant increase in population 

displacements in 2014 and so far in 2015 and the consequent increase in 

humanitarian assistance and protection needs, with 430,000newly displaced in 2014, 

around 300,000 of whom have been unable to return to their homes, a total number 

of long-term Internally-Displaced Persons (IDPs) of 2.5 million and a total number 

of people in need of humanitarian assistance of 4.4 million,  

 Recalling the commitments made by the Government of Sudan and other 

signatories to the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD) to ensure the 

unimpeded access of humanitarian assistance to the population in need and the 

protection of humanitarian workers and their operations in areas under their control, 

as well as to guarantee UNAMID unimpeded freedom of movement in all areas and 

at all times in Darfur in the exercise of its mandate, and further recalling the role of 

the Implementation Follow-up Commission (IFC) in assessing the implementation 

of the DDPD, 

 Expressing concern that the continued denial of access and restrictions 

imposed on humanitarian actors have left significant gaps in the delivery of 

humanitarian assistance, calling on the Government of Sudan to ensure 

humanitarian actors can operate in support of addressing basic needs,  

 Calling on donors, the Darfur Regional Authority and the Government of 

Sudan to provide the financial resources necessary to reach those in need,  

 Reiterating that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Darfur, and 

that an inclusive political settlement is essential to re -establishing peace, and 

underscoring the importance of fully addressing the root causes of the conflict in the 

search for a sustainable peace, which should rapidly deliver real benefits for the 

Darfuri people, in this regard reiterating its support for the DDPD as a viable 

framework for the peace process in Darfur, and for its accelerated implementation, 

as well as the AU High-Level Implementation Panel (AU-HIP) mediated peace 

talks, and any credible moves to lay the groundwork for an inclusive, 

comprehensive and nationally-owned National Dialogue in Sudan,  

 Deploring the fact that some armed groups are impeding the peace process and 

have continued to resort to violence, reiterating its demand for the release of 

members of the former movement of Mohamed Bashar, taken captive in May 2013 

by JEM-Gibril forces, and condemning any actions by any armed group aimed at 

forced overthrow of the Government of Sudan,  



 
S/2015/482 

 

3/12 15-10797 

 

 Noting that UNAMID’s ability to facilitate progress in implementation of the 

DDPD is hampered by delays and the absence of an inclusive political settlement 

between the government and non-signatory movements, urging the signatory parties 

to take the necessary remaining steps to implement the DDPD fully, expressing 

concern that the humanitarian and security situation, as well as the lack of capacity 

of the Darfur Regional Authority, hinder the transition from relief to stabilizati on 

and development activities, urging donors and the Government of Sudan to honour 

their pledges and fulfil their obligations in a timely manner, including those 

commitments made at the conference in Doha in April 2013, and affirming that 

development can support a lasting peace in Darfur,  

 Noting that local dispute resolution mechanisms play an important role in 

preventing and resolving inter-communal conflict, including conflict over natural 

resources, urging an intensification of effective efforts to prevent local disputes 

leading to violence, with its corresponding impact on the local civilian populations, 

acknowledging the efforts of Sudanese authorities and local mediators to mediate in 

inter-tribal fighting, with support from UNAMID and the UN Country Team 

(UNCT), and urging their continued work,  

 Welcoming regional and other initiatives, undertaken in close interaction with 

the Government of Sudan, to address the root causes of the conflict in Darfur and to 

promote a sustainable peace, including the convening by the President of Chad, 

Idriss Deby Itno, of two mediation fora, encouraging the full coordination of such 

initiatives with the efforts of the Joint Special Representative (JSR), and 

commending the efforts of the JSR to secure peace, stability and security in Darfur, 

including through support to international, regional and national efforts to revitalise 

the peace process and increase its inclusiveness,  

 Underlining, without prejudice to the Security Council’s primary responsibility  

for the maintenance of international peace and security, the importance of the 

partnership between the United Nations and the African Union (AU), consistent 

with Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations, with regard to the 

maintenance of peace and security in Africa, particularly in Sudan,  

 Calling on all parties to comply with their obligations under international 

human rights law and international humanitarian law, stressing the importance that 

the Council attaches to ending impunity including through ensuring accountability 

and bringing to justice the perpetrators of crimes committed by all parties in Darfur, 

urging the Government of Sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect, 

welcoming the ongoing investigations by the Special Prosecutor for Darfur  

appointed by the Government of Sudan and stressing the need for further progress in 

this regard, reiterating the call for swift progress on the draft Memorandum of 

Understanding providing for UNAMID and African Union observation of the 

proceedings of the Special Court, and calling on the Government of Sudan swiftly 

to investigate attacks against UNAMID, and to bring the perpetrators to justice,  

 Reaffirming its concern over the negative effect of ongoing violence in Darfur 

on the stability of Sudan as a whole as well as the region, welcoming the ongoing 

good relations between Sudan and Chad, including on border control, and 

encouraging Sudan, Chad and the Central African Republic to continue to cooperate 

in order to achieve peace and stability in Darfur and the wider region,
