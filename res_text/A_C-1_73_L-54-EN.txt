 Stressing also the importance of the Review Conference of the Parties to the 

Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to be held in 2020, on the 

occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty, and of its 

review cycle towards the 2020 Review Conference,  

 Reaffirming that the enhancement of international peace and security and the 

promotion of nuclear disarmament are mutually reinforcing and that it i s in the 

common interest of all States to improve the international security environment and 

pursue a world free of nuclear weapons in line with article VI of the Treaty on the 

Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,  

 Emphasizing the crucial importance of rebuilding trust and enhancing 

cooperation among all States in order to make substantive progress in nuclear 

disarmament and non-proliferation, bearing in mind there are various approaches 

towards the realization of a world free of nuclear weapons,  

 Mindful, in this regard, that civility in discourse and respect for divergent views 

contribute to facilitating a meaningful and realistic dialogue, which enables the 

international community to reduce nuclear dangers and move forward towards a world 

free of nuclear weapons,

of Korea of 12 June 2018 as a positive step toward the final, fully verified 

denuclearization of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,  

 Recalling, in this context, that the repeated unlawful nuclear tests and frequent 

missile launches by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea using ballistic missile 

technology proscribed by the United Nations pose unprecedented, grave and 

imminent threats to the peace and security of the region and the world, present grave 

challenges to the regime centred on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 

Weapons, and constitute clear and repeated violations of the relevant Security Council 

resolutions, and reiterating the resolute opposition of the international community to 

the possession of nuclear weapons by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,
