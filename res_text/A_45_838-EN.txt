members of their families frequently find themselves owing, among other things, to
their absence from the State of origin and to the c3ifficulties  they may encounter
arising from their presence in the State of employment,

have not been sufficiently recncjnised everywhere a:ld therefore require appropriate
international protection,

-into account  the fact that migration is often the cause of serious
problems for the members of the families of migrant workers ae well as for the
workers themselves, in particular because of the scattering of the family,

w in ~ that the human problems involved in migration are even more
serious in the case of irregular migration and convinced therefore that appropriate
action should be encouraged in order to prevent and eliminate clandestine movements
and trafficking in migrant workers , while at the same time sssuring the protection
of their fundamental human rights,

wing that workers who are non-documented or in an irregular situation
are frequently employed under lean favourable conditions of work than other workers
and that certain employors find this an inducement to seek such labour in order to
reap the benefits of unfair competition,
