Recalling also all of its relevant resolutions, in which, inter alia, it condemned

and the threat they pose to the integrity and respect of the constitutional order of
those countries,

financing, training and transit of mercenaries for the planning of activities designed
to impede the right of peoples to self-determination, to destabilize or overthrow the
Government of any State or to dismember or impair, totally or in part, the territorial

activities and to those responsible for the use, recruitment, financing and training of
mercenaries, and urges all States, in accordance with their obligations under
international law, to bring them, without distinction, to justice;

12. Requests the new Special Rapporteur on mercenaries to circulate to and
