 Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political 

independence and unity of Somalia, and underscoring the importance of working to 

prevent destabilising effects of regional disputes from spilling over into Somalia,  

 Recalling paragraphs 1 to 8 of resolution 2444 (2018), and reaffirming that it 

will continue to follow developments towards the normalisation of relations between 

Eritrea and Djibouti and will support the two countries in the resolution of these 

matters in good faith, 

 Expressing its support for the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) in its 

efforts to reconstruct the country, counter the threat of terrorism, and stop the 

movement of illegal arms and armed groups, further expressing its intention to ensure 

the measures in this resolution will enable the FGS in the realisation of these 

objectives, noting that the security situation in Somalia continues to necessitate these 

measures, including strict controls on the movement of arms but affirming that it shall 

keep the situation in Somalia under constant review and that it shall be prepared to 

review the appropriateness of the measures contained in this resolution, including any 

modification, possible benchmarks, suspension or lifting of the measures, as may be 

needed in light of the progress achieved and compliance with this resolution,

Federal Member States (FMS), emphasising the importance of co-operation and 

coordination between the FGS and the FMS and implementation of the National 

Security Architecture, recalling resolution 2520 and reiterating the importance of 

further progress on updating, reviewing and implementing the Somalia Transition 

Plan (STP), and noting that a successful transition to Somali-led security from the

is fundamental to the maintenance of peace and stability in the region,  

 Condemning Al-Shabaab attacks in Somalia and beyond, expressing grave 

concern that Al-Shabaab continues to pose a serious threat to the peace, security and 

stability of Somalia and the region, particularly through its increased use of

continued presence in Somalia of affiliates linked to Islamic State in Iraq and the

including developing an accountable weapons tracing system for all Somali security

regarding its needs in developing its National Security Forces, noting that these forces 

require access to weapons and specialist equipment, in accordance with the measures 

in this resolution, in order to perform their functions effectively,  

 Condemning the supply of weapons and ammunition supplies to and through 

Somalia in violation of the arms embargo, especially when they reach Al-Shabaab 

and affiliates linked to ISIL, and when they undermine the sovereignty and territorial 

integrity of Somalia, as a serious threat to peace and stability in the region, and further 

condemning continued illegal supply of weapons, ammunition and IED components 

from Yemen to Somalia,  

 Recognising that the threat posed by Al-Shabaab to peace, security and stability 

in Somalia and the region goes beyond the group’s conventional military ac tion and 

asymmetric warfare, expressing serious concern at Al-Shabaab’s ability to generate 

revenue as documented in the final report of the Panel of Experts (the Panel) on 

Somalia (S/2020/949) welcoming the FGS’ efforts to strengthen the Somali Financial

to support this process,  

 Welcoming measures taken by the FGS, FMS and United Nations Member States 

with charcoal destination markets to reduce the export of charcoal, urging monitoring 

and control of existing charcoal stockpiles at export points, encouraging further 

development of Somalia’s National Policy on Charcoal which aims to develop the 

sustainable management of domestic charcoal use expressing concern at continued 

reports of illegal and unregulated fishing in waters where Somalia has jurisdiction, 

noting the link between illegal fishing and Al-Shabaab’s ability to generate revenue, 

encouraging the Somali authorities, with support from the international community, 

to ensure fishing licenses are issued in accordance with the appropriate Somali 

legislation, and further encouraging the FGS, FMS and Somali authorities to work 

with the UNODC, their international partners and other stakeholders to improve 

maritime domain awareness. 

 Expressing concern at the continued reports of corruption and diversion of 

public resources in Somalia, welcoming efforts made by the FGS to reduce corruption 

including the enactment of the Anti-Corruption Law on 21 September 2019 and

combined threat posed by flooding, locust infestation and COVID-19 and condemning

assistance, any misappropriation or diversion of any humanitarian funds or supplies, 

and acts of violence against or harassment of humanitarian workers,  

 Noting the adoption of conclusions on Children and Armed Conflict in Somalia 

on 11 August 2020 by the Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed 

Conflict, further noting with concern reports, including from the Secretary General 

of the United Nations, which document worrying levels of sexual and gender based 

violence in Somalia, and urging the Somali authorities to further strengthen efforts to 

address this, including by implementing measures in line with resolution 2467 (2019). 

 Taking note with appreciation of the final report of the Panel and the technical 

assessment mission report of the Secretary-General (S/2019/616), welcoming the 

increased cooperation between the Panel and the FGS, regretting, due to the 

COVID-19 pandemic, the reduced ability of the Panel to visit Somalia and the wider 

impact of the pandemic on the Panel’s work in 2020, and urging all parties to find a 

way forward which will enable the Security Council to better assess and monitor 

compliance with the sanctions regime, and recalling that panels of experts operate
