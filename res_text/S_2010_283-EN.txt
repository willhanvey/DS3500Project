  France, Germany, United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland and United States of America: 
draft resolution* 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling the Statement of its President, S/PRST/2006/15, and its resolutions 
1696 (2006), 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007), 1803 (2008), 1835 (2008), and 1887 (2009) 
and reaffirming their provisions,  

 Reaffirming its commitment to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons, the need for all States Party to that Treaty to comply fully with all their 
obligations, and recalling the right of States Party, in conformity with Articles I 
and II of that Treaty, to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for 
peaceful purposes without discrimination,  

 Recalling the resolution of the IAEA Board of Governors (GOV/2006/14), 
which states that a solution to the Iranian nuclear issue would contribute to global 
non-proliferation efforts and to realizing the objective of a Middle East free of 
weapons of mass destruction, including their means of delivery,  

 Noting with serious concern that, as confirmed by the reports of 27 February 
2006 (GOV/2006/15), 8 June 2006 (GOV/2006/38), 31 August 2006 (GOV/2006/53), 
14 November 2006 (GOV/2006/64), 22 February 2007 (GOV/2007/8), 23 May 2007 
(GOV/2007/22), 30 August 2007 (GOV/2007/48), 15 November 2007 (GOV/2007/58), 
22 February 2008 (GOV/2008/4), 26 May 2008 (GOV/2008/15), 15 September 2008 
(GOV/2008/38), 19 November 2008 (GOV/2008/59), 19 February 2009

2010 (GOV/2010/28) of the Director General of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), Iran has not established full and sustained suspension of all 
enrichment-related and reprocessing activities and heavy water-related projects as 
set out in resolutions 1696 (2006), 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007) and 1803 (2008) nor 
resumed its cooperation with the IAEA under the Additional Protocol, nor 
cooperated with the IAEA in connection with the remaining issues of concern, 
which need to be clarified to exclude the possibility of military dimensions of Iran’s 
nuclear programme, nor taken the other steps required by the IAEA Board of 
Governors, nor complied with the provisions of Security Council resolutions 1696

(2006), 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007) and 1803 (2008) and which are essential to build 
confidence, and deploring Iran’s refusal to take these steps,  

 Reaffirming that outstanding issues can be best resolved and confidence built 
in the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme by Iran responding 
positively to all the calls which the Council and the IAEA Board of Governors have 
made on Iran,  

 Noting with serious concern the role of elements of the Islamic Revolutionary 
Guard Corps (IRGC, also known as “Army of the Guardians of the Islamic 
Revolution”), including those specified in Annex D and E of resolution 1737 (2006), 
Annex I of resolution 1747 (2007) and Annex II of this resolution, in Iran’s 
proliferation sensitive nuclear activities and the development of nuclear weapon 
delivery systems,  

 Noting with serious concern that Iran has constructed an enrichment facility at 
Qom in breach of its obligations to suspend all enrichment-related activities, and 
that Iran failed to notify it to the IAEA until September 2009, which is inconsistent 
with its obligations under the Subsidiary Arrangements to its Safeguards Agreement,  

 Also noting the resolution of the IAEA Board of Governors (GOV/2009/82), 
which urges Iran to suspend immediately construction at Qom, and to clarify the 
facility’s purpose, chronology of design and construction, and calls upon Iran to 
confirm, as requested by the IAEA, that it has not taken a decision to construct, or 
authorize construction of, any other nuclear facility which has as yet not been 
declared to the IAEA,  

 Noting with serious concern that Iran has enriched uranium to 20 per cent, and 
did so without notifying the IAEA with sufficient time for it to adjust the existing 
safeguards procedures, 

 Noting with concern that Iran has taken issue with the IAEA’s right to verify 
design information which had been provided by Iran pursuant to the modified 
Code 3.1, and emphasizing that in accordance with Article 39 of Iran’s Safeguards 
Agreement Code 3.1 cannot be modified nor suspended unilaterally and that the 
IAEA’s right to verify design information provided to it is a continuing right, which 
is not dependent on the stage of construction of, or the presence of nuclear material 
at, a facility,  

 Reiterating its determination to reinforce the authority of the IAEA, strongly 
supporting the role of the IAEA Board of Governors, and commending the IAEA for 
its efforts to resolve outstanding issues relating to Iran’s nuclear programme,  

 Expressing the conviction that the suspension set out in paragraph 2 of 
resolution 1737 (2006) as well as full, verified Iranian compliance with the 
requirements set out by the IAEA Board of Governors would contribute to a 
diplomatic, negotiated solution that guarantees Iran’s nuclear programme is for 
exclusively peaceful purposes,  

 Emphasizing the importance of political and diplomatic efforts to find a 
negotiated solution guaranteeing that Iran’s nuclear programme is exclusively for 
peaceful purposes and noting in this regard the efforts of Turkey and Brazil towards 
an agreement with Iran on the Tehran Research Reactor that could serve as a 
confidence-building measure,  



 S/2010/283
 

3 10-39655 
 

 Emphasizing also, however, in the context of these efforts, the importance of 
Iran addressing the core issues related to its nuclear programme, 

 Stressing that China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the United 
Kingdom and the United States are willing to take further concrete measures on 
exploring an overall strategy of resolving the Iranian nuclear issue through 
negotiation on the basis of their June 2006 proposals (S/2006/521) and their June 
2008 proposals (INFCIRC/730), and noting the confirmation by these countries that 
once the confidence of the international community in the exclusively peaceful 
nature of Iran’s nuclear programme is restored it will be treated in the same manner 
as that of any Non-Nuclear Weapon State Party to the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,  

 Welcoming the guidance issued by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to 
assist States in implementing their financial obligations under resolutions 1737 
(2006) and 1803 (2008), and recalling in particular the need to exercise vigilance 
over transactions involving Iranian banks, including the Central Bank of Iran, so as 
to prevent such transactions contributing to proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities, 
or to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems,  

 Recognizing that access to diverse, reliable energy is critical for sustainable 
growth and development, while noting the potential connection between Iran’s 
revenues derived from its energy sector and the funding of Iran’s proliferation-
sensitive nuclear activities, and further noting that chemical process equipment and 
materials required for the petrochemical industry have much in common with those 
required for certain sensitive nuclear fuel cycle activities,  

 Having regard to States’ rights and obligations relating to international trade,  

 Recalling that the law of the sea, as reflected in the United Nations Convention 
on the Law of the Sea (1982), sets out the legal framework applicable to ocean 
activities, 

 Calling for the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty by 
Iran at an early date, 

 Determined to give effect to its decisions by adopting appropriate measures to 
persuade Iran to comply with resolutions 1696 (2006), 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007) 
and 1803 (2008) and with the requirements of the IAEA, and also to constrain Iran’s 
development of sensitive technologies in support of its nuclear and missile 
programmes, until such time as the Security Council determines that the objectives 
of these resolutions have been met,  

 Concerned by the proliferation risks presented by the Iranian nuclear 
programme and mindful of its primary responsibility under the Charter of the United 
Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security,  

 Stressing that nothing in this resolution compels States to take measures or 
actions exceeding the scope of this resolution, including the use of force or the 
threat of force,  

 Acting under Article 41 of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 1. Affirms that Iran has so far failed to meet the requirements of the IAEA 
Board of Governors and to comply with resolutions 1696 (2006), 1737 (2006), 1747 
(2007) and 1803 (2008);  



S/2010/283  
 

10-39655 4 
 

 2. Affirms that Iran shall without further delay take the steps required by the 
IAEA Board of Governors in its resolutions GOV/2006/14 and GOV/2009/82, which 
are essential to build confidence in the exclusively peaceful purpose of its nuclear 
programme, to resolve outstanding questions and to address the serious concerns 
raised by the construction of an enrichment facility at Qom in breach of its 
obligations to suspend all enrichment-related activities, and, in this context, further 
affirms its decision that Iran shall without delay take the steps required in 
paragraph 2 of resolution 1737 (2006);  

 3. Reaffirms that Iran shall cooperate fully with the IAEA on all outstanding 
issues, particularly those which give rise to concerns about the possible military 
dimensions of the Iranian nuclear programme, including by providing access 
without delay to all sites, equipment, persons and documents requested by the 
IAEA, and stresses the importance of ensuring that the IAEA have all necessary 
resources and authority for the fulfilment of its work in Iran;

Security Council all his reports on the application of safeguards in Iran;  

 5. Decides that Iran shall without delay comply fully and without 
qualification with its IAEA Safeguards Agreement, including through the 
application of modified Code 3.1 of the Subsidiary Arrangement to its Safeguards 
Agreement, calls upon Iran to act strictly in accordance with the provisions of the 
Additional Protocol to its IAEA Safeguards Agreement that it signed on 
18 December 2003, calls upon Iran to ratify promptly the Additional Protocol, and 
reaffirms that, in accordance with Articles 24 and 39 of Iran’s Safeguards 
Agreement, Iran’s Safeguards Agreement and its Subsidiary Arrangement, including 
modified Code 3.1, cannot be amended or changed unilaterally by Iran, and notes 
that there is no mechanism in the Agreement for the suspension of any of the 
provisions in the Subsidiary Arrangement; 

 6. Reaffirms that, in accordance with Iran’s obligations under previous 
resolutions to suspend all reprocessing, heavy water-related and enrichment-related 
activities, Iran shall not begin construction on any new uranium-enrichment, 
reprocessing, or heavy water-related facility and shall discontinue any ongoing 
construction of any uranium-enrichment, reprocessing, or heavy water-related 
facility; 

 7. Decides that Iran shall not acquire an interest in any commercial activity 
in another State involving uranium mining, production or use of nuclear materials 
and technology as listed in INFCIRC/254/Rev.9/Part 1, in particular uranium-
enrichment and reprocessing activities, all heavy-water activities or technology 
related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and further 
decides that all States shall prohibit such investment in territories under their 
jurisdiction by Iran, its nationals, and entities incorporated in Iran or subject to its 
jurisdiction, or by persons or entities acting on their behalf or at their direction, or 
by entities owned or controlled by them; 

 8. Decides that all States shall prevent the direct or indirect supply, sale or 
transfer to Iran, from or through their territories or by their nationals or individuals

accordance with paragraph 3 of resolution 1737 (2006), underlines that nothing in 
this paragraph shall oblige a State to refuse its own nationals entry into its territory, 
and decides that the measures imposed in this paragraph shall not apply when the 
Committee determines on a case-by-case basis that such travel is justified on the 
grounds of humanitarian need, including religious obligations, or where the 
Committee concludes that an exemption would otherwise further the objectives of 
this resolution, including where Article XV of the IAEA Statute is engaged;  

 11. Decides that the measures specified in paragraphs 12, 13, 14 and 15 of 
resolution 1737 (2006) shall apply also to the individuals and entities listed in

the transfer to, through, or from their territory, or to or by their nationals or entities 
organized under their laws (including branches abroad), or persons or financial 
institutions in their territory, of any financial or other assets or resources if they 
have information that provides reasonable grounds to believe that such services, 
assets or resources could contribute to Iran’s proliferation-sensitive nuclear 
activities, or the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems, including by 
freezing any financial or other assets or resources on their territories or that 
hereafter come within their territories, or that are subject to their jurisdiction or that 
hereafter become subject to their jurisdiction, that are related to such programmes or 
activities and applying enhanced monitoring to prevent all such transactions in 
accordance with their national authorities and legislation; 

 22. Decides that all States shall require their nationals, persons subject to

nuclear weapon delivery systems or to violations of resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 
(2007), 1803 (2008) or this resolution;  

 23. Calls upon States to take appropriate measures that prohibit in their 
territories the opening of new branches, subsidiaries, or representative offices of 
Iranian banks, and also that prohibit Iranian banks from establishing new joint

information that provides reasonable grounds to believe that such financial services 
could contribute to Iran’s proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities or the 
development of nuclear weapon delivery systems;  

 25. Deplores the violations of the prohibitions of paragraph 5 of resolution 
1747 (2007) that have been reported to the Committee since the adoption of
