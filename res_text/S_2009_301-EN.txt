  France, Japan, Republic of Korea, United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland and United States of America:  
draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous relevant resolutions, including resolution 825 (1993), 
resolution 1540 (2004), resolution 1695 (2006), and, in particular, resolution 1718 
(2006), as well as the statements of its President of 6 October 2006 
(S/PRST/2006/41) and 13 April 2009 (S/PRST/2009/7), 

 Reaffirming that proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as 
well as their means of delivery, constitutes a threat to international peace and 
security, 

 Expressing the gravest concern at the nuclear test conducted by the Democratic 
People’s Republic of Korea (“the DPRK”) on 25 May 2009 (local time) in violation 
of resolution 1718 (2006), and at the challenge such a test constitutes to the Treaty 
on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (“the NPT”) and to international efforts 
aimed at strengthening the global regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons 
towards the 2010 NPT Review Conference, and the danger it poses to peace and 
stability in the region and beyond, 

 Stressing its collective support for the NPT and commitment to strengthen the 
Treaty in all its aspects, and global efforts towards nuclear non-proliferation and 
nuclear disarmament, and recalling that the DPRK cannot have the status of a 
nuclear-weapon state in accordance with the NPT in any case, 

 Deploring the DPRK’s announcement of withdrawal from the NPT and its 
pursuit of nuclear weapons, 

 Underlining once again the importance that the DPRK respond to other 
security and humanitarian concerns of the international community, 

 Underlining also that measures imposed by this resolution are not intended to 
have adverse humanitarian consequences for the civilian population of the DPRK, 

 Expressing its gravest concern that the nuclear test and missile activities 
carried out by the DPRK have further generated increased tension in the region and 
beyond, and determining that there continues to exist a clear threat to international 
peace and security,
