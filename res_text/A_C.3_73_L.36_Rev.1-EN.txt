and promoting sustainable agriculture and on ending poverty in all its forms 

everywhere, 

 Recalling also the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social 

and Cultural Rights,5 in which the fundamental right of every person to be free from 

hunger is recognized, 

 Bearing in mind the importance of the Rome Declaration on World Food 

Security, the World Food Summit Plan of Action and the Declaration of the World 

Food Summit: five years later, adopted in Rome on 13 June 2002, 6  

 Reaffirming the importance of the recommendations contained in the Voluntary 

Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in 

the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and 

Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004,7 as well as the 

Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the Framework for Action, adopted in Rome on 

21 November 2014,8  

 Acknowledging that the right to food has been recognized as the right of every 

individual, alone or in community with others, to have physical and economic access 

at all times to sufficient, adequate, nutritious food, in conformity with, inter alia, the 

culture, beliefs, traditions, dietary habits and preferences of individuals, that is 

produced and consumed sustainably, thereby preserving access to food for future 

generations, 

 Reaffirming the Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security 

contained in the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted in Rome 

on 16 November 2009,9  

 Recalling the proclamation by the General Assembly at its seventy-second 

session of 2019–2028 as the United Nations Decade of Family Farming and the close 

links between family farming, the promotion and conservation of historical, cultural 

and natural heritage, traditional customs and culture, halting the loss of biodiversity 

and the improvement of the living conditions of people living in rural areas,  

 Reaffirming that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 

interrelated and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the 

same footing and with the same emphasis,  

 Reaffirming also that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and 

economic environment, at both the national and the international leve ls, is the 

essential foundation that will enable States to give adequate priority to food and 

nutrition security and poverty eradication,  

 Reiterating, as set out in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security, the 

Declaration of the World Food Summit and the Rome Declaration on Nutrition, that 

food should not be used as an instrument of political or economic pressure, and 

reaffirming in this regard the importance of international cooperation and solidarity, 

as well as the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures that are not in 

accordance with international law and the Charter and that endanger food and 

nutrition security, 

 Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources 

and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations

3/11 18-19155 

 

contained in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food 

Summit Plan of Action, as well as in the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the 

Framework for Action, and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally 

in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food and nutrition security 

in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies where 

coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential,  

 Recognizing that, despite the efforts made and the fact that some positive results 

have been achieved, the problems of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition have a 

global dimension, that there has not been sufficient progress in reducing hunger and 

that these problems are increasing dramatically in some regions in the absence of 

urgent, determined and concerted action,  

 Recognizing also the importance of traditional sustainable agricultural 

practices, including traditional seed supply systems, as well as  access to credit and 

other financial services, markets, secure land tenure, health care, social services, 

education, training, knowledge and appropriate and affordable technologies, 

including efficient irrigation, the reuse of treated wastewater and water  harvesting 

and storage for indigenous peoples and others living in rural areas,  

 Recognizing further the complex character of food insecurity and its likely 

recurrence owing to a combination of several major factors, such as the effects of the 

global financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, desertification and 

the impacts of global climate change, as well as poverty, natural disasters, armed 

conflicts, drought, volatility in commodity prices and the lack in many countries of 

the appropriate technology, investment and capacity-building necessary to confront 

its impact, particularly in developing countries, the least developed countries and 

small island developing States, and the need for coherence and collaboration between 

international institutions at the global level, 

 Noting with great concern that millions of people are facing famine or the 

immediate risk of famine or are experiencing severe food insecurity in several regions 

of the world, and noting also that poverty, armed conflicts, drought and the volatility 

of commodity prices are among the factors causing or exacerbating famine and severe 

food insecurity and that additional efforts, including international support, to respond, 

prevent and prepare for increasing global food insecurity are urgently needed, 

 Stressing the obligation of all States and parties to an armed conflict to protect 

civilians, in accordance with international humanitarian law, and calling upon 

Member States, the United Nations and other relevant organizations to t ake further 

steps to provide a coordinated emergency response to the food and nutrition needs of 

affected populations, while aiming to ensure that such steps are supportive of national 

strategies and programmes aimed at improving food security and nutritio n, 

 Reaffirming that starvation of civilians as a method of combat is prohibited 

under international humanitarian law and that it is therefore prohibited to attack, 

destroy, remove or render useless, for that purpose, objects indispensable to the 

survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the 

production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies 

and irrigation works, 

 Resolved to act to ensure that the promotion, protection and fulfilment of all 

human rights and the human rights perspective are taken into account at the national, 

regional and international levels in measures to address the realization of the right to 

food, 

 Stressing the possible benefits of international trade to improve food and 

nutrition availability, 



A/C.3/73/L.36/Rev.1 
 

 

18-19155 4/11 

 

 Stressing also that improving access to productive resources and investment in 

rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in 

developing countries, through, inter alia, the promotion of investments in appropriate 

small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce 

vulnerability to droughts and tackle water scarcity, as well as in programmes, 

practices and policies to scale up sustainable agroecological approaches,  

 Expressing its deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters, 

diseases and pest infestations, as well as the negative impact of climate change, and 

their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in substantial loss of life 

and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food and nutrition security, 

in particular in developing countries,  

 Concerned that the impacts of climate change and natural disasters are harming 

agricultural productivity, food production and cropping patterns, thus contributing to 

food availability shortfalls, and that such impacts are expected to increase with future 

climate change, 

 Expressing its deep concern over the negative effects of armed conflicts on the 

enjoyment of the right to food,  

 Emphasizing that a multisectoral approach that integrates nutrition across all 

sectors, including agriculture, health, water and sanitation, social protection and 

education, as well as a gender perspective, is critical to achieving global food and 

nutrition security and the realization of the right to food,  

 Recalling the endorsement of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible 

Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food 

Security10 by the Committee on World Food Security at its thirty-eighth session, held 

on 11 May 2012, and by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 

United Nations at its 144th session,  

 Recalling also the Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and 

Food Systems,11 which were endorsed by the Committee on World Food Securi ty at 

its forty-first session, held from 13 to 18 October 2014,  

 Stressing the importance of the Second International Conference on Nutrition, 

hosted by the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization 

of the United Nations in Rome from 19 to 21 November 2014, and of its outcome 

documents, the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the Framework for Action,  

 Stressing also the need to increase official development assistance devoted to 

agriculture and nutrition,  

 Recognizing that small and medium-sized farmers in developing countries need 

to receive technical, technology transfer and capacity-building support, 

 Recognizing also the importance of the protection and preservation of 

agrobiodiversity in guaranteeing food security and nutrition and the right to food for 

all, 

 Noting the cultural values of dietary and eating habits in different cultures, and 

recognizing that food plays an important role in defining the identity of individuals 

and communities and is a cultural component that descr ibes and gives value to a 

territory and its inhabitants,

5/11 18-19155 

 

 Recognizing the role of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 

Nations as the key United Nations agency for rural and agricultural development and 

its work in supporting the efforts of Member States to achieve the full realization of 

the right to food, including through its provision of technical assistance to developing 

countries in support of the implementation of national priority frameworks,  

 Recognizing also the role of the Committee on World Food Security as an 

inclusive international and intergovernmental platform for a broad range of 

committed stakeholders to work together in a coordinated manner and in support of 

country-led processes towards the elimination of hunger and ensuring food security 

and nutrition for all human beings,  

 Acknowledging the contribution of parliamentarians nationally and regionally 

to the reduction of hunger and malnutrition and ultimately to the realization of the 

right to food, and in this regard recognizing the convening of the first Global 

Parliamentary Summit against Hunger and Malnutrition, held in Madrid on 29 and 

30 October 2018,  

 Recalling the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on 

Sustainable Development, entitled “The future we want”, and recalling the 

commitment therein to work together to promote sustained and inclusive economic 

growth, social development and environmental protection and thereby to benefit all, 

endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 66/288 of 27 July 2012, 

 Recalling also the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–203012 

and its guiding principles, which, inter alia, recognize the importance of promoting 

regular disaster preparedness and response and recovery exercises, with a view to 

ensuring rapid and effective response to disasters and related displacement, including 

access to essential food and non-food relief supplies, as appropriate to local needs, as 

well as of fostering collaboration across global and regional mechanisms and 

institutions for the implementation and coherence of instruments and tools relevant 

to disaster risk reduction, such as for climate change, biodiversity, sustainable 

development, poverty eradication, environment, agriculture, health, food and 

nutrition and others, as appropriate,  

 Recalling further the proclamation at its seventieth session of 2016–2025 as the 

United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition, and stressing the opportunity the 

Decade represents to bring together initiatives and efforts to eradicate hunger and 

prevent all forms of malnutrition,  

 Acknowledging the work done by the High-level Task Force on Global Food and 

Nutrition Security established by the Secretary-General, and supporting the 

Secretary-General in his continuing efforts in this regard, including continued 

engagement with Member States and the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights 

Council on the right to food, 

 1. Reaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human 

dignity and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, 

regional and international levels for its elimination;  

 2. Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe, sufficient and 

nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right 

of everyone to be free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his 

or her physical and mental capacities;  

 3. Considers it intolerable that, as estimated by the United Nations 

Children’s Fund, up to 45 per cent of the children who die every year before the age

of 5 die from undernutrition and hunger-related illness and that, as estimated by the 

Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the number of people in 

the world affected by undernourishment, or chronic food deprivation, increased from 

around 804 million in 2016 to nearly 821 million in 2017;  

 4. Expresses its concern at the fact that the effects created by the world food 

crisis still continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable 

people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by 

the impacts of the world financial and economic crisis, and at the particula r effects of 

the crisis on many net food-importing countries, especially the least developed 

countries; 

 5. Expresses its deep concern that, according to the report of the Food and 

Agriculture Organization of the United Nations entitled The State of Food Security 

and Nutrition in the World 2018, the number of hungry people in the world is 

unacceptably high, the vast majority of hungry people live in developing countries 

and the number of undernourished people in the world has been on the rise since 2016, 

reaching an estimated 821 million in 2017;  

 6. Also expresses its deep concern that, while women contribute more than 

50 per cent of the food produced worldwide, they also account for 70 per cent of the 

world’s hungry, that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food 

insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that 

in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and 

preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many 

women as men suffer from malnutrition;  

 7. Encourages all States to mainstream a gender perspective in food security 

programmes and to take action to address de jure and de facto gender inequality and 

discrimination against women, in particular when they contribute to the malnutrition 

of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the 

right to food and that women have equal access to resources, including income, land 

and water and their ownership and agricultural inputs, as well as full and equal access 

to health care, education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves 

and their families, and in this regard stresses the need to empower women and 

strengthen their role in decision-making; 

 8. Encourages the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the 

right to food to continue to mainstream a gender perspective in the fulfilment of her 

mandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 

Nations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms addressing the right to 

food and food insecurity and malnutrition to continue to integrate a gender 

perspective into their relevant policies, programmes and activities;  

 9. Reaffirms the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and 

nutritious food are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities;  

 10. Stresses that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect 

the right to food and that the international community should provide, through a 

coordinated response and upon request, international cooperation in support of 

national and regional efforts by providing the assistance necessary to increase food 

production and access to food, including through agricultural development assistance, 

the transfer of technology, food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid, ensuring 

food security, with special attention to the specific needs of women and girls, and 

promoting innovation, support for the development of adapted technologies, r esearch 

on rural advisory services and support for access to financing services, and ensure 

support for the establishment of secure land tenure systems;  



 
A/C.3/73/L.36/Rev.1 

 

7/11 18-19155 

 

 11. Calls upon all States and, if appropriate, relevant international 

organizations to take measures and support programmes that are aimed at combating 

undernutrition in mothers, in particular during pregnancy, and in children, and the 

irreversible effects of chronic undernutrition in early childhood, in particular from 

birth to the age of 2 years; 

 12. Also calls upon all States and, where appropriate, relevant international 

organizations to implement policies and programmes to reduce and eliminate 

preventable mortality and morbidity, as a result of malnutrition, of children under 

5 years of age, and in this regard urges States to disseminate the technical guidance 

prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 

in collaboration with the World Health Organization,13 and to apply it, as appropriate, 

in the design, implementation, evaluation and monitoring of laws, policies, 

programmes, budgets and mechanisms for remedy and redress aimed at eliminating 

preventable mortality and morbidity of children under 5 years of age; 

 13. Encourages all States to take steps, with a view to progressively achieving 

the full realization of the right to food, including steps to promote the conditions for 

everyone to be free from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy fully the right to 

food, and to create and adopt national plans to combat hunger;  

 14. Recognizes the advances made through South-South cooperation in 

developing countries and regions in connection with food security and the 

development of agricultural production for the full realization of the right to food;  

 15. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and public 

investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in 

particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investment, 

including private investment, in appropriate small-scale irrigation and water 

management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts and to tackle 

water scarcity; 

 16. Recognizes the critical contribution made by the fisheries sector to the 

realization of the right to food and to food security and the contribution of small -scale 

fishers to the local food security of coastal communities;  

 17. Also recognizes that 70 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas, where 

nearly half a billion family farmers are located, and that these people are especially 

vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm 

incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing 

challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural 

policies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and 

insurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security 

and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing 

communities and local enterprises, including through the facilitation of access for 

their products to national and international markets and empowerment  of small 

producers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and 

the provision of the right to food;  

 18. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through 

national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and 

land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically 

appropriate to the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation

of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries 

Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; 14  

 19. Urges States that have not yet done so to favourably consider becoming 

parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity15 and to consider becoming parties 

to the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture 16 as 

a matter of priority; 

 20. Recognizes the important role of indigenous peoples and their traditional 

knowledge and seed supply systems, as well as the important role of new 

technologies, in the conservation of biodiversity and in aiming to ensure food security 

and improved nutrition; 

 21. Recalls the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 

Peoples,17 acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of 

indigenous peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concerns over the 

obstacles and challenges they face in achieving the full enjoyment of the right to food, 

and calls upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the 

disproportionately high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples 

and the continuous discrimination against them;  

 22. Also recalls the outcome document of the high-level plenary meeting of 

the General Assembly known as the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, held 

on 22 and 23 September 2014,18 and the commitment to developing, in conjunction 

with the indigenous peoples concerned and where appropriate, policies, programmes 

and resources to support indigenous peoples’ occupations, traditional subsistence 

activities, economies, livelihoods, food security and nutrition;  

 23. Notes the need to further examine various concepts, such as “food 

sovereignty”, and their relation to food security and the right to food, bearing in mind 

the need to avoid any negative impact on the enjoyment of the right to food for all 

people at all times; 

 24. Requests all States and private actors, as well as international 

organizations, within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to 

promote the effective realization of the right to food for all;  

 25. Recognizes the need to strengthen national commitment, as well as 

international assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with the affected 

countries, towards the full realization and protection of the right to food, and in 

particular to develop national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their 

homes and land because of hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting their 

enjoyment of the right to food; 

 26. Takes note with appreciation of the growing movement, in different 

regions of the world, towards the adoption of framework laws, national strategies and 

measures in support of the full realization of the right to food for all;  

 27. Stresses the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation 

and utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including 

external debt relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to 

implement sustainable food security policies;

international financial and development institutions, as well as the relevant United 

Nations agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the funding necessary to 

realize the right to food, as set out in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security, 

and to achieve the aims of Goal 2 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 4

 32. Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that 

all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet

assistance as an effective contribution to the expansion and improvement of 

agriculture and its environmental sustainability, food production, breeding projects 

on diversity of crops and livestock and institutional innovations such as community 

seed banks, farmer field schools and seed fairs, and to the provision of humanitarian 

food assistance in activities related to emergency situations for the realization of the 

right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that 

each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of 

national programmes and strategies in this regard;  

 35. Also stresses that States parties to the World Trade Organization

food; 

 36. Calls upon Member States, the United Nations system and other relevant

different regions, including Southern Africa; 

 37. Calls upon Member States, the United Nations, humanitarian and 

development organizations and other relevant actors to urgently and effectively 

respond to, prevent and prepare for rising global food insecurity affecting millions of

including by enhancing humanitarian and development cooperation and providing 



A/C.3/73/L.36/Rev.1 
 

 

18-19155 10/11

Member States aimed at the fulfilment of the right to food and to avoid any actions 

that could have a negative impact on its realization;  

 40. Takes note with appreciation of the interim report of the Special 

Rapporteur,19 which addresses the rights of agricultural workers on a global scale, 

with particular attention to the dangerous working conditions inherent in the 

agricultural sector, which not only threaten the lives of agricultural workers but also 

undermine their right to food;  

 41. Recognizes the importance of giving due consideration to the adverse 

impact of climate change and to the full realization of the right to food, recalls the 

Paris Agreement, adopted at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties 

to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Paris from 

30 November to 13 December 2015,20  and also recalls the holding of the twenty-

second session of the Conference of the Parties in Marrakech, Morocco, from 7 to 

18 November 2016; 

 42. Also recognizes the impact of climate change and of the El Niño 

phenomenon on agricultural production and food security around the world and the 

importance of designing and implementing actions to reduce its effects, in particular 

on vulnerable populations, such as rural women, bearing in mind the role that they 

play in supporting their households and communities in achieving food and nutrition 

security, generating income and improving rural livelihoods and overall well -being; 

 43. Reiterates its support for the realization of the mandate of the Special

comment No. 12 (1999) on the right to adequate food (article 11 of the International 

Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), 21  in which the Committee 

affirmed, inter alia, that the right to adequate food is indivisibly linked to the inherent 

dignity of the human person, indispensable for the fulfilment of other human rights 

enshrined in the International Bill of Human Rights and inseparable from social 

justice, requiring the adoption of appropriate economic, environmental and social 

policies, at both the national and the international levels, oriented to the eradication 

of poverty and the fulfilment of all human rights for all;
