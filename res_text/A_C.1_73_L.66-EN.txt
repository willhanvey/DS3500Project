 Reaffirming the conviction that, pending the total elimination of nuclear 

weapons, the establishment and maintenance of nuclear-weapon-free zones enhances 

global and regional peace and security, strengthens the nuclear non-proliferation 

regime and contributes towards realizing the objectives of nuclear disarmament,  

 Urging States that have not yet established nuclear-weapon-free-zone treaties to 

accelerate efforts in this direction, particularly in the Middle East, through 

agreements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned, in accordance 

with the provisions of the Final Document of the first special session of the General 

Assembly devoted to disarmament and the principles adopted by the Disarmament 

Commission in 1999,8

are encouraged to ratify the respective treaties that establish said zones,  

 Recalling also that it is expected that the States to which the protocols to the 

treaties that establish nuclear-weapon-free zones are open for signature ratify them 

and constructively consult and cooperate to bring about the entry into force of the 

protocols, 

 Noting that, among other aspects, those protocols include the necessary security 

guarantees for the States belonging to nuclear-weapon-free zones,

zones at the first, second and third Conferences of States Parties and Signatorie s to 

Treaties that Establish Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones, held in Mexico City from 26 to 

28 April 2005 and in New York on 30 April 2010 and 24 April 2015, respectively, at

promoting coordination and convergence in the implementation of the provisions of 

the treaties and in strengthening the regime of nuclear disarmament and 

non-proliferation;
