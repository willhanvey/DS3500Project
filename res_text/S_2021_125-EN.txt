 The Security Council,  

 Recalling its previous resolutions concerning Sudan, in particular 1591 (2005), 

1651 (2005), 1665 (2006), 1672 (2006), 1713 (2006), 1779 (2007), 1841 (2008), 1891 

(2009), 1945 (2010), 1982 (2011), 2035 (2012), 2091 (2013), 2138 (2014), 2200 

(2015), 2265 (2016), 2340 (2017), 2400 (2018), 2455 (2019), and 2508 (2020), and 

its Presidential Statement of 11 December 2018 (S/PRST/2018/19),  

 Welcoming the signing of the Juba Peace Agreement in Juba on 3 October 2020 

by the Government of Sudan, the Sudan Revolutionary Front and the Sudan 

Liberation Movement-Minni Minawi, and congratulating Sudan and its people for 

this historic achievement, which represents a significant opportunity for 

comprehensive and sustainable peace in Sudan and an important milestone of the 

transition period towards a peaceful, stable, democratic and prosperous future for 

Sudan,  

 Encouraging the signatories of the peace agreement to begin swiftly the process 

of implementation, and noting that the peace agreement provides for a specific role 

for the United Nations in supporting the implementation of its provisions,  

 Urging those who have yet to join the peace process with the Government of 

Sudan to do so immediately, constructively and without pre-conditions in order to 

conclude swiftly negotiations on a comprehensive peace agreement, and calling upon 

all international actors to continue encouraging non-participatory parties in this 

regard, 

 Reaffirming the primary responsibility of the Government of Sudan to protect 

civilians across its territory, acknowledging in this regard the Government of Sudan’s 

National Plan for Civilian Protection (S/2020/429) and the weapons-collection 

programme, and expressing concern that the security situation in some regions of 

Darfur remains precarious, and underscoring the need to avoid a relapse into conflict 

and mitigate the risks for the population posed inter alia by threats against civilians 

in Darfur, inter-communal violence, human rights violations and abuses, violations of 

international humanitarian law and continued displacement,   

 Stressing the need for the Government of Sudan to ensure accountability for 

violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law, and 

welcoming the provisions of the Constitutional Document on transitional justice and 

accountability measures in this regard,  

 Determining that the situation in Sudan continues to constitute a threat to 

international peace and security in the region,  

 Recalling the final report of the Sudan Panel of Experts (S/2021/40),
