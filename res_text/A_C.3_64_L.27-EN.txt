 Recalling the relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights and the 
Human Rights Council in this regard, 

 Welcoming the resolve expressed in the United Nations Millennium 
Declaration adopted by the General Assembly on 8 September 20006 to take 
measures to eliminate the increasing acts of racism and xenophobia in many 
societies and to promote greater harmony and tolerance in all societies, and looking 
forward to its effective implementation at all levels, 

 Underlining in this regard the importance of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference against Racism, Racial 
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, held in Durban, South Africa, 
in 2001,7 and the Outcome Document of the Durban Review Conference, held in 
Geneva in April 2009,8 and welcoming the progress achieved in implementing them, 
and emphasizing that they constitute a solid foundation for the elimination of all 
scourges and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance, 

 Expressing concern at the increase in racist violence and xenophobic ideas in 
many parts of the world, in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in 
society at large, as a result, inter alia, of the resurgence of activities of political 
parties and associations established on the basis of racist, xenophobic and 
ideological superiority platforms and charters, and the persistent use of those 
platforms and charters to promote or incite racist ideologies, 

 Deeply alarmed at the rising trends towards discrimination based on religion 
or belief, including in some national policies, laws and administrative measures that 
stigmatize groups of people belonging to certain religions and beliefs under a 
variety of pretexts relating to security and irregular immigration, thereby 
legitimizing discrimination against them, and consequently impairing their 
enjoyment of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and impeding 
their ability to observe, practise and manifest their religion freely and without fear 
of coercion, violence or reprisal, 

 Noting with deep concern the serious instances of intolerance, discrimination 
and acts of violence based on religion or belief, intimidation and coercion motivated 
by extremism, religious or otherwise, occurring in many parts of the world, in 
addition to the negative projection of certain religions in the media and the 
introduction and enforcement of laws and administrative measures that specifically 
discriminate against and target persons with certain ethnic and religious 
backgrounds, particularly Muslim minorities following the events of 11 September 
2001, and that threaten to impede their full enjoyment of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, 

 Stressing that the defamation of religions is a serious affront to human dignity 
leading to the illicit restriction of the freedom of religion of their adherents and 
incitement to religious hatred and violence, 

 Stressing also the need to effectively combat defamation of all religions, and 
incitement to religious hatred in general,

 Reaffirming that discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief constitutes 
a violation of human rights and a disavowal of the principles of the Charter, 

 Noting with concern that the defamation of religions, and incitement to 
religious hatred in general, could lead to social disharmony and violations of human 
rights, and alarmed at the inaction of some States to combat this burgeoning trend 
and the resulting discriminatory practices against adherents of certain religions, 

 Taking note of the reports of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance submitted to the 
Human Rights Council at its fourth, sixth, ninth and twelfth9 sessions, in which the 
Special Rapporteur highlighted the serious nature of the defamation of all religions 
and the need to complement legal strategies, and reiterating the call of the Special 
Rapporteur to all States to wage a systematic campaign against incitement to racial 
and religious hatred by maintaining a careful balance between the defence of 
secularism and respect for freedom of religion and by acknowledging and respecting 
the complementarity of all the freedoms embodied in internationally agreed human 
rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights,2 

 Recalling the proclamation of the Global Agenda for Dialogue among 
Civilizations,10 and inviting States, the organizations and bodies of the United 
Nations system, within existing resources, other international and regional 
organizations and civil society to contribute to the implementation of the 
Programme of Action contained in the Global Agenda, 

 Welcoming the efforts of the Alliance of Civilizations initiative in promoting 
mutual respect and understanding among different cultures and societies, including 
the second forum of the Alliance, held in Istanbul, Turkey, on 6 and 7 April 2009, its 
third forum, to be held in Brazil in 2010, and its fourth forum, to be held in Qatar 
in 2011, 

 Recognizing the valuable contributions of all religions and beliefs to modern 
civilization and the contribution that dialogue among civilizations can make to an 
improved awareness and understanding of common values, 

 Convinced that respect for cultural, ethnic, religious and linguistic diversity, as 
well as dialogue among and within civilizations, are essential for peace, 
understanding and friendship among individuals and people of the different cultures 
and nations of the world, while manifestations of cultural prejudice, intolerance and 
xenophobia towards people belonging to different cultures, religions and beliefs 
give rise to polarization and disturb social cohesion, generating hatred and violence 
among peoples and nations throughout the world, 

 Underlining the important role of education in the promotion of tolerance, 
which involves acceptance by the public of, and its respect for, diversity, including 
with regard to religious expressions, and underlining also the fact that education 
should contribute in a meaningful way to promoting tolerance and the elimination of 
discrimination based on religion or belief,

 Reaffirming the need for all States to continue their national and international 
efforts to enhance dialogue and broaden understanding among civilizations, 
cultures, religions and beliefs, and emphasizing that States, regional organizations, 
non-governmental organizations, religious bodies and the media have an important 
role to play in promoting tolerance, respect for and freedom of religion and belief, 

 Welcoming all international and regional initiatives aimed at promoting cross-
cultural and interfaith harmony, including the international dialogue on interfaith 
cooperation, the World Conference on Dialogue, held in Madrid from 16 to 18 July 
2008, and the High-level meeting of the General Assembly on the culture of peace, 
held on 12 and 13 November 2008, and their valuable efforts towards the promotion 
of a culture of peace and dialogue at all levels, and taking note with appreciation of 
the programmes led by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization in this regard, 

 Underlining the importance of increasing contacts at all levels in order to 
deepen dialogue and reinforce understanding among different cultures, religions, 
beliefs and civilizations, and in this regard taking note with appreciation of the 
Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the Ministerial Meeting on 
Human Rights and Cultural Diversity of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, 
held in Tehran on 3 and 4 September 2007,11 

 Recognizing the importance of the interface between religion and race, and 
that instances can arise of multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination on the 
basis of religion and other grounds such as race, colour, descent, or national or 
ethnic origin,12 

 Recalling its resolution 63/171 of 18 December 2008, 

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General13 and the conclusions 
contained therein;

manifestations of intolerance and discrimination in matters of religion or belief still 
evident in the world; 

 3. Strongly deplores all acts of psychological and physical violence and 
assaults, and incitement thereto, against persons on the basis of their religion or 
belief, and such acts directed against their businesses, properties, cultural centres

religions; 

 4. Expresses deep concern at the programmes and agendas pursued by 
extremist organizations and groups aimed at creating and perpetuating stereotypes 
about certain religions, in particular when condoned by Governments; 

 5. Notes with deep concern the intensification of the overall campaign of 
the defamation of religions, and incitement to religious hatred in general, including

the ethnic and religious profiling of Muslim minorities in the aftermath of the tragic 
events of 11 September 2001; 

 6. Recognizes that, in the context of the fight against terrorism, defamation 
of religions and incitement to religious hatred in general become aggravating factors 
that contribute to the denial of fundamental rights and freedoms of members of

 7. Expresses deep concern in this respect that Islam is frequently and 
wrongly associated with human rights violations and terrorism; 

 8. Reiterates the commitment of all States to the implementation, in an 
integrated manner, of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, which 
was adopted without a vote by the General Assembly on 8 September 200614 and 
reaffirmed by the Assembly in its resolution 62/272 of 5 September 2008, and which 
clearly confirms, inter alia, that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with 
any religion, nationality, civilization or ethnic group, stressing the need to reinforce 
the international community’s commitment to promote a culture of peace, justice 
and human development, ethnic, national and religious tolerance, and respect for all 
religions, religious values, beliefs or cultures and prevent the defamation of 
religions; 

 9. Deplores the use of the print, audio-visual and electronic media, 
including the Internet, and any other means to incite acts of violence, xenophobia or 
related intolerance and discrimination against any religion, as well as targeting of 
religious symbols; 

 10. Emphasizes that, as stipulated in international human rights law, 
everyone has the right to hold opinions without interference, and has the right to 
freedom of expression, the exercise of which carries with it special duties and 
responsibilities and may therefore be subject to limitations as are provided for by 
law and are necessary for respect of the rights or reputations of others, protection of 
national security or of public order, public health or morals; 

 11. Reaffirms that general recommendation XV (42) of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination,15 in which the Committee stipulated that the 
prohibition of the dissemination of all ideas based upon racial superiority or hatred 
is compatible with freedom of opinion and expression, is equally applicable to the 
question of incitement to religious hatred; 

 12. Strongly condemns all manifestations and acts of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance against national or ethnic, 
religious and linguistic minorities and migrants and the stereotypes often applied to 
them, including on the basis of religion or belief, and urges all States to apply and, 
where applicable, reinforce existing laws when such xenophobic or intolerant acts, 
manifestations or expressions occur, in order to eradicate impunity for those who 
commit xenophobic and racist acts; 

 13. Reaffirms the obligation of all States to enact the necessary legislation to 
prohibit the advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes 
incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, and encourages States, in their

to religious hatred in general, by strategizing and harmonizing actions at the local, 
national, regional and international levels through education and awareness-raising, 
and urges all States to ensure equal access to education for all, in law and in 
practice, including access to free primary education for all children, both girls and

 20. Calls upon all States to exert the utmost efforts, in accordance with their

vulnerable to desecration or destruction; 

 21. Also calls upon the international community to foster a global dialogue to 
promote a culture of tolerance and peace at all levels, based on respect for human 
rights and diversity of religion and belief, and urges States, non-governmental 
organizations, religious leaders and bodies and the print and electronic media to 
support and foster such a dialogue; 

 22. Affirms that the Human Rights Council shall promote universal respect 
for all religious and cultural values and address instances of intolerance,

discrimination and incitement of hatred against members of any community or 
adherents of any religion, as well as the means to consolidate international efforts in 
order to combat impunity for such deplorable acts; 

 23. Welcomes the initiative by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights on the expert seminar on freedom of expression and advocacy of 
religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, 
on 2 and 3 October 2008, and requests the High Commissioner to continue to build 
on this initiative, with a view to concretely contributing to the prevention and 
elimination of all such forms of incitement and the consequences of negative 
stereotyping of religions or beliefs, and their adherents, on the human rights of those 
individuals and their communities; 

 24. Takes note of the efforts of the High Commissioner to promote and 
include human rights aspects in educational programmes, particularly the World

efforts, with particular focus on:
