Review and implementation of the Concluding Document of 

the Twelfth Special Session of the General Assembly: 

Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons  
 

 

 

  Angola, Bhutan, Cuba, Honduras, India, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, 

Myanmar, Nepal, Samoa and Viet Nam: draft resolution 
 

 

  Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Convinced that the use of nuclear weapons poses the most serious threat to the 

survival of humankind, 

 Bearing in mind the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 

8 July 1996 on the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons, 1  

 Convinced that a multilateral, universal and binding agreement prohibiting the 

use or threat of use of nuclear weapons would contribute to the elimination of the 

nuclear threat and to the climate for negotiations leading to the ultimate elimination 

of nuclear weapons, thereby strengthening international peace and security, 

 Conscious that some steps have been taken by the Russian Federation and the 

United States of America towards a reduction of their nuclear weapons and that 

further steps — in all relevant formats — on nuclear arms control and disarmament 

can contribute to the improvement of the international climate and the goal of the 

complete elimination of nuclear weapons,  

 Recalling that in paragraph 58 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special 

Session of the General Assembly2 it is stated that all States should actively participate 

in efforts to bring about conditions in international relations among States in which a 

code of peaceful conduct of nations in international affairs could be agreed upon and 

which would preclude the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, 

 Reaffirming that any use of nuclear weapons would be a violation of the Charter 

of the United Nations and a crime against humanity, as declared in its resolutions

1653 (XVI) of 24 November 1961, 33/71 B of 14 December 1978, 34/83 G of 

11 December 1979, 35/152 D of 12 December 1980 and 36/92 I of 9 December 1981, 

 Recognizing that a legally binding prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons is 

not contrary to but in fact contributes to international efforts for the achievement and 

maintenance of a world free of nuclear weapons, 

 Stressing that an international convention on the prohibition of the use of 

nuclear weapons would be an important step in a phased programme towards the 

complete elimination of nuclear weapons, with a specified framework of time, 

 Noting with regret that the Conference on Disarmament, during its 2017 session, 

was unable to undertake negotiations on this subject as called for in General Assembly 

resolution 72/59 of 4 December 2017, 

 1. Reiterates its request to the Conference on Disarmament to commence 

negotiations in order to reach agreement on an international convention prohibiting 

the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances; 

 2. Requests the Conference on Disarmament to report to the General 

Assembly on the results of those negotiations.
