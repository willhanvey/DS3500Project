aspects under strict and effective international control,  

 Acknowledging the significant contribution made towards realizing the 

objectives of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, pending the total 

elimination of nuclear weapons, through the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free 

zones, although they are not an end in themselves, and reaffirming the political 

decision of 115 States parties to the treaties that establish nuclear-weapon-free zones 

and Mongolia to reject nuclear weapons,  

 Marking the fifteenth anniversary of the signing the Treaty on a Nuclear-

Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia and the thirtieth anniversary of the closure of the
