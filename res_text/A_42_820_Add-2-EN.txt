nations, in paLticular for developing countries,

in the contoHt of sooial and eoonomio development,

Noting with appreciation the important oontributi~n made by the World
Commission on Environment·and Development, 20! which oalls for new national
and international approaches in dealing wit~the various faotors affecting the

Considering that natural diuasters, suoh as those caused by earthquakes,
windstorms (cyclones, hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons), tsunamis, floods,
landslides, volcanio eruptions, wildfires and other oalamities of natural
origin, have claimed about 3 million lives worldwide in the past two deoades,
adversely affected the lives of at least 800 million more people and tosulted
in immed late damages exceeding $~3 bllUuil,

Considering also that, among disasters of natural origin, drought and
desertiflcaUon are res\lltir.g in enormous damage, part1Clularl~' in Africa,
where the reoent drought threatened the lives of more than 20 million people
and upruoted millions of others,

Reooqnizing that the effects of such disasters may damage very severely
the fragile economic inf1'8struct'!re of developing countrios, eapeoially the
least developed, land-locked and island developing countties, and thus hamper
their development process,

life, property damage and social and economic disruption caused by natural
disasters, such as earthquakes, windstorms (cyclones, hurricanfts, tornadoes,
typhoons), tsunamis, flooda, landalides, volcanic eruptions, wildfiree and
other oalamities of natural origin, such as grasshopper and locust
infestations, and that its goals are,

6. Recommends that, if necessary, extrabudgetary resources be provided
