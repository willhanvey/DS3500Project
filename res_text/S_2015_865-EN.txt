(2015/18), 

 Expressing its deep concern about the ongoing escalation of insecurity and the 

continued rise in violence in Burundi, as well as the persisting political impasse in 

the country, marked by a lack of dialogue among Burundian stakeholders,  

 Stressing that the situation prevailing in Burundi has the potential to seriously 

undermine the significant gains achieved through the Arusha Agreement, with 

devastating consequences for Burundi and the region as a whole,  

 Stressing the primary responsibility of the Government of Burundi for 

ensuring security in its territory and protecting its population with re spect for the 

rule of law, human rights and international humanitarian law, as applicable,  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, political independence, 

territorial integrity and unity of Burundi,

abuses, including those involving extra-judicial killings, acts of torture and other 

cruel, inhuman and/or degrading treatment, arbitrary arrests, illegal detentions, 

harassment and intimidation of human rights defenders and journalists, and all 

violations and abuses of human rights committed in Burundi both by security forces 

and by militias and other illegal armed groups,  

 Underscoring its deep concerns on the prevalence of impunity, on the daily 

assassinations, on the restrictions on enjoyment of the freedom of expression, 

including for members of the press, and on the continued worsening of the 

humanitarian situation, marked by the more than 200 000 Burundian citizens 

seeking refuge in neighbouring countries, and commending the host countries for 

their efforts, 

 Strongly condemning all public statements, coming from in or outside of the 

country, that appear aimed at inciting violence or hatred towards different groups in

those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law or violations and 

abuses of human rights, as applicable,

 Welcoming the deployment of African Union human rights observers and 

military experts and urging the Government of Burundi and other stakeholders to 

provide them full cooperation in order to facilitate the implementation of their 

mandate, 

 Noting the decision of the African Union to impose targeted sanctions, 

including travel ban and asset freeze, against all the Burundian stakeholders whose 

actions and statements contribute to the perpetuation of violence and impede the
