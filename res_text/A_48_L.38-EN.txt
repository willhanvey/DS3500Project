Conscious that the success of national liberation struggles and the
resultant international situation have provided the international community with
a unique opportunity to make a decisive contribution towards the elimination of
colonialism in all its forms and manifestations,

Noting with satisfaction the achievements of the Special Committee in
contributing to the effective and complete implementation of the Declaration and
other relevant resolutions of the United Nations on decolonization,

Stressing the importance of the participation of the administering Powers
in the work of the Special Committee,

Noting also with satisfaction the cooperation and active participation of
some administering Powers in the work of the Special Committee, as well as their
continued readiness to receive United Nations visiting missions in the
Territories under their administration,

Noting with concern the negative impact which the non-participation of
certain administering Powers has had on the work of the Special Committee,
depriving it of an important source of information on the Territories under
their administration,

Aware of the pressing need of newly independent and emerging States for
assistance from the United Nations and its system of organizations in the
economic, social and other fields,

social and other assistance from the United Nations and the organizations within
its system,

decolonization, including its resolution 43/47, in which it declared the decade
that began in 1990 as the International Decade for the Eradication of
Colonialism, and calls upon the administering Powers, in accordance with those
resolutions, to take all necessary steps to enable the peoples of the
Territories concerned to exercise fully as soon as possible their right to
self-determination and independence;

2. Affirms once again that the continuation of colonialism in any form or
manifestation - including racism and economic exploitation - is incompatible
with the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights 2/ and the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples;

3. Reaffirms its determination to continue to take all steps necessary to
bring about the complete and speedy eradication of colonialism and the faithful

system, to give effect within their respective spheres of competence to the
recommendations of the Special Committee for the implementation of the
Declaration and other relevant resolutions of the United Nations;

7. Calls upon the administering Powers to ensure that no activity of

their right to self-determination and independence;

in the Territories under their administration and to eliminate military bases

interference against other States;

9. Urges all States, directly and through their action in the specialized
agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, to provide moral
and material assistance to the peoples of colonial Territories, and requests
that the administering Powers, in consultation with the Governments of the
Territories under their administration, take steps to enlist and make effective
use of all possible assistance, on both a bilateral and a multilateral basis, in
the strengthening of the economies of those Territories;

10. Requests the Special Committee to continue to seek suitable means for
the immediate and full implementation of the Declaration and to carry out those
actions approved by the General Assembly regarding the International Decade for
the Eradication of Colonialism in all Territories that have not yet exercised
their right to self-determination and independence and, in particular:
