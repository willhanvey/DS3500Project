intervention, aggression and occupation, adopted by the Commission on Human
Rights at its fifty-ninth2 and previous sessions,

Reaffirming its previous resolutions on the universal realization of the right of
peoples to self-determination, including resolution 57/197 of 18 December 2002,

Reaffirming also its resolution 55/2 of 8 September 2000, containing the
United Nations Millennium Declaration, which, inter alia, upholds the right to self-
determination of peoples under colonial domination and foreign occupation,

Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on the right of peoples to
self-determination,3

1. Reaffirms that the universal realization of the right of all peoples,
including those under colonial, foreign and alien domination, to self-determination
is a fundamental condition for the effective guarantee and observance of human
rights and for the preservation and promotion of such rights;

2. Declares its firm opposition to acts of foreign military intervention,
aggression and occupation, since these have resulted in the suppression of the right
of peoples to self-determination and other human rights in certain parts of the world;

3. Calls upon those States responsible to cease immediately their military
intervention in and occupation of foreign countries and territories and all acts of
repression, discrimination, exploitation and maltreatment, in particular the brutal
and inhuman methods reportedly employed for the execution of those acts against
the peoples concerned;

4. Deplores the plight of millions of refugees and displaced persons who
have been uprooted as a result of the aforementioned acts, and reaffirms their right
to return to their homes voluntarily in safety and honour;

5. Requests the Commission on Human Rights to continue to give special
attention to the violation of human rights, especially the right to self-determination,
resulting from foreign military intervention, aggression or occupation;

6. Requests the Secretary-General to report on this question to the General
Assembly at its fifty-ninth session under the item entitled “Right of peoples to self-
determination”.
