General and complete disarmament 

 
 
 

  Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria and Switzerland: draft resolution 
 
 

  Decreasing the operational readiness of nuclear weapons systems 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 62/36 of 5 December 2007 and 63/41 of 2 December 
2008,  

 Recalling also that the maintenance of nuclear weapons on high alert was a 
feature of cold war nuclear postures, and welcoming the increased confidence and 
transparency since the cessation of the cold war, 

 Concerned that, notwithstanding the end of the cold war, several thousand 
nuclear weapons remain on high alert, ready to be launched within minutes, 

 Noting the continuing engagement in multilateral disarmament forums in 
support of further reductions to the operational status of nuclear weapons systems, 

 Recognizing that the maintenance of nuclear weapons systems at a high level 
of readiness increases the risk of the unintentional or accidental use of such 
weapons, which would have catastrophic consequences, 

 Recognizing also that reductions in deployments and the lowering of 
operational status contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security, 
as well as to the process of nuclear disarmament, through the enhancement of 
confidence-building and transparency measures and a diminishing role for nuclear 
weapons in security policies, 

 Welcoming the steps taken by some States to enhance the environment to 
support further reductions in nuclear weapons, including de-targeting initiatives and 
increasing the amount of preparation time required for deployment, and in this 
connection, welcoming the commitment made by the United States to maximize 
Presidential decision time and to consider other steps that may diminish further the 
possibility of nuclear launches resulting from accidents, unauthorized actions, or 
misperceptions,  



A/C.1/65/L.42  
 

10-58719 2 
 

 1. Welcomes the adoption by consensus of the conclusions and 
recommendations for follow-on actions of the 2010 Review Conference of the 
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,1 including the 
commitments of the nuclear-weapon States to promptly engage with a view to, inter 
alia, considering the legitimate interest of non-nuclear-weapon States in further 
reducing the operational status of nuclear weapons systems in ways that promote 
international stability and security, and looks forward to the report of the nuclear-
weapon States, in terms of that undertaking, to the Preparatory Committee of the 
Review Conference in 2014;  

 2. Calls for further practical steps to be taken to decrease the operational 
readiness of nuclear weapons systems, with a view to ensuring that all nuclear 
weapons are removed from high alert status;  

 3. Urges States to update the General Assembly on progress made in the 
implementation of the present resolution; 

 4. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
