  Germany and United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 

Ireland: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council,  

 Recalling the arms embargo, travel ban, assets freeze and measures concerning 

illicit oil exports which were imposed and modified by resolutions 1970 (2011) and 

2146 (2014), and modified by subsequent resolutions including, 2441 (2018) and 

2473 (2019), and that the mandate of the Panel of Experts established by paragraph 

24 of resolution 1973 (2011) and modified by subsequent resolutions was extended 

until 15 February 2020 by resolution 2441 (2018),  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial 

integrity and national unity of Libya,  

 Reiterating its request that all Member States support fully the efforts of the 

Special Representative of the Secretary-General, and its call on Member States to use 

their influence with the parties to bring about a ceasefire and a Libyan-led and Libyan-

owned inclusive political process,  

 Underscoring the importance of ensuring that existing measures are fully 

implemented and that violations are reported to the United Nations Sanctions 

Committee, and recalling in that regard that individuals or entities engaging in, or 

providing support for, acts that threaten the peace, stability or security of Libya may 

be designated for targeted sanctions,  

 Reaffirming that all parties must comply with their obligations under 

international humanitarian law and international human rights law, as applicable, and 

emphasising the importance of holding accountable those responsible for violations 

or abuses of human rights or violations of international humanitarian law, including 

those involved in attacks targeting civilians,  

 Expressing its concern that the illicit export of petroleum, including crude oil 

and refined petroleum products, from Libya undermines the Government of National 

Accord (GNA) and National Oil Corporation and poses a threat to the peace, security 

and stability of Libya, and noting with concern the reports of the illicit import of 

petroleum, including crude oil and refined petroleum products to Libya,  

 Recalling that providing support for armed groups or criminal networks through 

the illicit exploitation of crude oil or any other natural resources in Libya may 

constitute acts that threaten the peace, stability and security of Libya,  

 Further reiterating its concern about activities which could damage the integrity 

and unity of Libyan State financial institutions and the National Oil Corporation

(NOC), and stressing the need for the Government of National Accord to exercise 

sole and effective oversight over the National Oil Corporation, the Central Bank of 

Libya, and the Libyan Investment Authority as a matter of urgency, without prejudice 

to future constitutional arrangements pursuant to the Libyan Political Agreement,  

 Recalling resolution 2259 (2015) which called on Member States to cease 

support to and official contact with parallel institutions outside of the Libyan Political 

Agreement, as stipulated therein,  

 Recalling that international law, as reflected in the United Nations Convention 

on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982, sets out the legal framework applicable 

to activities in the oceans and seas,  

 Further recalling resolutions 2292 (2016), 2357 (2017), 2420 (2018) and 2473 

(2019) which in relation to the implementation of the arms embargo authorise, for the 

period of time specified by those resolutions, the inspection on the high seas off the 

coast of Libya of vessels bound to or from Libya believed to be carrying arms or 

related materiel in violation of relevant Security Council resolutions, and the seizure 

and disposal of such items provided that Member States make good faith efforts to 

first obtain the consent of the vessel’s flag State prior to any inspections while acting 

in accordance with those resolutions,  

 Determining that the situation in Libya continues to constitute a threat to 

international peace and security,  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 

  Prevention of Illicit Exports of Petroleum, including Crude Oil and Refined 

Petroleum Products

the measures imposed by resolution 2146 (2014), as amended by paragraph 2 of

resolution 2146 (2014) to be one year, which may be renewed by the Committee;  

 3. Welcomes the appointment by the Government of National Accord and 

notification to the Committee established pursuant to paragraph 24 of resolution 1970 

(2011) (the Committee) of a focal point responsible for communication with the 

Committee with respect to the measures in resolution 2146 (2014), reiterates its 

request that the focal point inform the Committee of any vessels transporting 

petroleum, including crude oil and refined petroleum products, illicitly exported from 

Libya, and urges the Government of National Accord to work closely with the 

National Oil Company in that regard, and to provide regular updates to inform the 

Committee on ports, oil fields, and installations that are under its control, and to 

inform the Committee about the mechanism used to certify legal exports of petroleum, 

including crude oil and refined petroleum products, and requests that the Panel of 

Experts closely follow and report to the Committee any information relating to the 

illicit export from or illicit import to Libya of petroleum, including crude oil and 

refined petroleum products;  

 4. Calls on the Government of National Accord, on the basis of any 

information regarding such exports or attempted exports, to expeditiously contact the 

concerned vessel’s flag State, in the first instance, to resolve the issue and directs the 

Committee to immediately inform all relevant Member States about notifications to 

the Committee from the Government of National Accord’s focal point regarding
