building upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seeking 

to address their unfinished business,  

 Reaffirming also its resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015 on the Addis Ababa 

Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, 

which is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, supports

concrete policies and actions, and reaffirms the strong political commitment to 

address the challenge of financing and creating an enabling environment at all levels 

for sustainable development in the spirit of global partnership and solidarity,  

 Reaffirming further the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, 

adopted at the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly on addressing

Development Goals by designing sustainable and inclusive recovery strategies to 

accelerate progress towards the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda and to help 

to reduce the risk of future shocks, and recognizing that the COVID-19 pandemic 

requires a global response based on unity, solidarity and renewed multilateral 

cooperation, 

 Recognizing the importance to cooperate internationally to ensure safe, orderly 

and regular migration, recognizing further the positive contributions of migrants to 

inclusive growth and sustainable development in their countries of origin, transit and 

destination, and to the response and recovery to the crisis caused by COVID -19, at 

the same time noting with concern that migrants are often among those in vulnerable 

situations to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of a variety of factors 

including living and working conditions, migration status, limited local knowledge 

and networks, level of inclusion in countries of destination, and xenophobia against 

them, emphasizing that, in many countries, migrants make up a substantial share of 

the workforce in key sectors that have remained open and active throughout the crisis, 

while also being overrepresented in some sectors hardest hit by the pandemic, pushing 

them to underemployment and unemployment, also noting with concern that the 

measures implemented to stop the spread of the virus, such as lockdowns and site 

closures, have at times worsened the living conditions of migrants, and that border 

closures have also put pressure on job security, further noting with concern that 

COVID-19 has emerged as a unique threat to remittances, as the effects of the 

pandemic on sustainable development have deprived many migrant workers of their 

main source of income, thus harming the ability of remittance-receiving families to 

meet basic needs, and, while taking into account the rights, obligations and 

expectations of countries of origin, countries of destination and migrant health 

personnel, noting with concern that highly trained and skilled health personnel from 

the developing countries continue to emigrate at an increasing rate to certain 

countries, which weakens health systems in the countries of origin,  

 Reaffirming the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,11 recalling the 

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 12 the International Covenant on 

Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,13 the International Convention on the 

Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,14 the Convention on the 

Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 15 the Convention on the 

Rights of the Child16 and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 17 

and recalling also the Declaration on the Right to Development,18  

 Encouraging States that have not done so to consider ratifying or acceding to 

the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers 

and Members of Their Families19 and to consider acceding to relevant conventions of 

the International Labour Organization, as appropriate,  

 Recalling the importance of the decent work agenda of the International Labour 

Organization, including for migrant workers, the eight fundamental Conventions of 

that Organization and the Global Jobs Pact adopted by the International Labour 

Conference at its ninety-eighth session as a general framework within which each

country can formulate policy packages specific to its situation and national priorities 

in order to promote a job-intensive recovery and sustainable development,  

 Recognizing the valuable contribution of the Global Forum on Migration and 

Development to addressing the multidimensional nature of international migration 

and promoting balanced and comprehensive approaches and dialogue on mig ration 

and development, and acknowledging that it has proved to be a valuable forum for 

holding frank and open discussions, including through multi-stakeholder dialogues, 

and that it has helped to build trust among participating stakeholders through the 

exchange of experiences and good practices and by virtue of its voluntary, 

intergovernmental, non-binding and informal character and the engagement of civil 

society actors as well as the private sector,  

 Acknowledging the important and complex interrelationship between international 

migration and development and the need to deal with the challenges and opportunities 

that migration presents to countries of origin, transit and destination, recognizing that 

migration brings benefits and challenges to the global community, and confirming the 

importance of including the matter in relevant debates and discussions held at the 

global, regional and national levels, as appropriate, including at the level of the United

migrants in the COVID-19 pandemic response and recovery efforts, in the spirit of 

international cooperation and in line with national policies, legislation and 

circumstances, based on shared responsibilities, including the obligation of States to 

readmit their own nationals, cognizant of the vulnerable situations of migrants and 

their contributions to the COVID-19 crisis response and recovery efforts, by, among 

others, ensuring full respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all 

migrants, regardless of their migration status, promoting faster, safer and cheaper 

transfer of remittances by further developing existing conducive policy and 

regulatory environments that enable competition, regulation and innovation on the 

remittance market, providing gender-responsive programmes and instruments that 

enhance the financial inclusion of migrants and their families in order to end structural 

barriers to women’s equal access to economic resources, by 2030, reducing to less 

than 3 per cent the transaction costs of migrant remittances and strengthening 

bilateral, subregional, regional, interregional and multilateral cooperation to support 

the protection, well-being and effective and sustainable reintegration into labour 

markets of migrant workers in line with national policies, and in this regard 

recognizes the role of the United Nations Network on Migration, and the International 

Organization for Migration as its coordinator; 

 4. Recommits to ensuring full respect for the human rights and fundamental 

freedoms of all migrants, regardless of their migration status, and supporting 

countries of origin, transit and destination in the spirit of international cooperation, 

taking into account national circumstances;  

 5. Recalls the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, 

adopted at the Intergovernmental Conference to Adopt the Global Compact for Safe,

the first intergovernmentally negotiated outcome, prepared under the auspices of the 

United Nations, to cover international migration in all its dimensions;  

 7. Recognizes that the High-level Dialogues on International Migration and 

Development have served as forums to advance discussions on the multidimensional 

aspects of international migration and development in order to identify appropriate 

ways and means to maximize its development benefits and minimize its negative 

impacts;  

 8. Notes that, with the adoption of the Global Compact, the High-level 

Dialogue on International Migration and Development has been repurposed into the 

International Migration Review Forum, which will serve as the primary 

intergovernmental global platform for Member States to discuss and share progres s 

on the implementation of all aspects of the Global Compact, including as it relates to

forum on sustainable development, which reviewed the Goals and targets relevant to 

migration of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, taking into consideration 

the outcomes of other processes related to international migration and development;  

 10. Welcomes the decision of the Secretary-General to establish the United 

Nations Network on Migration;
