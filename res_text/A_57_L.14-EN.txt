Reaffirming that the Agency is the competent authority responsible for
verifying and assuring, in accordance with the statute and the safeguards system of
the Agency, compliance with its safeguards agreements with States parties
undertaken in fulfilment of their obligations under article III, paragraph 1, of the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, with a view to preventing
diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or other nuclear
explosive devices, and also reaffirming that nothing should be done to undermine
the authority of the Agency in this regard and that States parties that have concerns
regarding non-compliance with the safeguards agreement of the Treaty by the States
parties should direct such concerns, along with supporting evidence and
information, to the Agency to consider, investigate, draw conclusions and decide on
necessary actions in accordance with its mandate,

Stressing the need for the highest standards of safety in the design and
operation of nuclear installations and in peaceful nuclear activities so as to minimize
risks to life, health and the environment, and recognizing that a good safety record
relies on good technology, good regulatory practices and well-qualified and trained
staff, as well as international cooperation,

Noting that a demonstrated global record of safety is a key element for the
peaceful uses of nuclear energy and that continuous efforts are necessary to ensure
that the human and technical elements of safety are maintained at the optimal level,
and also noting that, although safety is a national responsibility, international
cooperation on safety-related matters is indispensable,

Considering that an expansion of technical cooperation activities relating to
the peaceful uses of nuclear energy will contribute to the well-being of the peoples
of the world, recognizing the special needs of the developing countries for technical
assistance from the Agency and the importance of funding in order to benefit
effectively from the transfer and application of nuclear technology for peaceful
purposes as well as from the contribution of nuclear energy to their economic
development, and desiring that the resources of the Agency for technical
cooperation activities be assured, predictable and sufficient to meet the objectives
mandated in article II of its statute,

Conscious that the work done by the Agency in the field of nuclear sciences
and applications in the non-power sector contributes to sustainable development,

resolutions relating to Iraq,3 of his report to the Security Council dated 10 April
2002,4 of resolution GC(46)/RES/15 of 20 September 2002 of the General
Conference,5 noting with increasing concern that three and a half years have passed
since the Agency has been able to implement its mandate in Iraq, and that the longer
the suspension of Security Council resolution-related inspections in Iraq lasts, the
more difficult it will be to re-establish a level of knowledge of the status of Iraq’s
nuclear-related assets comparable to that achieved at the end of 1998, and also
noting the announced decision of the Iraqi Government to let the weapons inspectors
return to Iraq without conditions,

Taking note also of resolution GC(46)/RES/14 in connection with the
implementation of the Agreement between the Government of the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency for the
application of safeguards in connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons,6 noting with serious concern both the lack of tangible progress
reflected in the report of the Director General contained in document GC(46)/16 and
the fact that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has still not allowed the
Agency to implement its comprehensive safeguards agreement in connection with
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons with the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea, noting ongoing political developments in north-east
Asia and expressing the hope that they may contribute to progress towards full
