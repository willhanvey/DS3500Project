  The arms trade treaty 
 
 

 The General Assembly,  

 Guided by the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United 
Nations, and reaffirming its respect for and commitment to international law,  

 Recalling its resolutions 46/36 L of 9 December 1991, 51/45 N of  
10 December 1996, 51/47 B of 10 December 1996, 56/24 V of 24 December 2001, 
60/69 and 60/82 of 8 December 2005, 61/89 of 6 December 2006 and 63/240 of  
24 December 2008, 

 Recognizing that arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation are essential 
for the maintenance of international peace and security,  

 Reaffirming the inherent right of all States to individual or collective self-
defence in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter,  

 Recalling the commitment to the principles of political independence, 
sovereign equality and territorial integrity of all States, and acknowledging that 
peace and security, development and human rights are the foundations for collective 
security,  

 Acknowledging the right of all States to manufacture, import, export, transfer 
and retain conventional arms for self-defence and security needs and in order to 
participate in peace support operations,  

 Acknowledging also the right of States to regulate internal transfers of arms 
and national ownership, including through national constitutional protections on 
private ownership, exclusively within their territory,  



A/C.1/64/L.38/Rev.1  
 

09-58107 2 
 

 Recalling the obligations of all States to fully comply with arms embargoes 
decided by the Security Council in accordance with the Charter,  

 Reaffirming its respect for international law, including international human 
rights law and international humanitarian law, and the rights and responsibilities of 
every State under the Charter,  

 Taking note of and encouraging relevant initiatives, undertaken at the 
international, regional and subregional levels between States, including those of the 
United Nations,  

 Taking note also of the role played by non-governmental organizations and 
civil society to enhance cooperation, improve information exchange and 
transparency and assist States in implementing confidence-building measures in the 
field of responsible arms trade,  

 Recognizing that the absence of commonly agreed international standards for 
the transfer of conventional arms to address, inter alia, the problems relating to the 
unregulated trade of conventional arms and their diversion to the illicit market is a 
contributory factor to armed conflict, the displacement of people, organized crime 
and terrorism, thereby undermining peace, reconciliation, safety, security, stability 
and sustainable social and economic development,  

 Acknowledging the growing support across all regions for concluding a legally 
binding instrument negotiated on a non-discriminatory, transparent and multilateral 
basis, to establish the highest possible common international standards for the 
import, export and transfer of conventional arms, including through several regional 
and subregional workshops and seminars held in order to discuss the initiative 
launched by the General Assembly in its resolution 61/89, as well as those 
sponsored by the European Union and organized through the United Nations 
Institute for Disarmament Research in different regions around the world, 

 Taking due note of the views expressed by Member States on the feasibility, 
scope and draft parameters for a comprehensive, legally binding instrument 
establishing common international standards for the import, export and transfer of 
conventional arms, submitted to the Secretary-General at his request,1 

 Welcoming the report of the Group of Governmental Experts,2 which states 
that, in view of the complexity of the issues of conventional arms transfers, further 
consideration of efforts within the United Nations to address the international trade 
in conventional arms is required on a step-by-step basis in an open and transparent 
manner to achieve, on the basis of consensus, a balance that will provide benefit to 
all, with the principles of the Charter at the centre of such efforts, 

 Mindful of the need to prevent the diversion of conventional arms, including 
small arms and light weapons, from the legal into the illicit market,  

 1. Calls upon all States to implement, on a national basis, the relevant 
recommendations contained in section VII of the report of the Group of 
Governmental Experts,2 and commends all States to carefully consider how to 
achieve such implementation in order to ensure that their national import and export

control systems are of the highest possible standard, and further urges those States 
in a position to do so to render assistance in this regard upon request; 

 2. Endorses the report of the Open-ended Working Group3 established by 
the General Assembly in its resolution 63/240 to further consider those elements in 
the report of the Group of Governmental Experts where consensus could be 
developed for their inclusion in an eventual legally binding treaty on the import, 
export and transfer of conventional arms, which provides a balance giving benefit to 
all, with the principles of the Charter and other existing international obligations at 
the centre of such considerations; 

 3. Stresses the need, as was underlined by consensus in the Open-ended 
Working Group, to address, inter alia, the problems relating to the unregulated trade 
in conventional weapons and their diversion to the illicit market, considering that 
such risks can fuel instability, transnational organized crime and terrorism, and that 
international action should be taken to address the problem;  

 4. Decides, therefore, to convene the United Nations Conference on the 
Arms Trade Treaty to sit for four consecutive weeks in 2012 to elaborate a legally 
binding instrument on the highest possible common international standards for the 
transfer of conventional arms;  

 5. Also decides that the United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade 
Treaty will be undertaken in an open and transparent manner, on the basis of 
consensus, to achieve a strong and robust treaty; 

 6. Further decides to consider the remaining sessions of the Open-ended 
Working Group in 2010 and 2011, as a preparatory committee for the United 
Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty; 

 7. Requests the Preparatory Committee, at its four sessions in 2010 and 
2011, to make recommendations to the United Nations Conference on the Arms 
Trade Treaty on the elements that would be needed to attain an effective and 
balanced legally binding instrument on the highest possible common international 
standards for the transfer of conventional arms, bearing in mind the views and 
recommendations expressed in the replies of Member States1 and those contained in 
the report of the Group of Governmental Experts2 and the report of the Open-ended 
Working Group,3 and to present a report containing those elements to the General 
Assembly at its sixty-sixth session;  

 8. Decides to establish a fifth session of the Preparatory Committee in 2012 
of up to three days’ duration to decide on all relevant procedural matters, including 
the composition of the Bureau, the draft agenda and the submission of documents, 
for the United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty; 

 9. Requests the Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States on 
proposed treaty elements and other relevant issues relating to the United Nations 
Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty, and to submit a report to the General 
Assembly at its sixty-sixth session;  

 10. Decides that intergovernmental organizations and specialized agencies, 
having received a standing invitation to participate as observers in the work of the 
General Assembly, may participate as observers in the sessions of the Preparatory

Committee, and requests the Committee to take decisions on the modalities of 
attendance of non-governmental organizations at its sessions;  

 11. Stresses the need to ensure the widest possible and effective participation 
in the United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty in 2012; 

 12. Requests the Secretary-General to render the Preparatory Committee and 
the United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty all necessary assistance, 
including the provision of essential background information and relevant 
documents; 

 13. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
