  Egypt: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its resolutions 1267 (1999), 1373 (2001), 1844 (2008), 1963 (2010), 

2129 (2013), 2195 (2014), 2220 (2015), 2253 (2015), 2322 (2016), 2341 (2017), 

2368 (2017), 

 Reaffirming its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international 

peace and security, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations,  

 Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political 

independence of all States in accordance with the United Nations Charter,  

 Reaffirming that terrorism in all forms and manifestations constitutes one of 

the most serious threats to international peace and security and that any acts of 

terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivations, whenever, 

wherever and by whomsoever committed, and remaining determined to contribute 

further to enhancing the effectiveness of the overall effort to fight this scourge on a 

global level,  

 Reaffirming that terrorism should not be associated with any religion, 

nationality, civilization or ethnic group,  

 Stressing also that States must ensure that any measures taken to combat 

terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, and should adopt 

such measures in accordance with international law, in particular international 

human rights law, refugee law, and humanitarian law,  

 Gravely concerned that the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and 

misuse of small arms and light weapons in many regions of the world continue to 

pose threats to international peace and security, causes significant loss of life, 

contribute to instability and insecurity and continue to undermine the effectiveness 

of the Security Council in discharging its primary responsibility for the maintenance 

of international peace and security,  

 Strongly condemning the continued flow of weapons, including small arms and 

light weapons, military equipment, unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) and their 

components, and improvised explosive device (IED) components to and between 

ISIL (also known as Da’esh), Al-Qaida, their affiliates, and associated groups, 

illegal armed groups and criminals, and encouraging Member States to prevent and 

disrupt procurement networks for such weapons, systems and components between 

ISIL (also known as Da’esh), Al-Qaida and associated individuals, groups, 

undertakings and entities,

 Recognizing that the illicit transfer, theft from national stockpiles and illicit 

craft production can be a source of small arms and light weapons which can enable 

terrorist groups to considerably increase their armed capabilities,  

 Noting with grave concern the increasing and frequent global use of 

improvised explosive devices (IED’s) in terrorist attacks,  

 Stressing the paramount need to prevent illegal armed groups, terrorists and 

other unauthorized recipients from, and identify the networks that support them in, 

obtaining, handling, financing, storing, using or seeking access to all types of 

explosives, whether military or civilian, as well as other military or civilian 

materials and components that can be used to manufacture improvised explosive 

devices, including detonators, detonating cords and chemical components, while at 

the same time avoiding any undue restrictions on the legitimate use of those 

materials,

international, regional and subregional organizations is needed to impede, impair, 

isolate, and incapacitate the terrorist threat, and emphasizing the importance of 

implementing the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (GCTS), 

contained in General Assembly resolution 60/288 of 8 September 2006, and its 

subsequent reviews, 

 Expressing concern at the increased use, in a globalized society, by terrorists 

and their supporters of new information and communications technologies, in 

particular the Internet, to facilitate terrorist acts, as well as their use to incite, 

recruit, fund, or plan terrorist acts,  

 Reiterating its call upon Member States to continue information-sharing, 

through appropriate channels and arrangements, and consistent with international 

and domestic law, on individuals and entities implicated in terrorist activities, in 

particular their supply of weapons and sources of material support, and on the 

ongoing international counter- terrorism cooperation including among special 

services, security agencies and law enforcement organizations and criminal justice 

authorities,  

 Acknowledging the important contribution of relevant Council-mandated arms 

embargoes in helping to eliminate the supply of small arms and light weapons to 

terrorists, and noting the need to improve information sharing on possible arms 

embargo violations between groups of experts, peacekeeping missions within their 

mandates and other relevant United Nations entities, 

 Reaffirming its resolution 1373 (2001) and in particular its decisions that all 

States shall prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts and refrain from 

providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities or persons involved in 

terrorist acts, including by suppressing recruitment of members of terrorist groups 

and eliminating the supply of weapons to terrorists,  

 Reaffirming the importance of full implementation of resolutions 2199 (2015), 

2253 (2015) and 2368 (2017),  

 Urging all States, including States where ISIL is present, to prevent any trade, 

economic, and financial ties with ISIL (also known as Da’esh), Al -Qaida, and 

associated individuals, groups, undertakings, and entities, including through 

enhancing their border security efforts, 

 Recognizing the value of the “Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and 

Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects”, 

including measures aiming at achieving effective physical security and management
