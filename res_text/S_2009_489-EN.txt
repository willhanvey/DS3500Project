draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming its commitment to the continuing and full implementation of 
resolutions 1325 (2000), 1612 (2005), 1674 (2006), 1820 (2008) and 1882 (2009) 
and all relevant statements of its President, 

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 16 July 2009 (S/2009/362), 
but remaining deeply concerned over the lack of progress on the issue of sexual 
violence in situations of armed conflict in particular against women and children, 
notably against girls, and noting as documented in the Secretary-General’s report 
that sexual violence occurs in armed conflicts throughout the world, 

 Reiterating deep concern that, despite its repeated condemnation of violence 
against women and children including all forms of sexual violence in situations of 
armed conflict, and despite its calls addressed to all parties to armed conflict for the 
cessation of such acts with immediate effect, such acts continue to occur, and in 
some situations have become systematic or widespread,  

 Recalling the commitments of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action 
(A/52/231) as well as those contained in the outcome document of the twenty-third 
Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly entitled “Women 2000: 
Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the Twenty-First Century” 
(A/S-23/10/Rev.1), in particular those concerning women and armed conflict,  

 Reaffirming the obligations of States Parties to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Optional Protocol 
thereto, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocols 
thereto, and urging states that have not yet done so to consider ratifying or acceding 
to them, 



S/2009/489  
 

09-53426 2 
 

 Recalling that international humanitarian law affords general protection to 
women and children as part of the civilian population during armed conflicts and 
special protection due to the fact that they can be placed particularly at risk, 

 Recalling the responsibilities of States to end impunity and to prosecute those 
responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other egregious 
crimes perpetrated against civilians, and in this regard, noting with concern that 
only limited numbers of perpetrators of sexual violence have been brought to 
justice, while recognizing that in conflict and in post conflict situations national 
justice systems may be significantly weakened, 

 Reaffirming that ending impunity is essential if a society in conflict or 
recovering from conflict is to come to terms with past abuses committed against 
civilians affected by armed conflict and to prevent future such abuses, drawing 
attention to the full range of justice and reconciliation mechanisms to be considered, 
including national, international and “mixed” criminal courts and tribunals and truth 
and reconciliation commissions, and noting that such mechanisms can promote not 
only individual responsibility for serious crimes, but also peace, truth, reconciliation 
and the rights of the victims, 

 Recalling the inclusion of a range of sexual violence offences in the Rome 
Statute of the International Criminal Court and the statutes of the ad hoc 
international criminal tribunals, 

 Stressing the necessity for all States and non-State parties to conflicts to 
comply fully with their obligations under applicable international law, including the 
prohibition on all forms of sexual violence,  

 Recognizing the need for civilian and military leaders, consistent with the 
principle of command responsibility, to demonstrate commitment and political will 
to prevent sexual violence and to combat impunity and enforce accountability, and 
that inaction can send a message that the incidence of sexual violence in conflicts is 
tolerated, 

 Emphasizing the importance of addressing sexual violence issues from the 
outset of peace processes and mediation efforts, in order to protect populations at 
risk and promote full stability, in particular in the areas of pre-ceasefire 
humanitarian access and human rights agreements, ceasefires and ceasefire 
monitoring, Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR), Security 
Sector Reform (SSR) arrangements, justice and reparations, post-conflict recovery 
and development, 

 Noting with concern the underrepresentation of women in formal peace 
processes, the lack of mediators and ceasefire monitors with proper training in 
dealing with sexual violence, and the lack of women as Chief or Lead peace 
mediators in United Nations-sponsored peace talks,  

 Recognizing that the promotion and empowerment of women and that support 
for women’s organizations and networks are essential in the consolidation of peace 
to promote the equal and full participation of women and encouraging Member 
States, donors, and civil society, including non-governmental organizations, to 
provide support in this respect, 

 Welcoming the inclusion of women in peacekeeping missions in civil, military 
and police functions, and recognizing that women and children affected by armed 



 S/2009/489
 

3 09-53426 
 

conflict may feel more secure working with and reporting abuse to women in 
peacekeeping missions, and that the presence of women peacekeepers may 
encourage local women to participate in the national armed and security forces, 
thereby helping to build a security sector that is accessible and responsive to all, 
especially women, 

 Welcoming the efforts of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to 
develop gender guidelines for military personnel in peacekeeping operations to 
facilitate the implementation of resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008), and 
operational guidance to assist civilian, military and police components of 
peacekeeping missions to effectively implement resolution 1820 (2008), 

 Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 16 July 2009 
(S/2009/362) and stressing that the present resolution does not seek to make any 
legal determination as to whether situations that are referred to in the Secretary-
General’s report are or are not armed conflicts within the context of the Geneva 
Conventions and the Additional Protocols thereto, nor does it prejudge the legal 
status of the non-State parties involved in these situations, 

 Recalling the Council’s decision in resolution 1882 of 4 August 2009 
(S/RES/1882) to expand the Annexed list in the Secretary General’s annual report 
on Children and Armed Conflict of parties in situations of armed conflict engaged in 
the recruitment or use of children in violation of international law to also include 
those parties to armed conflict that engage, in contravention of applicable 
international law, in patterns of killing and maiming of children and/or rape and 
other sexual violence against children, in situations of armed conflict, 

 Noting the role currently assigned to the Office of the Special Adviser on 
Gender Issues to monitor implementation of resolution 1325 and to promote gender 
mainstreaming within the United Nations system, women’s empowerment and 
gender equality, and expressing the importance of effective coordination within the 
United Nations system in these areas, 

 Recognizing that States bear the primary responsibility to respect and ensure 
the human rights of their citizens, as well as all individuals within their territory as 
provided for by relevant international law, 

 Reaffirming that parties to armed conflict bear the primary responsibility to 
take all feasible steps to ensure the protection of affected civilians, 

 Reiterating its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international 
peace and security and, in this connection, its commitment to continue to address 
the widespread impact of armed conflict on civilians, including with regard to 
sexual violence, 

 1. Reaffirms that sexual violence, when used or commissioned as a tactic of 
war in order to deliberately target civilians or as a part of a widespread or 
systematic attack against civilian populations, can significantly exacerbate 
situations of armed conflict and may impede the restoration of international peace 
and security; affirms in this regard that effective steps to prevent and respond to 
such acts of sexual violence can significantly contribute to the maintenance of 
international peace and security; and expresses its readiness, when considering 
situations on the agenda of the Council, to take, where necessary, appropriate steps 
to address widespread or systematic sexual violence in situations of armed conflict;  



S/2009/489  
 

09-53426 4 
 

 2. Reiterates its demand for the complete cessation by all parties to armed 
conflict of all acts of sexual violence with immediate effect; 

 3. Demands that all parties to armed conflict immediately take appropriate 
measures to protect civilians, including women and children, from all forms of 
sexual violence, including measures such as, inter alia, enforcing appropriate 
military disciplinary measures and upholding the principle of command 
responsibility, training troops on the categorical prohibition of all forms of sexual 
violence against civilians, debunking myths that fuel sexual violence and vetting 
candidates for national armies and security forces to ensure the exclusion of those 
associated with serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights 
law, including sexual violence; 

 4. Requests that the United Nations Secretary-General appoint a Special 
Representative to provide coherent and strategic leadership, to work effectively to 
strengthen existing United Nations coordination mechanisms, and to engage in 
advocacy efforts, inter alia with governments, including military and judicial 
representatives, as well as with all parties to armed conflict and civil society, in 
order to address, at both headquarters and country level, sexual violence in armed 
conflict, while promoting cooperation and coordination of efforts among all relevant 
stakeholders, primarily through the inter-agency initiative “United Nations Action 
Against Sexual Violence in Conflict”; 

 5. Encourages the entities comprising UN Action Against Sexual Violence 
in Conflict, as well as other relevant parts of the United Nations system, to support 
the work of the aforementioned Special Representative of the Secretary-General and 
to continue and enhance cooperation and information sharing among all relevant 
stakeholders in order to reinforce coordination and avoid overlap at the headquarters 
and country levels and improve system-wide response;  

 6. Urges States to undertake comprehensive legal and judicial reforms, as 
appropriate, in conformity with international law, without delay and with a view to 
bringing perpetrators of sexual violence in conflicts to justice and to ensuring that 
survivors have access to justice, are treated with dignity throughout the justice 
process and are protected and receive redress for their suffering;  

 7. Urges all parties to a conflict to ensure that all reports of sexual violence 
committed by civilians or by military personnel are thoroughly investigated and the 
alleged perpetrators brought to justice, and that civilian superiors and military 
commanders, in accordance with international humanitarian law, use their authority 
and powers to prevent sexual violence, including by combating impunity;  

 8. Calls upon the Secretary-General to identify and take the appropriate 
measures to deploy rapidly a team of experts to situations of particular concern with 
respect to sexual violence in armed conflict, working through the United Nations 
presence on the ground and with the consent of the host government, to assist 
national authorities to strengthen the rule of law, and recommends making use of 
existing human resources within the United Nations system and voluntary 
contributions, drawing upon requisite expertise, as appropriate, in the rule of law, 
civilian and military judicial systems, mediation, criminal investigation, security 
sector reform, witness protection, fair trial standards, and public outreach; to,
