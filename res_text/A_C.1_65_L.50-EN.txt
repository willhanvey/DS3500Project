 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 49/75 K of 15 December 1994, 51/45 M of 
10 December 1996, 52/38 O of 9 December 1997, 53/77 W of 4 December 1998,

of 5 December 2007, 63/49 of 2 December 2008 and 64/55 of 2 December 2009,  

 Convinced that the continuing existence of nuclear weapons poses a threat to 
humanity and all life on Earth, and recognizing that the only defence against a 
nuclear catastrophe is the total elimination of nuclear weapons and the certainty that 
they will never be produced again, 

 Reaffirming the commitment of the international community to the realization 
of the goal of a nuclear-weapon-free world through total elimination of nuclear 
weapons, 

 Mindful of the solemn obligations of States parties, undertaken in article VI of 
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,1 particularly to pursue

negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear 
arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, 

 Recalling the principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and 
disarmament adopted at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to 
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,2 the unequivocal 
commitment of nuclear-weapon States to accomplish the total elimination of their 
nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament agreed at the 2000 Review 
Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons,3 and the action points agreed at the 2010 Review Conference of the 
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation on Nuclear Weapons as part of the 
conclusions and recommendations for follow-on actions on nuclear disarmament,4 

 Sharing the deep concern at the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of 
any use of nuclear weapons and, in this context, reaffirming the need for all States at 
all times to comply with applicable international law, including international 
humanitarian law,  

 Calling on all nuclear-weapon States to undertake concrete disarmament 
efforts, and stressing that all States need to make special efforts to achieve and 
maintain a world without nuclear weapons,  

 Noting the five-point proposal for nuclear disarmament of the Secretary-
General, in which he proposes, inter alia, the consideration of negotiations on a 
nuclear weapons convention or agreement on a framework of separate mutually 
reinforcing instruments, backed by a strong system of verification,  

 Recalling the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in its 
resolution 50/245 of 10 September 1996, and expressing its satisfaction at the 
increasing number of States that have signed and ratified the Treaty, 

 Recognizing with satisfaction that the Antarctic Treaty,5 the treaties of 
Tlatelolco,6 Rarotonga,7 Bangkok8 and Pelindaba9 and the Treaty on a Nuclear-
Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia, as well as Mongolia’s nuclear-weapon-free 
status, are gradually freeing the entire southern hemisphere and adjacent areas 
covered by those treaties from nuclear weapons, 

 Recognizing also the need for a multilaterally negotiated and legally binding 
instrument to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the threat or use of nuclear 
weapons pending the total elimination  of nuclear weapons,

 Reaffirming the central role of the Conference on Disarmament as the sole 
multilateral disarmament negotiating forum, 

 Emphasizing the need for the Conference on Disarmament to commence 
negotiations on a phased programme for the complete elimination of nuclear 
weapons with a specified framework of time, 

 Stressing the urgent need for the nuclear-weapon States to accelerate concrete 
progress on the thirteen practical steps to implement article VI of the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons leading to nuclear disarmament, contained in 
the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference,10 

 Taking note of the Model Nuclear Weapons Convention, that was submitted to 
the Secretary-General by Costa Rica and Malaysia in 2007 and circulated by the 
Secretary-General,11 

 Desiring to achieve the objective of a legally binding prohibition of the 
development, production, testing, deployment, stockpiling, threat or use of nuclear 
weapons and to achieve their destruction under effective international control, 

 Recalling the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the 
Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, issued on 8 July 1996,12 

 1. Underlines once again the unanimous conclusion of the International 
Court of Justice that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a 
conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict 
and effective international control; 

 2. Calls once again upon all States immediately to fulfil that obligation by 
commencing multilateral negotiations leading to an early conclusion of a nuclear 
weapons convention prohibiting the development, production, testing, deployment, 
stockpiling, transfer, threat or use of nuclear weapons and providing for their 
elimination; 

 3. Requests all States to inform the Secretary-General of the efforts and 
measures they have taken with respect to the implementation of the present 
resolution and nuclear disarmament, and requests the Secretary-General to apprise 
the General Assembly of that information at its sixty-sixth session; 

 4. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-sixth session the 
item entitled “Follow-up to the advisory opinion of the International Court of 
Justice on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons”.
