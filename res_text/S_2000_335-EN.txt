The Security Council,

Recalling its resolution 1265 (1999) of 17 September 1999, the statement of its
President of 12 February 1999 (S/PRST/1999/6) and other relevant resolutions and
statements of its President,

Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 8 September 1999 on
the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict (S/1999/957),

Expressing its appreciation to the informal Working Group established
pursuant to resolution 1265 (1999) for its work,

Expressing further its regret that civilians account for the vast majority of
casualties in armed conflicts and increasingly are targeted by combatants and armed
elements, reaffirming its concern at the hardships borne by civilians during armed
conflict, in particular as a result of acts of violence directed against them, especially
women, children and other vulnerable groups, including refugees and internally
displaced persons, and recognizing the consequent impact this has on durable peace,
reconciliation and development,

Bearing in mind its primary responsibility under the Charter of the United
Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security, and underlining the
importance of taking measures aimed at conflict prevention and resolution,

Reaffirming its commitment to the Purposes of the Charter of the United
Nations as set out in Article 1 (1-4) of the Charter, and to the Principles of the
Charter as set out in Article 2 (1-7) of the Charter, including its commitment to the
principles of the political independence, sovereign equality and territorial integrity
of all States, and to respect for the sovereignty of all States,

Underlining the need for all parties concerned to comply with the provisions of
the Charter of the United Nations and with rules and principles of international law,
in particular international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law, and to
implement fully the relevant decisions of the Security Council,

1. Emphasizes the need, when considering ways to provide for the
protection of civilians in armed conflict, to proceed on a case-by-case basis, taking
into account the particular circumstances, and affirms its intention to take into
account relevant recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General
of 8 September 1999 when carrying out its work;

2. Reaffirms its strong condemnation of the deliberate targeting of civilians
or other protected persons in situations of armed conflict, and calls upon all parties
to put an end to such practices;

3. Notes that the overwhelming majority of internally displaced persons and
other vulnerable groups in situations of armed conflict are civilians and, as such, are
entitled to the protection afforded to civilians under existing international

conflict prevention, invites Member States and the Secretary-General to bring to its

personnel to civilians in armed conflicts, calls upon all parties concerned, including
neighbouring States, to cooperate fully with the United Nations Humanitarian
Coordinator and United Nations agencies in providing such access, invites States
and the Secretary-General to bring to its attention information regarding the
deliberate denial of such access in violation of international law, where such denial
may constitute a threat to international peace and security, and, in this regard,
expresses its willingness to consider such information and, when necessary, to adopt
appropriate steps;

9. Reaffirms its grave concern at the harmful and widespread impact of

personnel, utilizing the stand-by arrangements as appropriate;

such situations may constitute a threat to international peace and security, expresses,
in this regard, its willingness to consider such situations and, where necessary, adopt
appropriate steps to help create a secure environment for civilians endangered by
conflicts, including by providing support to States concerned in this regard, and
recalls, in this regard, its resolution 1208 (1998) of 19 November 1998;

temporary security zones and safe corridors for the protection of civilians and the

should include a mass-media component that can disseminate information about
international humanitarian law and human rights law, including peace education and
children’s protection, while also giving objective information about the activities of
the United Nations, and further affirms that, where appropriate, regional

S/2000/335

peacekeeping operations should be encouraged to include such mass-media
components;

19. Reiterates the importance of compliance with relevant provisions of
international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law and of providing
appropriate training in such law, including child and gender-related provisions, as
well as in negotiation and communications skills, cultural awareness, civil-military
coordination and sensitivity in the prevention of HIV/AIDS and other communicable
diseases, to personnel involved in peacemaking, peacekeeping and peace-building
activities, requests the Secretary-General to disseminate appropriate guidance and to

Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which
May be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects of

that their implementation will have on the safety of civilians and encourages those
in a position to do so to support humanitarian mine action, including by providing
financial assistance to this end;

21. Notes that the excessive accumulation and destabilizing effect of small
arms and light weapons pose a considerable impediment to the provision of
humanitarian assistance and have a potential to exacerbate and prolong conflicts,
endanger civilians and undermine security and the confidence required for a return
to peace and stability;

22. Recalls the decision of the members of the Council set out in the Note by
its President of 17 April 2000 (S/2000/319) to establish on a temporary basis an
