 Expressing its grave concern also, in particular, about the continuation by 

Israel, the occupying Power, of illegal settlement activities, including measures 

regarding the so-called E-1 plan, its construction of the wall in and around East 

Jerusalem, its restrictions on Palestinian access to and residence in East Jerusalem 

and the further isolation of the city from the rest of the Occupied Palestinian 

Territory, which are having a detrimental effect on the lives of Palestinians and 

could prejudge a final status agreement on Jerusalem,  

 Expressing its grave concern further about the continuing Israeli demolition of 

Palestinian homes and other civilian infrastructure in and around East Jerusalem, the 

revocation of residency rights, and the eviction and displacement of numerous 

Palestinian families from East Jerusalem neighbourhoods, including Bedouin 

families, as well as other acts of provocation and incitement, including by Israeli 

settlers, in the city, including desecration of mosques and churches,  

 Expressing its concern about the Israeli excavations undertaken in the Old 

City of Jerusalem, including in and around religious sites, 

 Expressing its grave concern, in particular, about tensions, provocations and 

incitement regarding the holy places of Jerusalem, including the Haram al -Sharif, 

and urging restraint and respect for the sanctity of the holy sites by all sid es, 

 Reaffirming that the international community, through the United Nations, has 

a legitimate interest in the question of the City of Jerusalem and in the protection of 

the unique spiritual, religious and cultural dimensions of the city, as foreseen in 

relevant United Nations resolutions on this matter,  

 Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in the 

Middle East,
2
   

 1. Reiterates its determination that any actions taken by Israel, the 

occupying Power, to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the Holy 

City of Jerusalem are illegal and therefore null and void and have no validity 

whatsoever, and calls upon Israel to immediately cease all such illegal and unilateral 

measures; 

 2. Stresses that a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the question of 

the City of Jerusalem should take into account the legitimate concerns of both the 

Palestinian and Israeli sides and should include internationally guaranteed 

provisions to ensure the freedom of religion and of conscience of its inhabitants, as 

well as permanent, free and unhindered access to the holy places by people of all 

religions and nationalities; 

 3. Also stresses the need for the parties to observe calm and restraint and to 

refrain from provocative actions, incitement and inflammatory rhetoric, especially 

in areas of religious and cultural sensitivity, and expresses its grave concern in 

particular about the recent series of negative incidents in East Jerusalem;  

 4. Calls for respect for the historic status quo at the holy places of 

Jerusalem, including the Haram al-Sharif, in word and practice, and urges all sides 

to work immediately and cooperatively to defuse tensions and halt all provocations, 

incitement and violence at the holy sites in the City;  

 5. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its 

seventy-third session on the implementation of the present resolution.
