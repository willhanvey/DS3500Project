interconnected world is of critical importance for the success of national efforts for 

achieving sustainable development in all countries, and that, while efforts have been

extensive consultations and joint contribution for the shared benefits,

arrangements, including integration processes, aimed at promoting development and 

cooperation among their members,  

 Noting the critical importance of the ongoing efforts of multilateral 

institutions, particularly those of the United Nations system, to find common 

solutions to global challenges and the relevance of intergovernmental groupings that

and recognizing the benefits derived from increased interaction with those
