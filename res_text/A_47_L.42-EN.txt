armed forces of a State of the territory of another State, or any military
occupation, however temporary, resulting from such invasion or attack, or any
annexation by the use of force of the territory of another State or part
thereof" and provided that "no consideration of whatever nature, whether

Reaffirming once more the applicability of the Geneva Convention relative
to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, 11 to
the occupied Syrian Golan and the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967,
including Jerusalem, and the other occupied Arab territories,

Noting that Israel has refused, in violation of Article 25 of the Charter
of the United Nations, to accept and carry out the numerous relevant
resolutions of the Security Council, in particular resolution 497 (1981),

Deeply concerned that Israel has not withdrawn from the Syrian Golan,
which is under occupation since 1967, contrary to the relevant Security
Council and General Assembly resolutions,

Taking note with satisfaction of the convening of the Madrid Peace
Conference on the Middle East on the basis of Security Council resolutions
242 (1967) and 338 (1973), regretting, however, that the desired sUbstantial
results have not been achieved,

1. Declares that Israel has failed so far to comply with Security
Council resolution 497 (1981) and the relevant resolutions of the General
Assembly;

2. Declares once more that Israel's decision to impose its laws,
jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan is illegal and
therefore null and void and has no validity whatsoever;

3. Declares that the Knesset decision of 11 November 1991 annexing the
occupied Syrian Golan constitutes a grave violation of Security Council
resolution 497 (1981) and therefore is null and void and has no validity
whatsoever;

4. Declares all Israeli policies and practices of, or aimed at,
annexation of the occupied Arab territories and the Palestinian territories
occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem, and occupied Syrian Golan to be
illegal and in violation of international law and of the relevant United
Nations resolutions;

5. Determines once more that all actions taken by Israel to give effect
to its decisions relating to the occupied Syrian Golan are illegal and invalid
and shall not be recognized;

6. Reaffirms its determination that all relevant provisions of the
Regulations annexed to the Hague Convention IV of 1901, .J/ and the Geneva
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of
12 August 1949, continue to apply to the Syrian territory occupied by Israel
since 1967, and calls upon the parties thereto to respect and ensure respect
for their obigations under these instruments in all circumstances;

7. Determines once more that the continued occupation of the Syrian
Golan since 1967 and its de facto annexation by Israel on 14 December 1981,
following Israel's decision to impose its laws, jurisdiction and
administration on that territory, constitute a continuing threat to peace and
security in the region;

8. Firmly emphasizes once more its demand that Israel, the occupying
Power, rescind forthwith its illegal decision of 14 December 1981 to impose
its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the Syrian Golan, and its
decisions of 11 November 1991, which resulted in the effective annexation of
that terr i tory;

9. Demands once more that Israel withdraw from the occupied Syrian
Golan in implementation of the relevant Security Council and General Assembly
resolutions;

10. Calls upon the international community to urge Israel to withdraw
from the occupied Syrian Golan and other occupied Arab territories for the
establishment of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region;

11. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at
its forty-eighth session on the implementation of the present resolution.
