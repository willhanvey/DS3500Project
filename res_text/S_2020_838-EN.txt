Security agenda and its priorities, by ensuring and promoting the full, equal and 

meaningful participation of women in peace processes, including through 

mainstreaming a gender perspective, and remain committed to increasing the number 

of civilian and uniformed women in peacekeeping at all levels and in all positions, 

including senior leadership positions,  

 Recognizing the indispensable role of women in increasing the overall 

performance and effectiveness of peacekeeping operations, further recognizing that 

the presence of women and better balance between men and women among 

peacekeepers contribute to, among others, greater credibility of the missions among 

the population, more effective community engagement, and enhanced protection 

responses, 

 Noting with appreciation the progress made in efforts undertaken by the 

Secretary-General to mobilize all partners and stakeholders in support of more 

effective United Nations peacekeeping through the Secretary-General’s “Action for 

Peacekeeping” initiative, which places high importance on promoting the Women, 

Peace and Security agenda, alongside advancing political solutions, strengthening 

protection of civilians, improving the safety and security of peacekeepers, supporting 

effective performance and accountability, strengthening the impact of peacekeeping 

on peacebuilding and sustaining peace, improving peacekeeping partnerships, and 

strengthening the conduct of peacekeeping operations and personnel,  

 Recalling resolution 2242 (2015) and its request that Secretary-General initiate, 

in collaboration with Member States, a strategy to double the number of women in 

military and police contingents of United Nations peacekeeping operations by 2020 

and further requests that this strategy ensure the full, effective and meaningful 

participation of women in all aspects of peacekeeping, further recalling the Secretary-

General’s System-Wide Strategy on Gender Parity and Uniformed Gender Parity 

Strategy 2018–2028, and stressing the need to continue the efforts to increase 

participation of women in peacekeeping operations,  

 Stressing that promoting increased women’s participation in peacekeeping 

operations requires collective commitment and concerted efforts by all Member States 

and the United Nations Secretariat, and should be supported with appropriate 

resources, welcoming continuing efforts and initiatives by Member States and the 

United Nations Secretariat to increase women’s participation in peacekeeping 

operations, including by providing uniformed women personnel with equal access to 

education, training and capacity building, networking opportunities, and taking steps 

to better understand and address barriers to participation of women in peacekeeping, 

 Recalling its resolution 2242 (2015), recognizing the indispensable role of 

women in United Nations peacekeeping and welcoming efforts to incentivise greater 

numbers of women in military, police and civilian deployed in United Nations 

peacekeeping operations, and noting the importance of increasing the number of 

women in leadership positions and of ensuring that the needs and participation of 

women are integrated in all stages of mission planning and implementation through 

the inclusion of appropriate gender technical expertise,  

 Underscoring the importance it places on the safety and security of 

peacekeepers, including women peacekeepers, in the field and the need for the 

Secretary-General and Troop-and Police-Contributing Countries and Member States 

to work together to ensure that missions are adequately resourced and all
