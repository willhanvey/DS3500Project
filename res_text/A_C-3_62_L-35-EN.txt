 Welcoming the launch of the Alliance of Civilizations initiative, intended to

civilizations, and welcoming in this regard the Declaration and Programme of 
Action adopted by the Non-Aligned Movement Ministerial Meeting on Human 
Rights and Cultural Diversity, held in Tehran on 3 and 4 September 2007,4

religion or belief constitutes an affront to human dignity and a disavowal of the 
principles of the Charter, 

 Convinced that respect for cultural, ethnic, religious and linguistic diversity, as 
well as dialogue among and within civilizations, is essential for peace,

tolerance, respect for and freedom of religion and belief,

religious tolerance and the elimination of discrimination based on religion or belief,  

 Alarmed at the continuing negative impact of the events of 11 September 2001

violence based on religion or belief, intimidation and coercion motivated by

 Noting with concern that defamation of religions is among the causes of social 
disharmony and leads to violations of human rights, 

 Deeply alarmed at the rising trends towards discrimination based on religion 
and faith, including in some national policies and laws that stigmatize groups of

people belonging to certain religions and faiths under a variety of pretexts relating 
to security and illegal immigration, and noting that the increased intellectual and 
media discourse is among the factors exacerbating such discrimination,

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General and the conclusion 
thereof;5

and manifestations of intolerance and discrimination in matters of religion or belief 
still in evidence in some regions of the world;

in the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September 2001;

reaction to counter-terrorism measures, defamation of religions becomes an 
aggravating factor that contributes to the denial of fundamental rights and freedoms

 8. Deplores the use of the print, audio-visual and electronic media, 
including the Internet, and any other means to incite acts of violence, xenophobia or 
related intolerance and discrimination against Islam or any other religion, as well as 
targeting of religious symbols;  

 9. Stresses the need to effectively combat defamation of all religions, Islam 
and Muslims in particular; 

 10. Emphasizes that everyone has the right to freedom of expression, which 
should be exercised with responsibility and may therefore be subject to limitations 
as provided by law and necessary for respect of the rights or reputations of others, 
protection of national security or of public order, public health or morals and respect 
for religions and beliefs;

constitutional systems, adequate protection against acts of hatred, discrimination,

religious hatred and intolerance;

appropriate education or training is provided;

and harmonizing actions at the local, national, regional and international levels 
through education and awareness-raising; 

 15. Urges States to ensure equal access to education for all, in law and in 
practice, including access to free primary education for all children, both girls and 
boys, and access for adults to lifelong learning and education based on respect for 
human rights, diversity and tolerance, without discrimination of any kind, and to 
refrain from any legal or other measures leading to racial segregation in access to 
schooling;  

 16. Calls upon the international community to initiate a global dialogue to

religion;

Human Rights to promote and include human rights aspects in the educational 
programmes, particularly the World Programme for Human Rights Education 
proclaimed by the General Assembly on 10 December 2004,6 and calls upon the 
High Commissioner to: 

 (a) Continue those efforts, focusing on the contributions of cultures, as well 
as religious and cultural diversity; 

 (b) Collaborate with other relevant international organizations in holding 
joint conferences designed to encourage the dialogue among civilizations and 
promote understanding of the universality of human rights and their implementation 
at various levels, in particular the Office of the High Representative for the Alliance 
of Civilizations and the Unit mandated within the Secretariat to interact with various 
entities within the United Nations system and coordinate their contribution to the 
intergovernmental process; 

 19. Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report on the implementation 
of the present resolution, including on the possible correlation between defamation 
of religions and the upsurge in incitement, intolerance and hatred in many parts of 
the world, to the General Assembly at its sixty-third session.
