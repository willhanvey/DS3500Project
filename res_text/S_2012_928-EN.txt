criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivations, whenever and by 
whomsoever committed, and reiterating its unequivocal condemnation of Al-Qaida

ongoing and multiple criminal terrorist acts aimed at causing the deaths of innocent

 Reaffirming that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any 
religion, nationality or civilization, 

 Recalling the Presidential Statement of the Security Council 
(S/PRST/2012/17) of 4 May 2012 on threats to international peace and security 
caused by terrorist acts,  

 Reaffirming the need to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter

approach involving the active participation and collaboration of all States, and

assets and the names of any individuals or entities who would be in a position to

ensure the Al-Qaida Sanctions List is as updated and accurate as possible through 
identifying listings that no longer remain appropriate and confirming listings that 
remain appropriate, and notes that the Committee’s consideration of a delisting 
request after the date of adoption of this resolution, pursuant to the procedures set
