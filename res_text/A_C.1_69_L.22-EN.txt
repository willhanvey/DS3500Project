Agenda item 96 

General and complete disarmament 
 

 

 

  Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria and Switzerland: draft resolution 
 

 

  Decreasing the operational readiness of nuclear weapons systems 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 62/36 of 5 December 2007, 63/41 of 2 December 

2008, 65/71 of 8 December 2010 and 67/46 of 3 December 2012,  

 Recalling also that the maintenance of nuclear weapons on high alert was a 

feature of cold war nuclear postures, and welcoming the increased confidence and 

transparency since the cessation of the cold war,  

 Concerned that, notwithstanding the end of the cold war, several thousand 

nuclear weapons remain on high alert, ready to be launched within minutes,  

 Noting the continuing engagement in multilateral disarmament forums in 

support of further reductions to the operational status of nuclear weapons systems,  

 Recognizing that the maintenance of nuclear weapons systems at a high level 

of readiness increases the risk of the unintentional or accidental use of such 

weapons, which would have catastrophic humanitarian consequences,  

 Recognizing also that reductions in deployments and the lowering of 

operational status contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security, 

as well as to the process of nuclear disarmament, through the enhancement of 

confidence-building and transparency measures and a diminishing role for nuclear 

weapons in security policies, 

 Welcoming the steps taken by some States in support of nuclear disarmament, 

including de-targeting initiatives, increasing the amount of preparation time required 

for deployment and other measures to diminish further the possibility of nuclear 

launches resulting from accidents, unauthorized actions or misperceptions,  

 Welcoming also the adoption by consensus of the conclusions and 

recommendations for follow-on actions by the 2010 Review Conference of the 



A/C.1/69/L.22 
 

 

14-62809 2/2 

 

Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,1 including the 

commitments of the nuclear-weapon States to promptly engage with a view to, inter 

alia, considering the legitimate interest of non-nuclear-weapon States in further 

reducing the operational status of nuclear weapons systems in ways that promote 

international stability and security,  

 Acknowledging, in this regard, the continued dialogue among the nuclear-

weapon States to advance their nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament 

commitments under the action plan of the 2010 Review Conference and the 

potential of this process for leading to deeper  engagement on nuclear disarmament 

and greater mutual confidence, 

 Taking note of the references to operational readiness in reports of the nuclear-

weapon States to the third session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2015 

Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 

Weapons, 

 Welcoming all opportunities to address the further reduction of the operational 

status of nuclear weapons systems as a step leading to nuclear disarmament,  

 1. Calls for further practical steps to be taken to decrease the operational 

readiness of nuclear weapons systems, with a view to ensuring that all nuclear 

weapons are removed from high alert status;  

 2.  Looks forward to the issue of the lowering of the operational readiness of 

nuclear weapons systems being addressed further at the 2015 Review Conference of 

the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; 

 3. Urges States to update the General Assembly on progress made in the 

implementation of the present resolution; 

 4. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
