 Recalling that the G5 Sahel States have the responsibility to provide the 

FC-G5S with adequate resources, encouraging additional support from bilateral and 

multilateral partners, including through the provision of adequate logistical, 

operational and financial assistance to the FC-G5S, as appropriate, stressing that 

secure funding and support for the FC-G5S will make a critical contribution to a 

lasting stabilization of the Sahel region, and noting the complementarity that 

bilateral and multilateral support can play in addressing the needs of the FC-G5S 

comprehensively and in the most efficient way,

Union missions (EU Training Mission in Mali — EUTM Mali, EU Capacity 

Building Mission in Mali — EUCAP Sahel Mali, and EU Capacity Building 

Mission in Niger — EUCAP Sahel Niger) in providing training and strategic advice 

to national security forces in the Sahel region,  

 Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on the G5 Sahel joint force 

of 16 October 2017 (S/2017/869), including its outline of a range of possible 

options for United Nations support to the FC-G5S, and noting that this report was 

warmly welcomed by G5 Sahel States,  

 Recalling the mission it carried out to the Sahel region from 19 to 22 October, 

through visits to Mali, Mauritania and Burkina Faso, with the main objectives to 

assess the situation in the G5 Sahel States as well as to discuss the observations and 

recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary -General mentioned above, 

 Recognizing that the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization 

Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) and the FC-G5S have the potential to be mutually 

beneficial instruments to restore peace and stability in Mali and in the Sahel region, 

and underlining that they have the potential to constitute a positive interaction 

between a United Nations peacekeeping operation and an African operation,  

 Reiterating its serious concern at the continuing lack of key capabilities for 

MINUSMA, and urging Member States to provide the necessary capacities, 

including troops and police that have adequate capabilities, pre -deployment and,

S/2017/1022 

 

3/7 17-22158 

 

 Stressing that a military response to the threats faced by G5 Sahel States can 

only be effective if conducted in full compliance with international law, by taking 

active steps to minimize the risk of harm to civilians in all areas of operation, as 

well as if accompanied by the rapid and effective implementation of inclusive 

regional strategies encompassing security, governance, development, human rights 

and humanitarian issues, 

 Emphasizing the important role of women in prevention and resolution of 

conflicts, in peacebuilding as well as in post-conflict situations, as recognized in the 

relevant Security Council resolutions, including resolution 1325 (2000) and 

resolution 2242 (2015), 

 Noting that the activities of terrorist organizations, including those benefiting 

from transnational organized crime, in the Sahel region constitu te a threat to

  Operationalization and status of the FC-G5S 
 

 1. Welcomes the steady and rapid progress achieved in the operationalization 

of the FC-G5S, including through the fulfilment of the initial operational capaci ty of 

the joint force on 17 October 2017, and takes positive note of its first operation 

“Hawbi”, which took place on the Center boundary zone;  

 2. Commends the G5 Sahel States for their sustained efforts towards the full 

and effective operationalization of the FC-G5S, and encourages them to continue to 

take appropriate measures in order for the FC-G5S to reach its full operational 

capacity by the announced timeframe of March 2018;  

 3. Recalls that the deployment of the FC-G5S throughout the territories of 

its contributing countries, with up to 5,000 military, civilian and police personnel, 

with a view to restoring peace and security in the Sahel region, is authorized by a 

decision of the African Union Peace and Security Council for an initial period of 12 

months starting from 13 April 2017;  

 

  Groupe de soutien 
 

 4. Notes that the Groupe de Soutien referred to in the strategic concept of 

operations of the FC-G5S (“the Groupe de Soutien”) represents a useful and 

appropriate platform to exchange views on the operationalization of the FC-G5S, 

the mobilization and coordination of international support, further clarification of its 

strategic objectives and concept of operations as well as the implementation of 

comprehensive strategies encompassing security, governance, development, human 

rights and humanitarian issues; 

 5. Encourages the G5 Sahel States to clarify the format and modalities of 

work of the Groupe de Soutien, which is due to involve key regional and 

international actors supporting the FC-G5S, and meet alternatively at technical and 

political level; 

 6. Calls upon the G5 Sahel rotating presidency to convene on a regular 

basis meetings of the Groupe de Soutien, in order to continue to ensure full and 

effective integration of the FC-G5S in its regional and international environment as 

well as the efficient coordination of the international support to the FC -G5S;  

 

  Coordination of international support 
 

 7. Welcomes the central role played by the G5 Sahel, supported by the 

European Union and its member States notably through the “coordination hub” 

mechanism, and in close coordination with the United Nations and the African

Union, in identifying the needs of the FC-G5S and coordinating the bilateral 

contributions of the donors; 

 8. Notes the positive role of the Permanent Secretariat of the G5 Sahel to 

support the cooperation of G5 Sahel States in the field of security, governance and 

development, and requests the Secretary-General, through UNOWAS, to provide 

technical assistance, within existing mandate and resources, to the Permanent 

Secretariat of the G5 Sahel in order to achieve this task;  

 

  Bilateral support 
 

 9. Welcomes the commitments made by the G5 Sahel States and several 

donors to provide support to the FC-G5S, which amount to a total of more than 177 

million euros up to date, and notes with satisfaction the steps already taken to fulfil 

some of these commitments;  

 10. Notes with appreciation the proposal made by the European Union, with 

the support of the G5 Sahel States, that its African Peace Facility serves as a 

mechanism for channelling international voluntary contributions in support of the 

FC-G5S, in close coordination with other contributions;  

 11. Welcomes the intent of the current chairmanship of the G5 Sahel, the 

United Nations, the African Union and the European Union to co -host an 

international pledging conference in support of the FC -G5S in Brussels, and 

encourages all international and regional partners to seize this occasion to commit 

to provide bilateral assistance to the FC-G5S; 

 

  United Nations support 
 

 12. Stresses that the efforts of the FC-G5S to counter the activities of 

terrorist groups and other organized criminal groups will contribute to create a more 

secure environment in the Sahel region, and thus facilitate the fulfilment by 

MINUSMA of its mandate to stabilize Mali, and further stresses that operational 

and logistical support from MINUSMA, as outlined in paragraph 13 below, has the 

potential to allow the FC-G5S, given its current level of capacities, to enhance its 

ability to deliver on its mandate;  

 13. Requests in this context the Secretary-General to take appropriate steps 

to conclude as soon as possible a technical agreement between the United Nations, 

the European Union and G5 Sahel States, with a view to providing specified 

operational and logistical support through MINUSMA to the FC -G5S (“the 

technical agreement”), and that the support provided pursuant to the technical 

agreement should: 

 (a) apply to G5 Sahel States defence and security forces only when operating 

on Malian territory in the framework of the joint force,  

 (b) comprise MEDEVAC and CASEVAC, access to life support consumables 

(fuel, water and rations) and use of UN engineering plant equipment and material, 

as well as uniformed MINUSMA engineering enabling units to assist in preparation 

of FC-G5S operational bases in Mali, 

 (c) be subject to full financial reimbursement to the United Nations, through 

an EU-coordinated financing mechanism established for the coordination of 

international voluntary contributions to support the FC -G5S, 

 (d) be conducted at the discretion of the Special Representative of the 

Secretary-General for Mali and Head of MINUSMA, in close consultation with the 

Force Commander, and without affecting MINUSMA’s capacity to implement its 



 
S/2017/1022 

 

5/7 17-22158 

 

mandate and strategic priorities, and be restricted to the areas of operations of 

MINUSMA where such support is compatible with its current level of capacities;  

 14. Encourages the technical agreement to constitute a temporary measure 

towards full self-sufficiency of the FC-G5S, and emphasizes that MINUSMA’s 

support arrangements, including MEDEVAC and CASEVAC, engineering capability 

as well as logistical supply chains, should not be adjusted to facilitate support to the 

FC-G5S if such an adjustment would adversely impact its own operations or put 

mission personnel at undue risk; 

 15. Recommends that the Secretary-General periodically reviews the 

implementation of the technical agreement, with a particular focus on 

operationalization of the FC-G5S; 

 16. Calls upon MINUSMA and the FC-G5S to continue to ensure adequate 

coordination and exchange of information, through relevant mechanisms, of their 

operations, within their respective mandates, and reiterates in this regard its request 

to the Secretary-General to enhance cooperation between MINUSMA and the G5 

Sahel Members States through provision of relevant intelligence and liaiso n officers 

from the G5 Sahel Members States to MINUSMA;  

 

  Obligations under international law and human rights policy  
 

 17. Underlines the need for the operations of the FC-G5S to be conducted in 

full compliance with international law, including international humanitarian law, 

international human rights law and international refugee law, as applicable, and for 

G5 Sahel States and the FC-G5S to take active steps to minimize the risk of harm to 

civilians in all areas of operation as well as to ensure accountability and transfer to 

criminal justice of those apprehended during operations and suspected of terrorist 

and related crimes; 

 18. Underlines that a gender perspective should be taken into account in 

implementing all aspects of the strategic concept of operations of the FC-G5S, 

including by ensuring that gender analysis and women’s participation are integrated 

into assessments, planning and operations;  

 19. Underlines the need for the G5 Sahel States to take into account the 

association of children with terrorist and transnational organized criminal groups to 

protect and consider as victims children who have been released or otherwise 

separated from those groups and to pay particular attention to the protection, release 

and reintegration of all children associated with those groups; 

 20. Welcomes the African Union’s zero tolerance stance on sexual 

exploitation and abuse, and underlines the need for the G5 Sahel States to take 

adequate measures to prevent and combat impunity for sexual exploitation and 

abuse by their personnel operating in the framework of the FC -G5S; 

 21. Calls upon the G5 Sahel States to ensure the highest standards of 

transparency, conduct and discipline for their contingents operating in the 

framework of the FC-G5S, to establish a robust compliance framework to prevent, 

investigate, address and publicly report violations and abuses of human rights law 

and violations of international humanitarian law related to the FC -G5S (“the 

compliance framework”); 

 22. Calls upon regional and international partners to support, through 

voluntary contributions, technical assistance and advice, G5 Sahel States’ efforts in 

the establishment and implementation of the compliance framework by the G5 Sahel 

States and the FC-G5S, and encourages all relevant partners, including United 

Nations relevant entities, EUTM, EUCAP, the French forces, within the framework 



S/2017/1022 
 

 

17-22158 6/7 

 

of their respective mandates and existing resources, to support the implementation 

of the compliance framework and to ensure close coordination of their ac tivities in 

this regard;  

 23. Notes that the Secretary-General will ensure that any support provided to 

non-United Nations security forces is provided in strict compliance with the Human 

Rights Due Diligence Policy on United Nations support to Non -United Nations 

security forces (HRDDP), and calls upon the FC-G5S to cooperate with the United 

Nations in implementing the HRDDP, including by ensuring that the relevant 

monitoring and reporting mechanisms are in place and functional;

reconstituted armed and security forces in Mali,  

 (d) progress in the decentralization process,  

 (e) ensuring full and equal women’s participation;  

 26. Welcomes the appointment of the Carter Center as the Independent 

Observer referred to in the Agreement, recalls that the mandate of the Independent 

Observer, as defined by the Agreement, is to objectively evaluate progress towards 

implementation of the Agreement, including through the release every 4 months of a 

comprehensive report on the implementation of the commitments undertaken in the 

Agreement, identifying any impediments, determining responsibility and 

recommending the steps to be taken, and calls upon all parties to fully cooperate 

with the Carter Center in order to facilitate the implementation of its mandate as 

Independent Observer; 

 27. Underlines that engaging in hostilities in violation of the Agreement as 

well as actions taken that obstruct, or that obstruct by prolonged delay, or that 

threaten the implementation of the Agreement constitute a basis for sanctions 

designations pursuant to resolution 2374 (2017), among other designation criteria;
