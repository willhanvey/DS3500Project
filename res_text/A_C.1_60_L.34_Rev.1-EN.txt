and Timor-Leste: revised draft resolution

Addressing the negative humanitarian and development impact
of the illicit manufacture, transfer and circulation of small arms
and light weapons and their excessive accumulation

The General Assembly,

Reaffirming its respect for and commitment to international law and the
purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations,

Recognizing that, as stated in the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat
and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects,1
the illicit manufacture, transfer and circulation of small arms and light weapons and
their excessive accumulation have a wide range of humanitarian and socio-economic
consequences and pose a serious threat to peace, reconciliation, safety, security,
stability and sustainable development at the individual, local, national, regional and
international levels,

Concerned by the implications that poverty and underdevelopment may have
for the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects, and determined
to reduce the human suffering caused by the illicit trade in small arms and light
weapons in all its aspects and to enhance the respect for life and the dignity of the
human person through the promotion of a culture of peace,

Reaffirming the urgent necessity for international cooperation and assistance,
including financial and technical assistance, as appropriate, to support and facilitate
efforts at the local, national, regional and global levels to prevent, combat and
eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects,

Recalling the Second Biennial Meeting of States to Consider the
Implementation of the Programme of Action, at which States, while welcoming the

significant progress made in that regard, recognized that further action was required
to fulfil the commitments undertaken in the Programme of Action,2

Recognizing that, in 2005,3 world leaders expressed grave concern at the
negative effects on development, peace and security and human rights posed by,
inter alia, the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons and that they committed
themselves to supporting the implementation of the Programme of Action,

Noting in that regard that the 2006 review conference on the Programme of
Action represents an opportunity to address interconnected peace and security and
development challenges, which are relevant to the agenda of the said conference,

Placing particular emphasis on the regions of the world where conflicts have
come to an end and where serious problems with the excessive and destabilizing
accumulation of small arms and light weapons have to be dealt with urgently,

1. Calls upon States, when addressing the issue of the illicit trade in small
arms and light weapons in all its aspects, to explore ways, as appropriate, to more
effectively address the humanitarian and development impact of the illicit
manufacture, transfer and circulation of small arms and light weapons and their
excessive accumulation, in particular in conflict or post-conflict situations,
including by:

(a) Developing, where appropriate, comprehensive armed violence
prevention programmes integrated into national development strategies, including
poverty reduction strategies;

(b) Building on the commitment by States and appropriate international and
regional organizations in a position to do so to, upon the request of the relevant
authorities, seriously considering rendering assistance, including technical and
financial assistance where needed, such as small arms funds, in order to support the
implementation of measures to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in
small arms and light weapons in all its aspects, as contained in the Programme of
Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light
Weapons in All Its Aspects;1

(c) Encouraging United Nations peacekeeping operations to address the safe
storage and disposal of small arms and light weapons as an integral part of
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes;

(d) Systematically including national measures to regulate small arms and
light weapons in longer term post-conflict peacebuilding strategies and programmes;

(e) Ensuring, where appropriate: that the activities mentioned in
subparagraphs (c) and (d) above take full account of the roles that women and
women’s organizations could play in small arms disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration processes; the requirement that the needs of women and girl
combatants and dependants be addressed in disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration programmes; and the commitment to promote and protect the rights
and welfare of children in armed conflicts.
