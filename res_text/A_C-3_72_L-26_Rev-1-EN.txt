of implementation by all stakeholders,  

 Welcoming the successful conclusion of the United Nations Conference on 

Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III), held in Quito from 17 to

7
 and is informed by 

other instruments such as the Declaration on the Right to Development, 

 Recognizing the significance of the events held to commemorate the thirtieth

and mutually reinforcing nature of all civil, cultural, economic, political and social 

rights, including the right to development,  

 Reaffirming also that democracy, development and respect for human rights 

and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that 

democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their 

own political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in 

all aspects of their lives, and in that context noting that the promotion and 

protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and

 Recognizing that, while development facilitates the enjoyment of all human 

rights, the lack of development may not be invoked to justify the  abridgement of 

internationally recognized human rights,  

 Recognizing also that Member States should cooperate with one another in 

ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development, that the 

international community should promote effective international cooperation, in 

particular to revitalize a global partnership for development, for the realization of 

the right to development and the elimination of obstacles to development and that 

lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires 

effective development policies at the national level, as well as equitable economic 

relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level,  

 Recognizing further that poverty is an affront to human dignity,  

 Recognizing that extreme poverty and hunger are among the greatest global 

threats and require the collective commitment of the international community for 

their eradication, pursuant to Millennium Development Goal 1 and Sustainable 

Development Goals 1 and 2, and therefore calling upon the international 

community, including the Human Rights Council, to contribute towards achieving 

that goal, 

 Recognizing also that historical injustices, inter alia, have contributed to the 

poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion, economic disparity, 

instability and insecurity that affect many people in different parts of the world, in 

particular in developing countries,  

 Recognizing further that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, 

including extreme poverty, is one of the critical elements in the promotion and 

realization of the right to development and is the greatest global challenge and an 

indispensable requirement for sustainable development, which requires a 

multifaceted and integrated approach, and committed to achieving sustainable 

development in its three dimensions — economic, social and environmental — in a 

balanced and integrated manner, 

 Emphasizing that all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the 

right to development, are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated,  

 Emphasizing also that the right to development should be central to the 

implementation of the 2030 Agenda,  

 Recalling the appointment made by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 

33/14 of 29 September 2016, of a Special Rapporteur on the right to development, 

whose mandate should add value to the work of the Working Group on the Right to 

Development, while avoiding any duplication,
14

  

 Encouraging relevant bodies of the United Nations system, within their 

respective mandates, including the specialized agencies, funds and programmes of 

the United Nations system, relevant international organizations, including the World 

Trade Organization, and relevant stakeholders, including civil society organizations, 

to give due consideration to the right to development in the implementation of the 

2030 Agenda and to cooperate with the United Nations High Commissioner for 

Human Rights in the fulfilment of his mandate with regard to the implementation of 

the right to development,

High Commissioner concerning the promotion and realization of the right to 

development;
15

  

 2. Acknowledges the need to strive for greater acceptance, 

operationalization and realization of the right to development at the international 

level while urging all States to undertake at the national level the necessary policy

right to development as an integral part of all human rights and fundamental 

freedoms; 

 3. Emphasizes the relevant provisions of General Assembly resolution 

60/251 of 15 March 2006 establishing the Human Rights Council, and in this regard 

calls upon the Council to implement the agreement to continue to act to ensure that 

its agenda promotes and advances sustainable development, including the 2030 

Agenda for Sustainable Development,
5
 which seeks to build on the Millennium 

Development Goals and complete what they did not achieve, and also in this regard 

to lead the raising of the right to development, as set out in paragraphs 5 and 10 of 

the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action,
3
 to the same level as and on a par 

with all other human rights and fundamental freedoms;

 and recognizes the need for renewed efforts towards 

intensifying deliberations in the Working Group to fulfil its mandate at the earliest;  

 5. Reaffirms the recommendations adopted by the Working Group at its 

eighteenth session, and calls for their immediate, full and effective implementation

Working Group with a view to completing the tasks entrusted to it by the Human 

Rights Council in its resolution 4/4;
13

 

 6. Stresses that the views, criteria and corresponding operational 

subcriteria, once considered, revised and endorsed by the Working Group, should be 

used, as appropriate, in the elaboration of a comprehensive and coherent set of 

standards for the implementation of the right to development;  

 7. Emphasizes the importance of the Working Group taking appropriate 

steps to ensure respect for and the practical application of the above -mentioned 

standards, which could take various forms, including the elaboration of guidelines 

on the implementation of the right to development, and evolve into a basis for the 

consideration of an international legal standard of a binding nature through a 

collaborative process of engagement; 

 8. Calls upon Member States to contribute to the efforts of the Working 

Group, including by considering the proposed set of standards on the 

implementation and realization of the right to development, and in that context 

underscores the importance of finalizing the criteria and subcriteria of the right to 

development; 

 9. Stresses the importance of the core principles contained in the 

conclusions of the Working Group at its third session
17

 that are congruent with the 

purpose of international human rights instruments, such as equality,  

non-discrimination, accountability, participation and international cooperation, as

critical to mainstreaming the right to development at the national and international 

levels, and underlines the importance of the principles of equity and transparency;  

 10. Also stresses that it is important that the Chair-Rapporteur and the 

Working Group, in the discharge of their mandates, take into account the need:  

 (a) To promote the democratization of the system of international 

governance in order to increase the effective participation of developing countries in 

international decision-making; 

 (b) To also promote effective partnerships such as the New Partnership for 

Africa’s Development
12

 and other similar initiatives with the developing countries, 

particularly the least developed countries, for the purpose of the realization of their 

right to development, including the achievement of the Sustainable Development 

Goals; 

 (c) To strive for greater acceptance, operationalization and realization of the 

right to development at the international level, while urging all States to undertake 

at the national level the necessary policy formulation and to institute the measures 

required for the implementation of the right to development as an integral part of all 

human rights and fundamental freedoms, and also while urging all States to expand 

and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation in ensuring development and 

eliminating obstacles to development in the context of promoting effective 

international cooperation for the realization of the right to development, bearing in 

mind that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development 

requires effective development policies at the national level and a favourable 

economic environment at the international level;  

 (d) To consider ways and means to continue to ensure the operationalization 

of the right to development as a priority;  

 (e) To mainstream the right to development in the policies and operational 

activities of the specialized agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations 

system, as well as in the policies and strategies of the international financial and 

multilateral trading systems, bearing in mind in this regard that the core principles 

of the international economic, commercial and financial spheres, such as equity, 

non-discrimination, transparency, accountability, participation and international 

cooperation, including effective partnerships for development, are indispensable in 

achieving the right to development and preventing discriminatory treatment arising 

from political or other non-economic considerations in addressing the issues of 

concern to the developing countries;  

 11. Encourages the Human Rights Council to continue to consider how to 

ensure follow-up to the work of the former Subcommission on the Promotion and

Commission on Human Rights and in compliance with decisions to be taken by the 

Council; 

 12. Welcomes the first report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to

programmes of the United Nations system to provide the Special Rapporteur with 

all the assistance and support necessary for the fulfilment of his mandate;  

 14. Reaffirms the commitment to implement the goals and targets set out in 

all the outcome documents of the major United Nations conferences and summits 

and their review processes, in particular those relating to the realization of the right 

to development, recognizing that the realization of the right to development is 

critical to achieving the objectives, goals and targets set in those outcome 

documents; 

 15. Also reaffirms that the realization of the right to development is essential 

to the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which 

regards all human rights as universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, 

places the human person at the centre of development and recognizes that, while 

development facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights, a lack of development 

may not be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally recognized human 

rights; 

 16.  Affirms that development contributes significantly to the enjoyment of all 

human rights by all, and calls upon all countries to realize people -centred 

development of the people, by the people and for the people;  

 17.  Calls upon all States to spare no effort in promoting the right to 

development, in particular while implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

Development, as it is conducive to the overall enjoyment of human rights;  

 18. Stresses that the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection 

of all human rights lies with the State, and reaffirms that States have the primary 

responsibility for their own economic and social development and that the role of 

national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized; 

 19. Reaffirms the primary responsibility of States to create national and 

international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to development, as 

well as their commitment to cooperate with one another to that end;  

 20. Expresses concern about the increasing cases of human rights violations 

and abuses by some transnational corporations and other business enterprises, 

underlines the need to ensure that appropriate protection, justice and remedies are 

provided to the victims of human rights violations and abuses resulting from their 

activities, and underscores the fact that these entities must contribute to the means 

of implementation for the realization of the right to development;  

 21. Reaffirms the need for an international environment that is conducive to 

the realization of the right to development;  

 22. Emphasizes the critical importance of identifying and analysing obstacles 

impeding the full realization of the right to development at both the national and 

international levels; 

 23. Affirms that, while globalization offers both opportunities and 

challenges, the process of globalization remains deficient in achieving the 

objectives of integrating all countries into a globalized world, stresses the need for 

policies and measures at the national and global levels to respond to the challenges 

and opportunities of globalization if this process is to be made fully inclusive and 

equitable, recognizes that globalization has brought disparities between and within 

countries and that issues such as trade and trade liberalization, the transfer of 

technology, infrastructure development and market access should be managed 

effectively in order to mitigate the challenges of poverty and underdevelopment and 

to make the right to development a reality for everyone;  



A/C.3/72/L.26/Rev.1 
 

 

17-20118 8/10 

 

 24. Recognizes that, despite continuous efforts on the part of the 

international community, the gap between developed and developing countries 

remains unacceptably wide, that most of the developing countries continue to face 

difficulties in participating in the globalization process and that many risk being 

marginalized and effectively excluded from its benefits;  

 25. Expresses its deep concern, in this regard, about the negative impact on 

the realization of the right to development due to the further aggravation of the 

economic and social situation, in particular of developing countries, as a result of 

the ongoing international energy, food and financial crises, as well as the increasing 

challenges posed by global climate change and the loss of biodiversity, which have 

increased vulnerabilities and inequalities and have adversely affected development 

gains, in particular in developing countries;  

 26. Encourages Member States to give particular consideration to the right to 

development in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda;  

 27. Recalls the commitment in the United Nations Millennium Declaration
4
 

of halving the number of people living in poverty by 2015, notes with concern that 

some developing countries have failed to achieve the Millennium Development 

Goals, and in this regard invites Member States and the international community to 

take proactive measures aimed at creating a conducive environment to co ntribute to 

the effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda, in particular increasing 

international cooperation, including partnership and commitment, between 

developed and developing countries towards achieving the Sustainable 

Development Goals; 

 28. Urges developed countries that have not yet done so to make concrete 

efforts towards meeting the targets of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for 

official development assistance to developing countries and 0.15 to 0.2 per cent of 

their gross national product to the least developed countries, and encourages 

developing countries to build on the progress achieved in ensuring that official 

development assistance is used effectively to help to meet development goals and 

targets; 

 29. Recognizes the need to address market access for developing countries, 

including in the sectors of agriculture, services and non -agricultural products, in 

particular those of interest to developing countries;  

 30. Calls once again for the implementation of a desirable pace of 

meaningful trade liberalization, including in areas under negotiation in the World 

Trade Organization, the implementation of commitments on implementation -related 

issues and concerns, a review of special and differential treatment provisions, with a 

view to strengthening them and making them more precise, effective and 

operational, the avoidance of new forms of protectionism, and capacity -building and 

technical assistance for developing countries as important issues in making progress 

towards the effective implementation of the right to development;  

 31. Recognizes the important link between the international economic, 

commercial and financial spheres and the realization of the right to development, 

stresses in this regard the need for good governance and for broadening the base of 

decision-making at the international level on issues of development concern and the 

need to fill organizational gaps, as well as to strengthen the United Nations system 

and other multilateral institutions, and also stresses the need to broaden and
