United Nations,5

International Court of Justice on the legal consequences of the construction of a wall 
in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,7 and noting in particular the reply of the Court, 
including on the right of peoples to self-determination, which is a right erga 
omnes,8  

 Recalling the conclusion of the Court, in its advisory opinion of 9 July 2004, 
that the construction of the wall by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, along with measures previously 
taken, severely impedes the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination,9

process, based on the relevant resolutions of the United Nations, the Madrid terms 
of reference, including the principle of land for peace, the Arab Peace Initiative10 
and the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict,11 and stressing the need to accelerate the negotiations, within the agreed 
time frame of nine months, for the achievement of a just, lasting and comprehensive 
peace settlement between the Palestinian and Israeli sides, 

 Stressing the need for respect for and preservation of the territorial unity, 
contiguity and integrity of all of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 
Jerusalem, and recalling in this regard its resolution 58/292 of 6 May 2004, 

 Recalling its resolution 67/158 of 20 December 2012, 

 Taking note of its resolution 67/19 of 29 November 2012, 

 Affirming the right of all States in the region to live in peace within secure and 
internationally recognized borders, 

 1. Reaffirms the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, 
including the right to their independent State of Palestine; 

 2. Urges all States and the specialized agencies and organizations of the 
United Nations system to continue to support and assist the Palestinian people in the 
early realization of their right to self-determination.
