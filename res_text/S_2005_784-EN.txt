draft resolution

The Security Council,

Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 29 November 2005
(S/2005/743) on the United Nations operation in Cyprus,

Reiterating its call to the parties to assess and address the humanitarian issue
of missing persons with due urgency and seriousness, and welcoming in this regard
the resumption of the activities of the Committee on Missing Persons since August
2004, as well as the Secretary-General’s intention to appoint a Third Member as of
January 2006 and to reinforce his office,

Noting that the Government of Cyprus is agreed that in view of the prevailing
conditions in the island it is necessary to keep UNFICYP beyond 15 December
2005,

Taking note of the assessment of the Secretary-General that the security
situation on the island continues to be stable and that the situation along the Green
Line remains calm, welcoming in this context the further decrease in the overall
number of incidents involving the two sides, while noting nonetheless that there
were incidents of significant concern,

Urging both sides to avoid any action which could lead to an increase in
tension and taking note with concern, in this context, of the conduct, for the first
time since 2001, of the “Nikiforos” military exercise, and, afterwards, the “Toros”
military exercise,

Regretting that progress towards a political solution has been negligible at best
and urging both sides to work towards the resumption of negotiations for a
comprehensive settlement,

Welcoming the Secretary-General’s continuous engagement in the search for a
comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem,

Welcoming all demining activity in the buffer zone, including the agreement to
begin the clearing of Turkish Forces minefields in Nicosia and surrounding areas
within the buffer zone,

Expressing concern that, since the release of the Secretary-General’s report,
differences have arisen over construction activity related to the proposed additional

crossing point at Ledra Street and urging both sides to cooperate with UNFICYP to
resolve this issue,

Welcoming the Secretary-General’s intention to keep the operations of
UNFICYP under close review continuing to take into account developments on the
ground and the views of the parties, and to revert to the Council with
recommendations as appropriate for further adjustments to UNFICYP’s mandate,
force levels and concept of operation as soon as warranted,

Welcoming the fact that over nine million crossings by Greek Cypriots to the
north and Turkish Cypriots to the south have taken place, and encouraging the
opening of additional crossing points,

Welcoming all efforts to promote bicommunal contacts and events, including,
inter alia, on the part of the United Nations, and urging the two sides to promote
further bicommunal contacts and to remove any obstacles to such contacts,

Echoing the Secretary-General’s gratitude to the Government of Cyprus and
the Government of Greece for their voluntary contributions to the funding of
UNFICYP, and his request for further voluntary contributions from other countries
and organizations,

Welcoming and encouraging efforts by the United Nations to sensitize
peacekeeping personnel in the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS and other
communicable diseases in all its peacekeeping operations,

1. Reaffirms all its relevant resolutions on Cyprus, in particular resolution
1251 (1999) of 29 June 1999 and subsequent resolutions;

2. Expresses its full support for UNFICYP and decides to extend its
mandate for a further period ending 15 June 2006;

3. Calls on the Turkish Cypriot side and Turkish forces to restore in
Strovilia the military status quo which existed there prior to 30 June 2000;

4. Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report on implementation of
this resolution by 1 June 2006;

5. Welcomes the efforts being undertaken by UNFICYP to implement the
Secretary-General’s zero tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and to
ensure full compliance of its personnel with the United Nations code of conduct,
requests the Secretary-General to continue to take all necessary action in this regard
and to keep the Security Council informed, and urges troop-contributing countries to
take appropriate preventive action including the conduct of pre-deployment
awareness training, and to take disciplinary action and other action to ensure full
accountability in cases of such conduct involving their personnel;

6. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
