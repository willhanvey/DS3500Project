regard to improving the situation of women, and notes the ongoing discussions 

regarding the comprehensive bill on ensuring the protection of women against

Iranian citizenship for their children under the age of 18 years;  

 7. Welcomes the adoption of a bill to protect children and adolescents, noting

domestic and intimate partner violence during the COVID-19 outbreak, through 

awareness-raising actions and hotlines, and in this regard notes initiatives focused on

3/7 20-15034 

 

the Islamic Republic of Iran, in violation of its international obligations, including

or vaguely defined, in violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political

safeguards, including executions undertaken without prior notification of the 

prisoner’s family members or legal counsel, as required by Iranian law, and calls upon 

the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to abolish, in law and in practice, 

public executions, which are contrary to the 2008 directive seeking to end this 

practice issued by the former head of the judiciary, and to consider establishing a 

moratorium on executions; 

 13. Also expresses serious concern at the continued imposition of the death

Convention on the Rights of the Child, 7  and to commute the sentences for child 

offenders on death row; 

 14. Calls upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to ensure, in law and in practice, 

that no one is subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 

punishment, which may include sexual violence, and punishments that are grossly 

disproportionate to the nature of the offence, in conformity with amendments to the 

Penal Code, the constitutional guarantees of the Islamic Republic of Iran and 

international obligations and standards, including but not limited to the United 

Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela 

Rules), 8  and to ensure that allegations of torture are promptly and impartially 

investigated; 

 15. Urges the Islamic Republic of Iran to cease the widespread and systematic 

use of arbitrary arrests and detention, including the continued use of this practice to 

target dual and foreign nationals, and the practices of enforced disappearance and 

incommunicado detention, to release those who have been arbitrarily detained and to 

account for the fate or whereabouts of those subjected to enforced disappearance, and 

to uphold, in law and in practice, procedural guarantees to ensure fair trial standards, 

including timely access to legal representation of one’s choice, in a language that the 

accused speaks and understands, from the time of arrest through all stages of trial and 

all appeals, the right not to be subjected to torture, cruel and inhuman or degrading 

treatment or punishment and consideration of bail and other reasonable terms for 

release from custody pending trial, and calls upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to

involved in peaceful protests, to consider rescinding unduly harsh sentences, 

including those involving the death penalty and long-term internal exile, and to end 

reprisals against human rights defenders, peaceful protesters and their families,
