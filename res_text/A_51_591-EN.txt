Taking note of the report of the Commissioner-General of the United Nations

Welcoming the signature by the Government of the State of Israel in
Washington on 13 September 1993 and the Palestine Liberation Organization, the
representative of the people of Palestine, of the Declaration of Principles on
Interim Self-Government Arrangements4 and the subsequent implementation
agreements, as also the signature of the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip in Washington on 28 September 1995,

Encouraging the Multilateral Working Group on Refugees of the Middle East
peace process to continue its important work,

Welcoming the completion of the transfer of the headquarters on the Agency
to its area of operations,

1. Notes with regret that repatriation or compensation of the refugees,
as provided for in paragraph 11 of its resolution 194 (III), has not yet been
effected and that, therefore, the situation of the refugees continues to be a
matter of concern;

2. Expresses its thanks to the Commissioner-General and to all the staff
of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near
East, recognizing that the Agency is doing all it can within the limits of
available resources, and also expresses its thanks to the specialized agencies
and to private organizations for their valuable work in assisting refugees;

3. Notes with regret that the United Nations Conciliation Commission for
Palestine has been unable to find a means of achieving progress in the
implementation of paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III),5 and
requests the Commission to exert continued efforts towards the implementation of
that paragraph and to report to the Assembly as appropriate, but not later than
1 September 1997;

4. Notes the significant success of the peace implementation programme of
the Agency since the signing of the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-
Government Arrangements, and stresses the importance that contributions to this
programme are not at the expense of the General Fund;

5. Welcomes strengthened cooperation between the Agency and the World
Bank and other specialized agencies, and calls upon the Agency to make a
decisive contribution towards giving a fresh impetus to the economic and social
stability of the occupied territories;

a view to the economic and social development of the Palestinian people and the

7. Reiterates its concern regarding the continuing seriousness of the
financial position of the Agency, as outlined in the report of the Commissioner-
General;

8. Commends the efforts of the Commissioner-General to move towards
budgetary transparency and internal efficiency, and hopes that such moves will
continue;

9. Notes with profound concern that the structural deficit problem
confronting the Agency portends an almost certain decline in the living
conditions of the Palestine refugees and that it, therefore, has possible
consequences for the peace process;

10. Calls upon all Governments, as a matter of urgency, to make the most
generous efforts possible to meet the anticipated needs of the Agency, including
the costs of moving the headquarters to Gaza, urges non-contributing Governments
to contribute regularly and encourages contributing Governments to consider
increasing their regular contributions.
