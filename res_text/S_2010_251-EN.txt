 Reiterating its concern at the humanitarian and security repercussions in 
eastern Chad and the north-eastern Central African Republic of the ongoing violence 
in Darfur,  

 Concerned at armed activities and banditry in eastern Chad, the north-eastern 
Central African Republic and western Sudan which threaten the security of the 
civilian population, the conduct of humanitarian operations in those areas and the 
stability of those countries, and which result in serious violations of human rights 
and international humanitarian law, 

 Welcoming the signature on 15 January 2010 by the Governments of Chad and 
Sudan of an agreement to normalize their bilateral relations, as well as the 
deployment by the Governments of Chad and Sudan of a joint force under a joint 
command along their common border with a view to denying the cross-border 
movement of armed elements and stemming their criminal activities, 

 Stressing that a proper settlement of the Darfur issue, including through the 
Doha peace process, the full implementation of the Sirte and Libreville agreements 
and the efforts of national political dialogue in Chad and the Central African 
Republic, will contribute to long-term peace and stability in the region and to the 
voluntary, secure and sustainable return of refugees and internally displaced 
persons, 

 Stressing also the importance of achieving dignified durable solutions for 
refugees and internally displaced persons, notably voluntary, safe orderly return and 
sustainable reintegration, 

 Reiterating its full support for the efforts of the Secretary-General, the African 
Union, other international and regional actors to find solutions to armed conflicts in

towns, refugee camps and IDP sites and noting that the DIS provides community
