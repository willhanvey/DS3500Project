 Recalling that the Central African Republic bears the primary responsibility to

cleansing and crimes against humanity,  

 Emphasizing that any sustainable solution to the crisis in the CAR should be 

CAR-owned, including the political and reconciliation process, and calling upon the

 Calling upon the elected authorities to urgently implement transparent and 

inclusive measures that allow for stabilization and reconciliation in the CAR,

 Commending the United Nations Integrated Multidimensional Mission in the 

CAR (MINUSCA) and the French forces for the ongoing work to help the 

Transitional authorities improve the security situation; noting also with concern, 

however, that while improving, security in the CAR remains fragile,  

 Welcoming the work done by the European Union military advice mission 

based in Bangui (EUMAM-RCA), as requested by the CAR transitional authorities, 

in order to contribute to providing them with expert advice on reforming the CAR 

Armed Forces (FACA) into a multi-ethnic, professional, and republican security 

services,  

 Calling upon the transitional authorities and subsequent elected authorities of 

the CAR to ensure that perpetrators of violations of applicable international law, 

including those committed against children and women, are excluded from the CAR 

security and armed forces,  

 Welcoming the commitment of the Secretary-General to enforce strictly his 

zero-tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse, expressing grave concern 

over numerous allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse reportedly committed by 

peacekeepers in the CAR, stressing the urgent need for troop - and police-

contributing countries and MINUSCA to promptly investigate those cases in a 

credible and transparent manner and to hold accountable those responsible for such 

criminal offenses or misconduct, and further stressing the need to prevent such 

exploitation and abuse and to improve how these allegations are addressed,  

 Welcoming the United Nations Secretary-General Report of 30 November 2015 

(S/2015/918) submitted pursuant to resolution 2217 (2015),  

 Welcoming also the midterm update and the final report (S/2015/936) of the 

Panel of Experts on the Central African Republic established pursuant to resolution 

2127 (2013), expanded by resolution 2134 (2014) and extended pursuant to 

resolution 2196 (2015), and taking note of the Panel of Experts’ recommendations,  

 Strongly condemning the upsurge of violence and instability in the Central 

African Republic (CAR), in particular in September and October 2015, and the 

threats of violence, human rights violations and abuses and international 

humanitarian law violations, including against women and children; the attacks 

against United Nations peacekeepers, international forces and humanitarian 

personnel; the continuous cycle of provocations and reprisals by armed groups, both 

inside and outside of Bangui and denial of humanitarian access, committed by 

armed elements, which continue to adversely affect the dire humanitarian situation 

faced by the civilian population and to impede humanitarian access to vulnerable 

populations,  

 Reiterating that all perpetrators of such acts must be held accountable and that 

some of those acts may amount to crimes under the Rome Statute of the 

International Criminal Court (ICC), to which the CAR is a State party, noting in this 

regard the opening by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on 

24 September 2014 of an investigation following the request of the national 

authorities on alleged crimes committed since 2012 and welcoming the ongoing 

cooperation by the CAR Transitional Authorities in this regard,

violations or abuses of human rights, underlining in this regard the need to bolster 

national accountability mechanisms and to further implement without delay the 

7 August 2014 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Urgent Temporary 

Measures, and the law promulgated in June 2015 to establish a national Special 

Criminal Court to investigate and prosecute serious crimes committed in the CAR, 

including by recruiting the necessary local and international staff,  

 Emphasizing that those engaging in or providing support for acts that 

undermine undermining the peace, stability or security of the CAR, threatening or 

impeding the transition process, or the political stabilization and reconciliation 

process, targeting of civilians and attacking peacekeepers may meet criteria for 

designation under sanctions as stated in this resolution,  

 Expressing grave concern at the findings of the Panel of Experts’ final report 

of 21 December 2015 (S/2015/936) that armed groups continue to destabilize the 

CAR and to pose a permanent threat to the peace, security and stability of the 

country, including through the establishment of illegitimate parallel administrations,  

 Expressing concern that illicit trafficking, trade, exploitation and smuggling of 

natural resources including gold, diamonds and wildlife has a negative impact in the 

economy and the development of the country, and that it continues to threaten the 

peace and stability of CAR,  

 Taking note of the Kimberley Process (KP) Administrative Decision on 

Resumption of Exports of Rough Diamonds from the CAR, its annexed Operational 

Framework, and the establishment of the KP Monitoring Team for CAR and 

recognizing the extraordinary efforts of the CAR transitional authorities and the KP, 

under the 2015 Chairmanship of Angola, to responsibly reintegrate CAR into the 

global diamond trade, 

 Noting with concern the findings of the Panel of Experts’ final report that the 

Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) remains active in the CAR, has established links to 

other armed groups and is generating revenues from the exploitation and trade of 

natural resources, including gold, diamonds and wildlife poaching,  

 Noting with concern the ongoing transnational criminal activity in the region, 

emphasizing the risk of the situation in the CAR providing a conducive environment 

for further transnational criminal activity, such as that involving arms trafficking 

and the use of mercenaries as well as a potential breeding ground for radical 

networks,  

 Acknowledging in this respect the important contribution the Council -

mandated arms embargo can make to countering the illici t transfer of arms and 

related materiel in the CAR and its region, and in supporting post -conflict 

peacebuilding, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and security sector 

reform, recalling its resolutions 2117 (2013), 2127 (2013) and 2220 (2015) and 

expressing grave concern at the threat to peace and security in the CAR arising from 

the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light 

weapons, and the use of such weapons against civilians affected by armed conflict,  

 Recalling the need for an inclusive and effective disarmament, demobilization 

and reintegration process (DDR) as well as repatriation and resettlement (DDRRR) 

in the case of foreign fighters, including children formerly associated with armed 

forces and groups, while respecting the need to fight impunity,

individuals and entities designated by the Sanctions Committee established pursuant 

to resolution 2127 (2013) and underlining that individuals who knowingly facilitate 

the travel of a listed individual in violation of the travel ban may be determined by 

the Committee to have met the designation criteria for sanctions,  

 Noting the critical importance of effective implementation of the sanctions 

regime, including the key role that neighbouring States, as well as regional and 

subregional organizations, can play in this regard and encouraging efforts to further 

enhance cooperation and implementation of the sanctions regime in all its aspects,  

 Noting with concern the reports that sanctioned individuals are travelling in 

the region in violation of the travel ban, and underlining that individuals or entities
