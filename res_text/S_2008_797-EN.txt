  United States of America: draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions and statements by its President on the 
situation in Liberia and West Africa, 

 Welcoming the sustained progress made by the Government of Liberia since 
January 2006, in rebuilding Liberia for the benefit of all Liberians, with the support 
of the international community, 

 Recalling its decision not to renew the measures in paragraph 10 of resolution 
1521 (2003) regarding round log and timber products originating in Liberia, and 
stressing that Liberia’s progress in the timber sector must continue with the effective 
implementation and enforcement of the National Forestry Reform Law signed into 
law on 5 October 2006, including the resolution of land and tenure rights, the 
conservation and protection of biodiversity, and the process for the awarding of 
contracts for commercial forestry operations,  

 Recalling its decision to terminate the measures in paragraph 6 of resolution 
1521 (2003) regarding diamonds, and welcoming the Government of Liberia’s 
participation in the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, noting Liberia’s 
implementation of the necessary internal controls and other requirements of the 
Kimberley Process, and calling on the Government of Liberia to continue to work 
diligently to ensure the effectiveness of these controls, 

 Recalling the statement of its President on 25 June 2007 (S/PRST/2007/22) 
recognizing the role of voluntary initiatives aimed at improving revenue 
transparency such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and 
noting General Assembly resolution 62/274 on strengthening transparency in 
industries, supports Liberia’s decision to inter alia take part in EITI and other 
extractive industry transparency initiatives and encourages Liberia’s continued 
progress in implementing their EITI work plan to improve revenue transparency, 

 Stressing the continuing importance of the United Nations Mission in Liberia 
(UNMIL) in improving security through Liberia and helping the Government 
establish its authority throughout the country, particularly in the diamond, timber, 
and other natural resources-producing regions, and border areas, 

 Taking note of the report of the United Nations Panel of Experts on Liberia 
dated 16 December 2008 (S/2008/785), including on the issues of diamonds, timber, 
targeted sanctions, and arms and security, 



S/2008/797  
 

08-66340 2 
 

 Having reviewed the measures imposed by paragraphs 2 and 4 of resolution 
1521 (2003) and paragraph 1 of resolution 1532 (2004) and the progress towards 
meeting the conditions set out by paragraph 5 of resolution 1521 (2003), and 
concluding that insufficient progress has been made towards that end, 

 Underlining its determination to support the Government of Liberia in its 
efforts to meet those conditions, and encouraging donors to do likewise,  

 Urging all parties to support the Government of Liberia in identifying and 
implementing measures that will ensure progress towards meeting the conditions set 
out by paragraph 5 of resolution 1521 (2003),

the region,
