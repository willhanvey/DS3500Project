 Recognizing the universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated 
character of all human rights, and in this regard reaffirming the right to development 
as an integral part of all human rights, 

 Recalling the final document of the Fifteenth Summit Conference of the Heads 
of State and Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, held in 
Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in July 20095 and those adopted in previous summits and 
conferences, in which States Members of the Movement agreed to oppose and 
condemn those measures or laws and their continued application, persevere with 
efforts to effectively reverse them and urge other States to do likewise, as called for 
by the General Assembly and other United Nations organs, and request States 
applying those measures or laws to revoke them fully and immediately, 

 Recalling also that at the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna 
from 14 to 25 June 1993, States were called upon to refrain from any unilateral 
measure not in accordance with international law and the Charter that creates 
obstacles to trade relations among States and impedes the full realization of all 
human rights,6 and also severely threatens the freedom of trade,  

 Bearing in mind all the references to this question in the Copenhagen 
Declaration on Social Development adopted by the World Summit for Social 
Development on 12 March 1995,7 the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action 
adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women on 15 September 1995,8 the 
Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements and the Habitat Agenda adopted by the 
second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) on 14 June 
1996,9 and their five-year reviews, 

 Expressing concern about the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures 
on international relations, trade, investment and cooperation, 

 Expressing grave concern that, in some countries, the situation of children is 
adversely affected by unilateral coercive measures not in accordance with 
international law and the Charter that create obstacles to trade relations among 
States, impede the full realization of social and economic development and hinder 
the well-being of the population in the affected countries, with particular 
consequences for women and children, including adolescents, 

 Deeply concerned that, despite the recommendations adopted on this question 
by the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council, the Commission on Human 
Rights and recent major United Nations conferences, and contrary to general 
international law and the Charter, unilateral coercive measures continue to be 
promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the social 
humanitarian activities and economic and social development of developing 
countries, including their extraterritorial effects, thereby creating additional

obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals under 
the jurisdiction of other States, 

 Bearing in mind all the extraterritorial effects of any unilateral legislative, 
administrative and economic measures, policies and practices of a coercive nature 
against the development process and the enhancement of human rights in 
developing countries, which create obstacles to the full realization of all human 
rights, 

 Reaffirming that unilateral coercive measures are a major obstacle to the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development,10  

 Recalling article 1, paragraph 2, common to the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights11 and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights,11 which provides, inter alia, that in no case may a people be 
deprived of its own means of subsistence, 

 Noting the continuing efforts of the open-ended Working Group on the Right 
to Development of the Human Rights Council, and reaffirming in particular its 
criteria, according to which unilateral coercive measures are one of the obstacles to 
the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development,  

 1. Urges all States to cease adopting or implementing any unilateral 
measures not in accordance with international law, the Charter of the United Nations 
and the norms and principles governing peaceful relations among States, in 
particular those of a coercive nature with all their extraterritorial effects, which 
create obstacles to trade relations among States, thus impeding the full realization of 
the rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights12 and other 
international human rights instruments, in particular the right of individuals and 
peoples to development;  

 2. Also urges all States not to adopt any unilateral measures not in 
accordance with international law and the Charter that impede the full achievement 
of economic and social development by the population of the affected countries, in 
particular children and women, that hinder their well-being and that create obstacles 
to the full enjoyment of their human rights, including the right of everyone to a 
standard of living adequate for his or her health and well-being and his or her right 
to food, medical care and the necessary social services, as well as to ensure that 
food and medicine are not used as tools for political pressure; 

 3. Strongly objects to the extraterritorial nature of those measures which, in 
addition, threaten the sovereignty of States, and in this context calls upon all 
Member States to neither recognize those measures nor to apply them, as well as to 
take administrative or legislative measures, as appropriate, to counteract the 
extraterritorial applications or effects of unilateral coercive measures;  

 4. Condemns the continued unilateral application and enforcement by 
certain Powers of unilateral coercive measures, and rejects those measures with all 
their extraterritorial effects as being tools for political or economic pressure against 
any country, in particular against developing countries, adopted with a view to 
preventing those countries from exercising their right to decide, of their own free

will, their own political, economic and social systems, and because of the negative 
effects of those measures on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of 
their populations, in particular children, women and the elderly; 

 5. Reaffirms that essential goods such as food and medicines should not be 
used as tools for political coercion and that under no circumstances should people 
be deprived of their own means of subsistence and development;  

 6. Calls upon Member States that have initiated such measures to abide by 
the principles of international law, the Charter, the declarations of the United 
Nations and world conferences and relevant resolutions and to commit themselves 
to their obligations and responsibilities arising from the international human rights 
instruments to which they are party by revoking such measures at the earliest 
possible time; 

 7. Reaffirms, in this context, the right of all peoples to self-determination, 
by virtue of which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their 
economic, social and cultural development; 

 8. Recalls that, according to the Declaration on Principles of International 
Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance 
with the Charter of the United Nations, contained in the annex to General Assembly 
resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970, and the relevant principles and 
provisions contained in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States 
proclaimed by the Assembly in its resolution 3281 (XXIX), in particular article 32 
thereof, no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other 
type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination 
of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind;  

 9. Rejects all attempts to introduce unilateral coercive measures, and urges 
the Human Rights Council to take fully into account the negative impact of those 
measures, including through the enactment of national laws and their extraterritorial 
application which are not in conformity with international law, in its task concerning 
the implementation of the right to development; 

 10. Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in 
discharging her functions relating to the promotion, realization and protection of the 
right to development and bearing in mind the continuing impact of unilateral 
coercive measures on the population of developing countries, to give priority to the 
present resolution in her annual report to the General Assembly; 

 11. Underlines that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major 
obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development,10 
and in this regard calls upon all States to avoid the unilateral imposition of 
economic coercive measures and the extraterritorial application of domestic laws 
that run counter to the principles of free trade and hamper the development of 
developing countries, as recognized by the Working Group on the Right to 
Development; 

 12. Recognizes that, in the Declaration of Principles adopted at the first 
phase of the World Summit on the Information Society, held in Geneva from 10 to 
12 December 2003,13 States were strongly urged to avoid and refrain from any

unilateral measure not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the 
United Nations in building the information society;  

 13. Supports the invitation of the Human Rights Council to all special 
rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the Council in the field of 
economic, social and cultural rights to pay due attention, within the scope of their 
respective mandates, to the negative impact and consequences of unilateral coercive 
measures; 

 14. Requests the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the 
attention of all Member States, to continue to collect their views and information on 
the implications and negative effects of unilateral coercive measures on their 
populations and to submit an analytical report thereon to the General Assembly at its 
sixty-fifth session, while reiterating once again the need to highlight the practical 
and preventive measures in this respect; 

 15. Decides to examine the question on a priority basis at its sixty-fifth 
session under the sub-item entitled “Human rights questions, including alternative 
approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms”.
