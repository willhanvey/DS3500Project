recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the following draft resolution:

Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized
agencies and the international institutions associated with the
United Nations

The General Assembly,

Having considered the item entitled “Implementation of the Declaration on the
Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized
agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations”,

Having also considered the report of the Secretary-General on the item,1

Having examined the chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the
Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples relating to the item,2

Recalling its resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 and 1541 (XV) of
15 December 1960 and the resolutions of the Special Committee, as well as other
relevant resolutions and decisions, including in particular Economic and Social
Council resolution 2002/30 of 25 July 2002,

Bearing in mind the relevant provisions of the final documents of the
successive Conferences of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries
and of the resolutions adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government
of the African Union, the Pacific Islands Forum and the Caribbean Community,

Conscious of the need to facilitate the implementation of the Declaration on
the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in
resolution 1514 (XV),

Noting that the large majority of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories
are small island Territories,

Welcoming the assistance extended to Non-Self-Governing Territories by
certain specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, in
particular the United Nations Development Programme,

Also welcoming the current participation in the capacity of observers of those
Non-Self-Governing Territories that are associate members of regional commissions
in the world conferences in the economic and social sphere, subject to the rules of
procedure of the General Assembly and in accordance with relevant United Nations
resolutions and decisions, including resolutions and decisions of the Assembly and
the Special Committee on specific Territories,

A/58/478

Noting that only some specialized agencies and other organizations of the
United Nations system have been involved in providing assistance to Non-Self-
Governing Territories,

Stressing that, because the development options of the small island Non-Self-
Governing Territories are limited, there are special challenges to planning for and
implementing sustainable development and that those Territories will be constrained
in meeting the challenges without the continuing cooperation and assistance of the
specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system,

Stressing also the importance of securing the necessary resources for funding
expanded programmes of assistance for the peoples concerned and the need to enlist
the support of all major funding institutions within the United Nations system in that
regard,

Reaffirming the mandates of the specialized agencies and other organizations
of the United Nations system to take all appropriate measures, within their
respective spheres of competence, to ensure the full implementation of General
Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant resolutions,

Expressing its appreciation to the African Union, the Pacific Islands Forum,
the Caribbean Community and other regional organizations for the continued
cooperation and assistance they have extended to the specialized agencies and other
organizations of the United Nations system in this regard,

Expressing its conviction that closer contacts and consultations between and
among the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations
system and regional organizations help to facilitate the effective formulation of
programmes of assistance to the peoples concerned,

Mindful of the imperative need to keep under continuous review the activities
of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system in
the implementation of the various United Nations decisions relating to
decolonization,

Bearing in mind the extremely fragile economies of the small island Non-Self-
Governing Territories and their vulnerability to natural disasters, such as hurricanes,
cyclones and sea-level rise, and recalling the relevant resolutions of the General
Assembly,

Recalling General Assembly resolution 57/133 of 11 December 2002 on the
implementation of the Declaration by the specialized agencies and the international
institutions associated with the United Nations,

1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;1

(XV), and other relevant resolutions of the United Nations;

3. Reaffirms that the specialized agencies and other organizations and
institutions of the United Nations system should continue to be guided by the

resolutions;

4. Reaffirms also that the recognition by the General Assembly, the Security
Council and other United Nations organs of the legitimacy of the aspirations of the
peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories to exercise their right to self-
determination entails, as a corollary, the extension of all appropriate assistance to
those peoples;

5. Expresses its appreciation to those specialized agencies and other
organizations of the United Nations system that have continued to cooperate with
the United Nations and the regional and subregional organizations in the
implementation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant
resolutions of the United Nations, and requests all the specialized agencies and other
organizations of the United Nations system to implement the relevant provisions of
those resolutions;

6. Requests the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United
Nations system and international and regional organizations to examine and review
conditions in each Territory so as to take appropriate measures to accelerate progress
in the economic and social sectors of the Territories;

7. Urges those specialized agencies and organizations of the United Nations
system that have not yet provided assistance to Non-Self-Governing Territories to do
so as soon as possible;

8. Requests the specialized agencies and other organizations and institutions
of the United Nations system and regional organizations to strengthen existing
measures of support and formulate appropriate programmes of assistance to the
remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories, within the framework of their respective
mandates, in order to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of those
Territories;

9. Requests the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United

other organizations of the United Nations system formulate, with the active
cooperation of the regional organizations concerned, concrete proposals for the full
implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the
proposals to their governing and legislative organs;

11. Also recommends that the specialized agencies and other organizations of
the United Nations system continue to review at the regular meetings of their



7

A/58/478

governing bodies the implementation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)
and other relevant resolutions of the United Nations;

and/or strengthen disaster preparedness and management institutions and policies;

14. Requests the administering Powers concerned to facilitate, when
appropriate, the participation of appointed and elected representatives of Non-Self-
Governing Territories in the relevant meetings and conferences of the specialized
agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, in accordance with
relevant United Nations resolutions and decisions, including resolutions and
decisions of the General Assembly and the Special Committee on the Situation with
regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to
Colonial Countries and Peoples on specific Territories, so that the Territories may
benefit from the related activities of those agencies and organizations;

15. Recommends that all Governments intensify their efforts in the
specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system of which
they are members to accord priority to the question of providing assistance to the
peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories;

16. Requests the Secretary-General to continue to assist the specialized
agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system in working out
appropriate measures for implementing the relevant resolutions of the United
Nations and to prepare for submission to the relevant bodies, with the assistance of
