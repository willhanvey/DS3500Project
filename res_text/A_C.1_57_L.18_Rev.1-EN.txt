General and complete disarmament

The Netherlands: revised draft resolution

National legislation on transfer of arms, military equipment and
dual use goods and technology

The General Assembly,

Recognizing that disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation are essential
for the maintenance of international peace and security and that an effective national
control over the transfer of arms, military equipment and dual use goods and
technology is an important tool in achieving these objectives,

Recalling that the States parties to the international disarmament and non-
proliferation treaties have undertaken, inter alia, both to control transfers that could
contribute to proliferation activities and to facilitate the fullest possible exchange of
materials, equipment and technological information for peaceful purposes in
accordance with the provisions of those treaties,

Considering that the exchange of national legislation, regulations and
procedures on the transfer of arms, military equipment and dual use goods and
technology contributes to mutual understanding and confidence among Member
States,

Convinced that such an exchange would be beneficial to Member States that
are in the process of developing such legislation,

Reaffirming the inherent right to individual or collective self-defence in
accordance with article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations,

1. Invites Member States that are in a position to do so, to enact or improve
national legislation, regulations and procedures to exercise effective control over the
transfer of arms, military equipment and dual use goods and technology, while
ensuring that such legislation, regulations and procedures are consistent with States
parties’ obligations under international treaties;

* Reissued for technical reasons.

A/C.1/57/L.18/Rev.1

2. Encourages Member States to provide, on a voluntary basis, information
to the Secretary-General on their national legislation, regulations and procedures on
the transfer of arms, military equipment and dual use goods and technology, as well
as the changes therein, and requests the Secretary-General to make this information
accessible for Member States;

3. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-eighth session an
item entitled “National legislation on transfer of arms, military equipment and dual
use goods and technology”.
