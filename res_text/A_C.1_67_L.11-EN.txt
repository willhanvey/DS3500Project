 The General Assembly, 

 Guided by the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the 
United Nations, and reaffirming its respect for and commitment to international law,  

 Recalling its resolutions 46/36 L of 9 December 1991, 51/45 N of 
10 December 1996, 51/47 B of 10 December 1996, 56/24 V of 24 December 2001,

24 December 2008 and 64/48 of 2 December 2009, and its decision 66/518 of 
2 December 2011, 

 Expressing disappointment that the United Nations Conference on the Arms 
Trade Treaty convened from 2 to 27 July 2012 was unable to conclude its work to 
elaborate a legally binding instrument on the highest possible common international 
standards for the international transfer of conventional arms,  

 Noting that the draft text of the Arms Trade Treaty submitted by the President 
on 26 July 2012 contained in document A/CONF.217/CRP.1 reflects progress in the 
negotiations, while being mindful of requests by some States for further time to 
consider that document,  

 Determined to build on the progress made to date towards the adoption of a 
strong, balanced and effective Arms Trade Treaty, 

 1. Notes the report of the United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade 
Treaty as contained in document A/CONF.217/4;

procedure adopted on 3 July 2012 and contained in document A/CONF.217/L.1, in 



A/C.1/67/L.11  
 

12-55562 2 
 

order to finalize the elaboration of the Arms Trade Treaty, in an open and 
transparent manner, utilizing the modalities, applied mutatis mutandis, under which 
the United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty of 2 to 27 July 2012 
operated; 

 3. Also decides that the draft text of the Arms Trade Treaty submitted by the 
President of the United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty on 26 July

on the Arms Trade Treaty, without prejudice to the right of delegations to put 
forward additional proposals on that text; 

 4. Requests the Secretary-General to undertake consultations for the 
nomination of the President-designate of the Final United Nations Conference on 
the Arms Trade Treaty;

of the draft text of the Arms Trade Treaty submitted by the President of the 
United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty on 26 July 2012 contained in 
document A/CONF.217/CRP.1, prior to the Conference in 2013; 

 6. Requests the Secretary-General to render the Final United Nations 
Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty all necessary assistance, including the 
provision of essential background information and relevant documents, bearing in 
mind those made available to the United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade 
Treaty of 2 to 27 July 2012;  

 7. Decides to remain seized of the matter during its current session and in 
doing so calls on the President of the Conference to report on the outcome of the 
Final United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty to the General Assembly

 8. Also decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-eighth
