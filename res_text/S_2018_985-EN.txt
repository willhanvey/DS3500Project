(2018) (the Measures), and that the mandate of the Panel of Experts established by 

paragraph 24 of resolution 1973 (2011) and modified by resolutions 2040 (2012), 

2146 (2014), 2174 (2014), 2213 (2015) and 2278 (2016) was extended until 

15 November 2018 by resolution 2362 (2017), 

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territoria l 

integrity and national unity of Libya,  

 Recalling resolution 2259 (2015) which welcomed the signing of the 

17 December 2015 Libyan Political Agreement of Skhirat, Morocco and endorsed the 

Rome Communiqué of 13 December 2015 to support the Government of National 

Accord (GNA) as the sole legitimate government of Libya, that should be based in 

Tripoli, and further expressing its determination in this regard to support the 

Government of National Accord, 

 Welcoming endorsement in principle of the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) 

by the House of Representatives on 25 January 2016 and the subsequent meetings of 

the Libyan Political dialogue which reaffirmed its commitment to uphold the LPA, 

and reaffirming that the LPA remains the only viable framework to end the Libyan 

political crisis, and its implementation remains key to holding elections and finalising 

the political transition, 

 Underlining the primary responsibility of the GNA in taking appropriate action 

to prevent the illicit export of petroleum, including crude oil and refined petroleum 

products, from Libya and reaffirming the importance of international support for 

Libyan sovereignty over its territory and resources, 

 Expressing its concern that the illicit export of petroleum, including crude oil 

and refined petroleum products, from Libya undermines the Government of National 

Accord and poses a threat to the peace, security and stability of Libya, 

 Expressing support for Libyan efforts to resolve peacefully the disruptions of 

Libya’s energy exports and reiterating that control of all facilities should be 

transferred back to the proper authorities,

Statement of 19 July 2018 welcoming the announcement that Libya’s NOC had 

resumed its work on behalf, and for the benefit, of all Libyans, and stressing the need 

for the Government of National Accord to exercise sole and effective oversight over 

the National Oil Corporation, the Central Bank of Libya, and the  Libyan Investment 

Authority as a matter of urgency, without prejudice to future constitutional 

arrangements pursuant to the Libyan Political Agreement,  

 Further recalling resolution 2259 (2015) which called on Member States to 

cease support to and official contact with parallel institutions claiming to be the 

legitimate authority, but which were outside the Libyan Political Agreement, as 

specified by it, 

 Recalling that international law, as reflected in the United Nations Convention 

on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982, sets out the legal framework applicable 

to activities in the oceans and seas,  

 Further recalling resolutions 2292 (2016), 2357 (2017) and 2420 (2018) which 

in relation to the implementation of the arms embargo authorise, for the period of 

time specified by those resolutions, the inspection on the high seas off the coast of 

Libya of vessels bound to or from Libya believed to be carrying arms or related 

materiel in violation of relevant Security Council resolutions, and the seizure and 

disposal of such items provided that Member States make good faith efforts to first 

obtain the consent of the vessel’s flag State prior to any inspections while acting in 

accordance with those resolutions,

violations or abuses of human rights or violations of international humanitarian law,

transfer detainees to State authority,

line with Libyan priorities and in response to requests for assistance,
