20-14337 2/12 

 

 Recalling the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 

Cultural Rights,5 in which the fundamental right of every person to be free from 

hunger is recognized, 

 Bearing in mind the importance of the Rome Declaration on World Food 

Security, the World Food Summit Plan of Action and the Declaration of the World 

Food Summit: five years later, adopted in Rome on 13 June 2002,6 

 Reaffirming the importance of the recommendations contained in the Voluntary 

Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in 

the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and 

Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004,7 

 Acknowledging that the right to food has been recognized as the right of every 

individual, alone or in community with others, to have physical and economic access 

at all times to sufficient, adequate, nutritious food, in conformity with, inter alia, the 

culture, beliefs, traditions, dietary habits and preferences of individuals, that is 

produced and consumed sustainably, thereby preserving access to food for future 

generations, 

 Reaffirming the Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security 

contained in the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted in Rome 

on 16 November 2009,8 

 Recalling the proclamation by the General Assembly at its seventy-second 

session of 2019–2028 as the United Nations Decade of Family Farming and the close 

links between family farming, the promotion and conservation of historical, cultural 

and natural heritage, traditional customs and culture, halting the loss of biodiversity 

and the improvement of the living conditions of people living in rural areas,  

 Reaffirming that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 

interrelated and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the 

same footing and with the same emphasis,  

 Reaffirming also that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and 

economic environment, at both the national and the international levels, is the 

essential foundation that will enable States to give adequate priority to food security, 

improved nutrition and poverty eradication,  

 Reiterating, as set out in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security, the 

Declaration of the World Food Summit and the Rome Declaration on Nutrition, 9 that 

food should not be used as an instrument of political or economic pressure, and 

reaffirming in this regard the importance of international cooperation and solidarity, 

as well as the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures that are not in 

accordance with international law and the Charter and that endanger food  and 

nutrition security, 

 Expressing appreciation for the work of the United Nations system, in particular 

the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Food 

Programme, aimed at ending hunger and achieving food security and impr oved 

nutrition, 

 Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources 

and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations

contained in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food 

Summit Plan of Action, as well as in the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the 

Framework for Action,10 and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and 

internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food and 

nutrition security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and 

economies where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential,  

 Recognizing that, despite the efforts made and the fact that some positive results 

have been achieved, the problems of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition have a 

global dimension, that there has not been sufficient progress in reducing hunger and 

that these problems are increasing dramatically in some regions in the absence of 

urgent, determined and concerted action, 

 Recognizing also the importance of traditional sustainable agricultural 

practices, including traditional seed supply systems, as well as access to credit and 

other financial services, markets, secure land tenure, health care, social services, 

education, training, knowledge and appropriate and affordable technologies, 

including efficient irrigation, the reuse of treated wastewater and water harvesting 

and storage for indigenous peoples and others living in rural areas,  

 Recognizing further the complex character of food insecurity and its likely 

recurrence owing to a combination of several major factors, such as the effects of the 

global financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, desertification and 

the adverse impacts of climate change, as well as poverty, natural disasters, armed 

conflicts, drought, volatility in commodity prices and the lack in many countries of 

the appropriate technology, investment and capacity-building necessary to confront 

its impact, particularly in developing countries, including the least developed 

countries and small island developing States, and the need for coherence and 

collaboration between international institutions at the global level,  

 Noting with great concern that millions of people are facing famine or the 

immediate risk of famine or are experiencing severe food insecurity in several regions 

of the world, and noting also that poverty, armed conflicts, drought and the volatility 

of commodity prices are among the factors causing or exacerbating famine and severe 

food insecurity and that additional efforts, including international support, to respond, 

prevent and prepare for increasing global food insecurity are urgently needed,  

 Noting with great concern also the threat to human health, safety and well-being 

caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which continues to spread 

globally, as well as its unprecedented effects, including the severe disruption to 

societies and economies, and the devastating impact of the pandemic on, inter alia, 

the livelihoods of people, agriculture and food systems, value chains, food prices, 

nutrition and food security, 

 Recognizing that the poorest and those who may be vulnerable or in vulnerable 

situations are the hardest hit by the pandemic and that the impact of the crisis will 

reverse hard-won development gains and the fulfilment of the right to food for all, 

and hamper progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, 

including Goal 2, which aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved 

nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture,  

 Recognizing also that the COVID-19 global pandemic requires a global 

response based on unity, solidarity and multilateral cooperation,  

 Stressing the obligation of all States and parties to an armed conflict to protect 

civilians, in accordance with international humanitarian law, and calling upon 

Member States, the United Nations and other relevant organizations to take further

steps to provide a coordinated emergency response to the food and nutrition needs of  

affected populations, while aiming to ensure that such steps are supportive of national 

strategies and programmes aimed at improving food security and nutrition,  

 Reaffirming that starvation of civilians as a method of combat is prohibited 

under international humanitarian law and that it is therefore prohibited to attack, 

destroy, remove or render useless, for that purpose, objects indispensable to the 

survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the 

production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies 

and irrigation works, 

 Resolved to act to ensure that the promotion, protection and fulfilment of all 

human rights and the human rights perspective are taken into account at the national, 

regional and international levels in measures to address the realization of the right to 

food, 

 Stressing the possible benefits of international trade to improve food and 

nutrition availability, 

 Stressing also that improving access to productive resources and investment in 

rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in 

developing countries, through, inter alia, the promotion of investments in appropriate 

small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce 

vulnerability to droughts and tackle water scarcity, as well as in programmes, 

practices and policies to scale up sustainable agroecological approaches,  

 Expressing its deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters, 

diseases and pest infestations, as well as the negative impact of climate change, and 

their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in substantial loss of life 

and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food and nutrition security, 

in particular in developing countries,  

 Concerned that the adverse impacts of climate change and natural disasters are 

harming agricultural productivity, food production and cropping patterns, thus 

contributing to food availability shortfalls, and that such impacts are expected to 

increase with future climate change,  

 Expressing its deep concern over the negative effects of armed conflicts on the 

enjoyment of the right to food,  

 Emphasizing that a multisectoral approach that integrates nutrition across all 

sectors, including agriculture, health, water and sanitation, social protection and 

education, as well as a gender perspective, is critical to achieving global food security 

and improved nutrition and the realization of the right to food, 

 Recalling the endorsement of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible 

Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food 

Security11 by the Committee on World Food Security at its thirty-eighth session, held 

on 11 May 2012, and by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 

United Nations at its 144th session, 

 Recalling also the Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and 

Food Systems,12 which were endorsed by the Committee on World Food Security at 

its forty-first session, held from 13 to 18 October 2014,

of the United Nations in Rome from 19 to 21 November 2014, and of its outcome 

documents, the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the Framework for Action,  

 Stressing also the need to increase official development assistance devoted to 

sustainable agriculture and nutrition, 

 Recognizing that small and medium-sized farmers in developing countries need 

to receive technical, technology transfer and capacity-building support, 

 Recognizing also the importance of the protection and preservation of 

agrobiodiversity in guaranteeing food security and nutrition and the right to food for 

all, 

 Noting the cultural values of dietary and eating habits in different cultures, and 

recognizing that food plays an important role in defining the identity of individuals 

and communities and is a cultural component that describes and gives value to a 

territory and its inhabitants,  

 Recognizing the role of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 

Nations as the key United Nations agency for rural and agricultural development and 

its work in supporting the efforts of Member States to achieve the full realization of 

the right to food, including through its provision of technical assistance to developing 

countries in support of the implementation of national priority frameworks,  

 Recognizing also the role of the Committee on World Food Security as an 

inclusive international and intergovernmental platform for a broad range of 

committed stakeholders to work together in a coordinated manner and in support of 

country-led processes towards the elimination of hunger and ensuring food security 

and nutrition for all human beings,  

 Recalling the announcement by the Secretary-General, on 16 October 2019, of 

his intention to convene a world food systems summit in 2021, 

 Acknowledging the contribution of parliamentarians nationally and regionally 

to the reduction of hunger and malnutrition and ultimately to the realization of the 

right to food, and in this regard recognizing the convening of the first Global

 Recalling further the proclamation at its seventieth session of 2016–2025 as the 

United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition, and stressing the opportunity the 

Decade represents to bring together initiatives and efforts to eradicate hunger and 

prevent all forms of malnutrition,  

 Acknowledging the work done by the High-level Task Force on Global Food and 

Nutrition Security established by the Secretary-General, and supporting the 

Secretary-General in his continuing efforts in this regard, including continued 

engagement with Member States and the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights 

Council on the right to food, 

 1. Reaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human 

dignity and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at t he national, 

regional and international levels for its elimination;  

 2. Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe, sufficient and 

nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right 

of everyone to be free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his 

or her physical and mental capacities;  

 3. Considers it intolerable that, as estimated by the United Nations 

Children’s Fund, up to 45 per cent of the children who die every year before the age 

of 5 die from undernutrition and hunger-related illness, at least one in three children 

under the age of 5 is undernourished or overweight and one in two suffers from hidden 

hunger, undermining the capacity of millions of children to grow and develop to  their 

full potential, and that, as estimated by the World Food Programme, if the current 

trend continues, the number of hungry people worldwide will reach 840 million by 

2030, further compromising the achievement of the zero hunger target set out in the 

2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development;  

 4. Expresses its concern at the fact that the effects created by the world food 

crisis still continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable 

people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by 

the impacts of the world financial and economic crisis, and at the particular effects of 

the crisis on many net food-importing countries, especially the least developed 

countries; 

 5. Expresses particular concern at the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 

the fulfilment of all human rights for all, including the right to food, underlines that 

the pandemic is exacerbating existing high levels of acute food insecurity, and calls 

upon Member States and other relevant stakeholders to consider the fulfilment of the 

right to food as part of the response to and recovery from the pandemic  by, inter alia, 

keeping food and agriculture supply chains functioning, ensuring the continued trade 

in and movement of food and livestock, products and inputs essential for agricultural 

and food production to markets, minimizing food loss and waste, supporting workers 

and farmers, including women farmers, in agriculture and food supply chains to 

continue their essential work, including cross-border, in a safe manner, mobilizing 

and allocating adequate resources and enhancing institutional capacities for an 

accelerated implementation of sustainable agriculture and food systems, providing 

continued access to adequate, safe, affordable and nutritious food, and providing 

adequate social safety nets and assistance to minimize the negative effects of loss of 

livelihoods and increasing food prices on food insecurity and malnutrition;  

 6. Expresses its deep concern that, according to the report of the Food and 

Agriculture Organization of the United Nations entitled The State of Food Security 

and Nutrition in the World 2019: Safeguarding against Economic Slowdowns and 

Downturns, the number of hungry people in the world is growing, the vast majority 



 
A/C.3/75/L.26 

 

7/12 20-14337 

 

of hungry people live in developing countries and 2 billion people in the world 

experience moderate or severe food insecurity;  

 7. Also expresses its deep concern  that, while women contribute more than 

50 per cent of the food produced worldwide, they also account for 70 per cent of the 

world’s hungry, that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food 

insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that 

in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and 

preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many 

women as men suffer from malnutrition;  

 8. Encourages all States to mainstream a gender perspective in food security 

programmes and to take action to address de jure and de facto gender inequality and 

discrimination against women, in particular when they contribute to the malnutrition 

of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the 

right to food and that women have equal access to resources, including income, land 

and water and their ownership and agricultural inputs, as well as full and equal access 

to health care, education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves 

and their families, and in this regard stresses the need to empower women and 

strengthen their role in decision-making; 

 9. Encourages the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the 

right to food to continue to mainstream a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his 

mandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 

Nations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms addressing the right to 

food and food insecurity and malnutrition to continue to integrate a gender 

perspective into their relevant policies, programmes and activities;  

 10. Reaffirms the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and 

nutritious food are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities;  

 11. Stresses that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect 

the right to food and that the international community should provide, through a 

coordinated response and upon request, international cooperation in support of 

national and regional efforts by providing the assistance necessary to increase food 

production and access to food, including through agricultural development assistance, 

the transfer of technology, food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid, ensuring 

food security, with special attention to the specific needs of women and girls, and 

promoting innovation, support for the development of adapted technologies, research 

on rural advisory services and support for access to financing services, and ensure 

support for the establishment of secure land tenure systems;  

 12. Calls upon all States and, if appropriate, relevant international 

organizations to take measures and support programmes that are aimed at combating 

undernutrition in mothers, in particular during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and in 

children, and the irreversible effects of chronic undernutrition in early childhood, in 

particular from birth to the age of 2 years; 

 13. Also calls upon all States and, where appropriate, relevant international 

organizations to implement policies and programmes to reduce and eliminate 

preventable mortality and morbidity, as a result of malnutrition,  of children under 

5 years of age, and in this regard urges States to disseminate the technical guidance 

prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 

in collaboration with the World Health Organization, 14 and to apply it, as appropriate,

in the design, implementation, evaluation and monitoring of laws, policies, 

programmes, budgets and mechanisms for remedy and redress aimed at eliminating 

preventable mortality and morbidity of children under 5 years of age; 

 14. Encourages all States to take steps, with a view to progressively achieving 

the full realization of the right to food, including steps to promote the conditions for 

everyone to be free from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy fully the right to 

food, and to create and adopt national plans to combat hunger;  

 15. Recognizes the advances made through South-South cooperation in 

developing countries and regions in connection with food security and the 

development of agricultural production for the full realization  of the right to food; 

 16. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and responsible 

public investment in rural development, taking into consideration the Principles for 

Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems, as endorsed by the 

Committee on World Food Security, is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, 

in particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investment, 

including private investment, in appropriate small-scale irrigation and water 

management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts and to tackle 

water scarcity; 

 17. Recognizes the critical contribution made by the fisheries sector to the 

realization of the right to food and to food security and the contribution of small -scale 

fishers to the local food security of coastal communities; 

 18. Also recognizes that 70 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas, where 

nearly half a billion family farmers are located, and that these people are especially 

vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of  inputs and the fall in farm 

incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing 

challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural 

policies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and 

insurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security 

and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing 

communities and local enterprises, including through the facilit ation of access for 

their products to national and international markets and empowerment of small 

producers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and 

the provision of the right to food;  

 19. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through 

national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and 

land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically 

appropriate to the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation 

of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries 

Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; 15 

 20. Urges States that have not yet done so to favourably consider becoming 

parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity 16 and to consider becoming parties 

to the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture 17 as 

a matter of priority; 

 21. Recognizes the important role of indigenous peoples and their traditional 

knowledge and seed supply systems, as well as the important role of new

and improved nutrition; 

 22. Recalls the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 

Peoples,18 acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of 

indigenous peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concerns over the 

obstacles and challenges they face in achieving the full enjoyment of the right to food, 

and calls upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the
