strengthening international peace and security, in accordance with the purposes and
principles of the Charter of the United Nations,

Recalling the provisions on nuclear-weapon-free zones of the Final Document
of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly,2 the first special session
devoted to disarmament,

Stressing the importance of the treaties of Tlatelolco,3 Rarotonga,4 Bangkok5
and Pelindaba,6 establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones, as well as the Antarctic
Treaty,7 to, inter alia, achieve a world entirely free of nuclear weapons,

Underlining also the value of enhancing cooperation among the nuclear-
weapon-free zone treaty members by means of mechanisms such as joint meetings
of States parties, signatories and observers to those treaties,

Recalling the applicable principles and rules of international law relating to the
freedom of the high seas and the rights of passage through maritime space, including
those of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,8

1. Welcomes the continued contribution that the Antarctic Treaty,7 and the
treaties of Tlatelolco,3 Rarotonga,4 Bangkok5 and Pelindaba6 are making towards
freeing the southern hemisphere and adjacent areas covered by those treaties from
nuclear weapons;

2. Calls for the ratification of the treaties of Tlatelolco, Rarotonga, Bangkok
and Pelindaba by all States of the region, and calls upon all concerned States to
continue to work together in order to facilitate adherence to the protocols to nuclear-
weapon-free zone treaties by all relevant States that have not yet done so;

3. Welcomes the steps taken to conclude further nuclear-weapon-free zone
treaties on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region
concerned, and calls upon all States to consider all relevant proposals, including
those reflected in its resolutions on the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones
in the Middle East and South Asia;

4. Convinced of the important role of nuclear-weapon-free zones in
strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime and in extending the areas of the
world that are nuclear-weapon-free, and with particular reference to the
responsibilities of the nuclear-weapon States, calls upon all States to support the
process of nuclear disarmament and to work for the total elimination of all nuclear
weapons;

cooperation among themselves and their treaty agencies;

treaties to provide assistance to the States parties and signatories to such treaties so
