 Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political

 Underlining the importance of providing and maintaining stability and security 
throughout Somalia, and underscoring the importance of disarmament, 
demobilization and reintegration of militia and ex-combatants in Somalia, 

 Reaffirming its condemnation of all acts of, and incitement to, violence inside 
Somalia, expressing its concern at all acts intended to prevent or block a peaceful 
political process, and expressing its further concern at such acts and incitement 
continuing,  

 Recalling that cooperation between the United Nations and the regional 
arrangements in matters relating to the maintenance of peace and security, as are 
appropriate for regional action, is an integral part of collective security as provided 
for in the Charter of the United Nations,  

 Welcoming the communiqué of the African Union Peace and Security Council 
of 29 June 2008, which states that the African Union will extend from 17 July 2008 
the mandate of its mission to Somalia (AMISOM) for an additional six months,  

 Emphasizing the contribution that AMISOM is making to lasting peace and 
stability in Somalia, welcoming in particular the continuing commitment of the 
Governments of Uganda and Burundi, condemning any hostility towards AMISOM, 
and urging all parties in Somalia and the region to support and cooperate with 
AMISOM,  

 Welcoming the signature on 19 August 2008 of the agreement between the

 Recalling its willingness to consider, at an appropriate time, a peacekeeping 
operation to take over from AMISOM, subject to progress in the political process 
and improvement in the security situation on the ground, 

 Underlining that the full deployment of AMISOM will help facilitate the full 
withdrawal of other foreign forces from Somalia and help create the conditions for

deployment, to the extent possible and as appropriate, with the goal of achieving 
United Nations standards, and, in this regard, takes note of the proposals set out in
