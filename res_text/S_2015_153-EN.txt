 Deeply concerned that the conflict has resulted in great human suffering, 

including significant loss of life, displacement of two million people, and the loss of 

property, further impoverishing and disadvantaging the people of South Sudan,  

 Strongly condemning past and ongoing human rights violations and abuses and 

violations of international humanitarian law, including those involving targeted

other forms of sexual and gender-based violence, recruitment and use of children in 

armed conflict, abductions, enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and detention, 

violence aimed at spreading terror among the civilian population, and attacks on 

schools, places of worship and hospitals, as well as United Nations and associated 

peacekeeping personnel and objects, by all parties, including armed groups and

violations, further condemning harassment and targeting of civil society,
