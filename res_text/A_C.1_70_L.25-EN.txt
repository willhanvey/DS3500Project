 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 48/75 L of 16 December 1993, 53/77 I of 4 December 

1998, 55/33 Y of 20 November 2000, 56/24 J of 29 November 2001, 57/80 of 

22 November 2002, 58/57 of 8 December 2003, 59/81 of 3 December 2004, 64/29 

of 2 December 2009, 65/65 of 8 December 2010, 66/44 of 2 December 2011 and 

67/53 of 3 December 2012, as well as its decisions 68/518 and 69/516 on the subject 

of banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear 

explosive devices, 

 Reaffirming the importance of ensuring continued international commitment 

and high-level attention to making practical progress on achieving a world without 

nuclear weapons and on non-proliferation in all its aspects,  

 Mindful of the continuing importance and relevance of the Conference on 

Disarmament, and recalling the past achievements of that body in successfully 

negotiating non-proliferation and disarmament agreements,  

 Convinced that a non-discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and 

effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear 

weapons or other nuclear explosive devices would represent a practical contribution 

to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation efforts, 

 Noting with appreciation the submissions by 37 Member States and the 

European Union to the Secretary-General of views on a treaty banning the 

production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive 



A/C.1/70/L.25 
 

 

15-18213 2/2 

 

devices, including possible aspects thereof, and the subsequent report submitted to 

the General Assembly by the Secretary-General at its sixty-eighth session,
1
 

 Welcoming the work accomplished in 2014 and 2015 by the Group of 25 

Governmental Experts convened by the Secretary-General, on the basis of equitable 

geographical distribution, to make recommendations on possible aspects that could 

contribute to but not negotiate a treaty banning the production of fissile material for 

nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices,  

 1. Urges the Conference on Disarmament to agree on and implement a 

balanced and comprehensive programme of work that includes the immediate 

commencement of negotiations on a treaty banning the production of fissile material 

for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of document 

CD/1299 and the mandate contained therein; 

 2. Welcomes the adoption by consensus of the report of the Group of 

Governmental Experts, mandated in resolution 67/53, as contained in document  

A/70/81; 

 3. Calls upon the Secretary-General, building on the report contained in 

document A/68/154 and Add.1, to seek the views of Member States on the report of 

the Group of Governmental Experts and to submit a report on the subject to the 

General Assembly at its seventy-first session; 

 4. Urges Member States to give due consideration to the report of the 

Group of Governmental Experts, calls upon the Conference on Disarmament to fully 

examine the report and consider further action as appropriate, and encourages 

Conference members to include in their delegations technical experts as may be 

required to facilitate deliberations on issues identified in the report;  

 5. Calls upon future negotiators of a treaty to take into account the work of 

the Group of Governmental Experts as appropriate in their deliberations; 

 6. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-first session, 

under the item entitled “General and complete disarmament”, the sub-item entitled 

“Treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other 

nuclear explosive devices”.
