DRAFT RESOLUTION I

Medium-term planning in the United Nations 25/

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolutions 32/197 of 20 December 1977 on the restructuring of
the economic and social sectors of the United Nations system and 33/118 of
19 December 1978, especially paragraph 4 thereof in which it welcomed the intention-
of the Committee for Programme and Co-ordination to conduct an in-depth study of
the programme planning process during its nineteenth session,

Having considered the report of the Committee for Programme and Co-ordination
on the work of its nineteenth session, 26/ the reports of the Secretary-General 27/
and of the Joint Inspection Unit 28/ onlnedium-term planning in the United Nations,
and the comments of the Secretary-General thereon, 29/

Considering that medium-term planning should, among other things, strengthen
the relationship between planning and development and contribute to a better and
more rational management of United Nations activities, to better interagency
co-ordination and to the attainment of the objectives of the new international
economic order and of the international development strategies,

1. Takes note with sRtisfaction of the aforementioned reports;

2. Endorses the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of
the Committee for Programme and Co-ordination on the work of its nineteenth
session 30/ and decides to establish the following principles and guidelines for
medium-term planning in the United Nations:

25/ At the Illth plenary meeting, on 20 December 1979, before the adoption of
the draft resolution, the Rapporteur of the Fifth Committee indicated that the
draft resolution came within the framework of item 101 (Joint Inspection Unit).

(a) The planning process, which is a part of the over-all management process,
should be forward-looking and dynamic; the plan should be deductive, with its
strategy, orientation, goals and activities deriving from the objectives and policy
orientations set by the intergovernmental organs;

(b) The medium-term plan should be a faithful translation of legislative
mandates into programmes;

(c)
Assembly,

(d)

The plan will remain a proposal until its adoption by the General
upon which, it will become the principal policy directive; 31/

The medium-term plan should be comprehensive and not staggered;

(e) The flexibility of the plan should be achieved through reviews by
intergovernmental organs as detailed as required to incorporate the programme
implications of the resolutions and decisions adopted by those organs or
international conferences since the adoption of the plan;

(f) The effective participation of central and regional, sectoral and
functional bodies in the formulation, consideration, review and evaluation of the
plan should be achieved by means of an appropriate preparation period and greater
co-ordination of their calendars of meetings;

(g) The introduction to the plan, which constitutes a key integral element
in the planning process, should highlight the policy orientations of the United
Nations system and indicate the medium-term objectives and strategy and the trends
deduced from the mandates which reflect the priorities set by the intergovernmental
organs;

(h) The plan should emphasize the description of objectives and strategy;
the presentation and format of the analyses provided therein should vary according
to the type and nature of activities;

(i) The plan should serve as the framework for the formulation of the
biennial programme budget;

(j) The density of the information provided in the plan should vary in
relation to the time-horizon of the planning and the needs of the reviewing bodies;

(k) The planning process should take into account the needs of interagency
co-ordination; this co-ordination does not necessarily require system-wide
synchronization of planning periods;

(1) Performance reporting and evaluation are key elements in the planning and
programming cycle; the relevant mechanisms should be strengthened and the relevant
techniques refined; the use of achievement indicators should be developed;

31/ Reaffirmation of the principle already established in General Assembly
resolution 31/93, para. 3 (c).

(m) The medium-term plan should cover a period of six years;

(n) The next medium-term plan should cover the period 1984-1989; accordingly,
the submission of a proposed plan for the period 1982-1985, scheduled for 1980,
is no longer required;

(0) The current plan should be reviewed at an appropriate time to take
account of all decisions with programme implications during the biennium 1980-1981;

(p) The medium-term plan should cla-arly identify new activities; the planning
process should also make it possible to identify completed activities or activities
of marginal utility;

('1.) Emphasis should be placed on objectives and strategy; objectives should
be time-limited as far as possible and the plan should be objective-based in all
programmes where it is feasible;

(r) Financial indications should be shown in the plan along the lines
recommended by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions in
its report on the medium-term plan for the period 1980-1983; 32/

3. Approves the request made by the COIT@ittee for Prograwme and
Co-ordination 33/ to the Secretary-General to submit to the Committee at its
twentieth session a draft calendar of preparation for the proposed medium-term
plan for the period 1984-1989 and, on the basis of general principles and
specific recommendations formulated by the Committee at its nineteenth session,
model programmes that would help to clarify the questions of the programme
structure of the medium-term plan, the nature of the objectives of the plan and
the possibility of defining time-limited objectiVeS;

4. Requests the Committee for Programme and Co-ordination to reconsider at
its twentieth session the question of whether the plan should be a "fixed" or a
"rolling" plan, so as to enable the General Assembly to take a decision on that
matter at its thirty-fifth session.
