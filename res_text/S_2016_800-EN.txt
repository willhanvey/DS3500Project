 The Security Council,  

 Recalling its resolution 1887 (2009), and reaffirming its firm commitment to 

the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in all its aspects,  

 Reaffirming the Statement of its President adopted at the Council’s meeting at 

the level of Heads of State and Government on 31 January 1992 (S/23500), 

including the need for all Member States to fulfil their obligations in relation to 

arms control and disarmament and to prevent proliferation in all its aspects of all 

weapons of mass destruction, 

 Underlining that the NPT remains the cornerstone of the nuclear 

non-proliferation regime and the essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear 

disarmament and for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy,  

 Reaffirming that proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and their means 

of delivery, constitutes a threat to international peace and security,  

 Recalling that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (Treaty), adopted 

by the General Assembly by its resolution 50/245 of 10 September 1996, was 

opened for signature on 24 September 1996, and that States Signatories, by their 

resolution on 19 November 1996, including paragraph 7 thereof, established the 

Preparatory Commission (PrepCom) for the Comprehensive Nuclear -Test-Ban Treaty 

Organization, 

 Recognizing that a universal and internationally and effectively verifiable test 

ban treaty that has entered into force is the most effective way to ban nuclear-

weapon test explosions and any other nuclear explosions, and that an end to all such

nuclear-weapon test explosions and any other nuclear explosions will constrain the 

development and qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons and end the 

development of advanced new types of nuclear weapons,  

 Recognizing that early entry into force of the Treaty will constitute an effective 

nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation measure that would contribute to the 

achievement of a world without nuclear weapons, 

 Welcoming progress made towards universalization of the Treaty, noting that 

183 States have signed the Treaty and 166 States have deposited their instruments of 

ratification, and further noting that of the 44 States listed in Annex 2 to the Treaty, 

whose ratification is needed for its entry into force, 41 have signed and 36 have 

both signed and ratified the Treaty, including several nuclear weapons States,  

 Welcoming the efforts of Member States of the PrepCom and its Provisional 

Technical Secretariat to build all elements of the Treaty’s verification regime, 

unprecedented in its global reach, recognizing the maturity of and progress achieved 

in the establishment of the International Monitoring System (IMS), as well as the 

satisfactory functioning of the International Data Centre (IDC) that has 

demonstrated its ability to provide independent and reliable means to ensure 

compliance with the Treaty once it enters into force, and emphasizing the continuing 

progress in developing, exercising, and demonstrating the advanced technologies 

and logistical capabilities necessary to execute on-site inspections, 

 Stressing the vital importance and urgency of achieving the early entry into 

force of the Treaty, 

 1. Urges all States that have either not signed or not ratified the Treaty, 

particularly the eight remaining Annex 2 States, to do so without further delay;  

 2. Encourages all State Signatories, including Annex 2 States, to promote 

the universality and early entry into force of the Treaty; 

 3. Recalls the statements by each of the five nuclear-weapon States, noted 

by resolution 984 (1995), in which they give security assurances against the use of 

nuclear weapons to non-nuclear-weapon State Parties to the NPT, and affirms that 

such security assurances strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime; 

 4. Calls upon all States to refrain from conducting any nuclear-weapon test 

explosion or any other nuclear explosion and to maintain their moratoria in this 

regard, commends those States’ national moratoria, some of which are established 

by national legislation pending entry into force of the Treaty, emphasizes that such 

moratoria are an example of responsible international behaviour that contr ibutes to 

international peace and stability and should continue, while stressing that such 

moratoria do not have the same permanent and legally binding effect as entry into 

force of the Treaty, and notes the Joint Statement on the Comprehensive Nuclear 

Test-Ban Treaty by China, France, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and 

the United States of America of September 15, 2016, in which those States noted 

that, inter alia, “a nuclear-weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion 

would defeat the object and purpose of the CTBT”; 

 5. Underlines the need to maintain momentum towards completion of all 

elements of the Treaty verification regime, and in this regard, calls upon all States

to provide the support required to enable the PrepCom to complete all its tasks in 

the most efficient and cost effective way, and encourages all States hosting 

International Monitoring System facilities to transmit data to the IDC on a testing 

and provisional basis, pending entry into force of the Treaty;  

 6. Welcomes the voluntary information in the national statements in the 

PrepCom by States listed in Annex 1 to the Protocol to the Treaty as responsible for 

one or more facilities of the IMS on the status of completing the construction of 

those facilities as well as regarding the status of transmission of data from their 

facilities to the IDC, encourages States hosting IMS facilities to complete 

construction of the IMS facilities in a timely manner as provided for by the Treaty 

and text on the establishment of the PrepCom, and invites the Provisional Technical 

Secretariat to provide a report to all State Signatories within 180 days of the 

adoption of this resolution on the status of States Signatories assessed contributions 

to the PrepCom and any additional support provided by State Signatories for the 

completion of the Treaty’s verification regime and for the maintenance and 

operational needs for the IDC and IMS;  

 7. Recognizes that even absent entry into force of the Treaty the monitoring 

and analytical elements of the verification regime, operating on a testing and 

provisional basis, are at the disposal of the international community in conformity 

with the Treaty and under the guidance of the Preparatory Commission, and that 

such elements contribute to regional stability as a significant confidence -building 

measure, and strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime;  

 8. Affirms that entry into force of the Treaty will contribute to the 

enhancement of international peace and security through its effective prevention of 

the proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects and through its contribution to 

nuclear disarmament and recognizes that the Provisional Technical Secretariat has 

demonstrated its utility in bringing tangible scientific and civil benefits to States, 

for example through early tsunami warnings and seismological monitoring, and in 

this regard encourages the PrepCom to consider ways to ensure that these benefits 

can be broadly shared by the international community in conformity with the Treaty, 

through capacity building and the sharing of relevant expertise on the verification 

regime; 

 9. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
