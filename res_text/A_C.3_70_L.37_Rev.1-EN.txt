 Reiterating its continuing support for the New Partnership for Africa’s 

Development
10

 as a development framework for Africa,  

 Expressing its appreciation for the efforts of the Chair-Rapporteur of the 

Working Group on the Right to Development of the Human Rights Council and the 

members of the high-level task force on the implementation of the right to 

development in completing the 2008-2010 three-phase road map established by the 

Council in its resolution 4/4 of 30 March 2007,
11

  

 Deeply concerned about the negative impacts of the global economic and 

financial crises on the realization of the right to development,  

 Recognizing that, while development facilitates the enjoyment of all human 

rights, the lack of development may not be invoked to justify the abridgement of 

internationally recognized human rights,  

 Recognizing also that Member States should cooperate with one another in 

ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development, that the international 

community should promote effective international cooperation for the realization of 

the right to development and the elimination of obstacles to development and that 

lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires 

effective development policies at the national level, as well as equitable economic 

relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level,  

 Recognizing further that poverty is an affront to human dignity,  

 Recognizing that extreme poverty and hunger are among the greatest global 

threats and require the collective commitment of the international community for their 

eradication, pursuant to Millennium Development Goal 1 and Sustainable 

Development Goals 1 and 2, and therefore calling upon the international community, 

including the Human Rights Council, to contribute towards achieving that goal,  

 Recognizing also that historical injustices, inter alia, have contributed to the 

poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion, economic disparity, 

instability and insecurity that affect many people in different parts of the world, in 

particular in developing countries,  

 Recognizing further that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, 

including extreme poverty, is one of the critical elements in the promotion and 

realization of the right to development and is the greatest global challenge and an 

indispensable requirement for sustainable development, which requires a multifaceted 

and integrated approach, and committed to achieving sustainable development in its 

three dimensions — economic, social and environmental — in a balanced and 

integrated manner, 

 Emphasizing that all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the 

right to development, are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated,  

 Emphasizing also that the right to development should be central to the 

implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,

 Welcoming the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 

reaffirming that the Declaration on the Right to Development informed the 2030 

Agenda, along with other relevant international instruments, and underlining the fact that 

the Sustainable Development Goals can be realized only through a credible, effective 

and universal commitment to the means of implementation by all stakeholders,  

 Stressing that the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to 

Development presents a unique opportunity for the international community to 

demonstrate and reiterate its unequivocal commitment to the right to development, 

recognizing the high profile that it deserves, and redoubling its efforts to implement 

this right,

United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights
13

 concerning the promotion 

and realization of the right to development;  

 2. Recognizes the significance of all the events held to commemorate the 

twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to Development,

an integral part of all human rights and fundamental freedoms;  

 4. Supports the realization of the mandate of the Working Group on the Right 

to Development, as renewed by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 9/3 of

Working Group with a view to completing the tasks entrusted to it by the Council in 

its resolution 4/4;
11

 

 6. Emphasizes the relevant provisions of General Assembly resolution 

60/251 of 15 March 2006 establishing the Human Rights Council, and in this regard 

calls upon the Council to implement the agreement to continue to act to ensure that 

its agenda promotes and advances sustainable development and the achievement of 

the Millennium Development Goals, and also in this regard to lead the raising of the 

right to development, as set out in paragraphs 5 and 10 of the Vienna Declaration

 to the same level as and on a par with all other human 

rights and fundamental freedoms; 

 7. Stresses that the views, criteria and corresponding operational 

subcriteria, once considered, revised and endorsed by the Working Group, should be 

used, as appropriate, in the elaboration of a comprehensive and coherent set of 

standards for the implementation of the right to development;   

 8. Emphasizes the importance of the Working Group taking appropriate 

steps to ensure respect for and practical application of the above -mentioned 

standards, which could take various forms, including the elaboration of guidelines 

on the implementation of the right to development, and evolve into a basis for the 

consideration of an international legal standard of a binding nature through a 

collaborative process of engagement; 

 9. Recalls the request made to the Working Group to consider at its 

seventeenth session a document, to be produced by its Chair -Rapporteur, containing 

a set of standards to implement the right to development based on relevant United 

Nations resolutions and documents, including the Declaration on the Right to 

Development, relevant international conventions and decisions as well as 

internationally agreed development goals and United Nations resolutions, in 

consultation with Member States, relevant international organizations and other 

stakeholders; 

 10. Also recalls that the above-mentioned document would be prepared 

without prejudice to the ongoing discussions on the criteria and operational 

subcriteria, in the context of which the Working Group shall complete its seco nd 

reading at its seventeenth session and decide on further action thereafter, with the 

objective of elaborating a comprehensive and coherent set of standards for the 

implementation of the right to development;

after the seventeenth session, to consider further and discuss the document 

containing the draft set of standards;

conclusions of the Working Group at its third session,
17

 congruent with the purpose 

of international human rights instruments, such as equality, non -discrimination, 

accountability, participation and international cooperation, as critical to 

mainstreaming the right to development at the national and international levels, and 

underlines the importance of the principles of equity and transparency;  

 13. Also stresses that it is important that the Chair-Rapporteur and the 

Working Group, in the discharge of their mandates, take into account the need:  

 (a) To promote the democratization of the system of international 

governance in order to increase the effective participation of developing countries in 

international decision-making; 

 (b) To also promote effective partnerships such as the New Partnership for 

Africa’s Development
10

 and other similar initiatives with the developing countries, 

particularly the least developed countries, for the purpose of the realization of their 

right to development, including the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals;

 (c) To strive for greater acceptance, operationalization and realization of the 

right to development at the international level, while urging all States to undertake at 

the national level the necessary policy formulation and to institute the measures 

required for the implementation of the right to development as an integral part of all 

human rights and fundamental freedoms, and also while urging all States to expand 

and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation in ensuring development and eliminating 

obstacles to development in the context of promoting effective international 

cooperation for the realization of the right to development, bearing in mind that lasting 

progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective 

development policies at the national level and a favourable economic environment at 

the international level; 

 (d) To consider ways and means to continue to ensure the operationalization 

of the right to development as a priority;  

 (e) To mainstream the right to development in the policies and operational 

activities of the United Nations and the specialized agencies, funds and programmes, 

as well as in the policies and strategies of the international financial and multilateral 

trading systems, bearing in mind in this regard that the core principles of the 

international economic, commercial and financial spheres, such as equity,  

non-discrimination, transparency, accountability, participation and international 

cooperation, including effective partnerships for development, are indispensable in 

achieving the right to development and preventing discriminatory treatment arising 

from political or other non-economic considerations in addressing the issues of 

concern to the developing countries; 

 14. Encourages the Human Rights Council to continue to consider how to 

ensure follow-up to the work of the former Subcommission on the Promotion and 

Protection of Human Rights on the right to development, in accordance with the 

relevant provisions of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the 

Commission on Human Rights and in compliance with decisions to be taken by  

the Council; 

 15. Reaffirms the commitment to implement the goals and targets set out in all 

the outcome documents of the major United Nations conferences and summits and 

their review processes, in particular those relating to the realization of the right to 

development, recognizing that the realization of the right to development is critical to 

achieving the objectives, goals and targets set in those outcome documents;  

 16. Also reaffirms that the realization of the right to development is essential 

to the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which 

regards all human rights as universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, 

places the human person at the centre of development and recognizes that, while 

development facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights, lack of development may 

not be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally recognized human rights;  

 17. Stresses that the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection 

of all human rights lies with the State, and reaffirms that States have the primary 

responsibility for their own economic and social development and that the role of 

national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized;  

 18. Reaffirms the primary responsibility of States to create national and 

international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to development, as 

well as their commitment to cooperate with one another to that end;

7/10 15-20301 

 

 19. Expresses concern about the increasing cases of human rights violations 

and abuses by some transnational corporations and other business enterprises,  

underlines the need to ensure that appropriate protection, justice and remedies are 

provided to the victims of human rights violations and abuses resulting from their 

activities, and underscores the fact that these entities must contribute to the means 

of implementation for the realization of the right to development;  

 20. Reaffirms the need for an international environment that is conducive to  

the realization of the right to development;  

 21. Stresses the need to strive for greater acceptance, operationalization and 

realization of the right to development at the international and national levels, and calls 

upon all States to institute the measures required for the implementation of the right to 

development as an integral part of all human rights and fundamental freedoms;  

 22. Emphasizes the critical importance of identifying and analysing obstacles 

impeding the full realization of the right to development at both the national and 

international levels; 

 23. Affirms that, while globalization offers both opportunities and challenges, 

the process of globalization remains deficient in achieving the objectives of integrating 

all countries into a globalized world, stresses the need for policies and measures at the 

national and global levels to respond to the challenges and opportunities of 

globalization if this process is to be made fully inclusive and equitable, recognizes that 

globalization has brought disparities between and within countries and that issues such 

as trade and trade liberalization, transfer of technology, infrastructure development and 

market access should be managed effectively in order to mitigate the challenges of 

poverty and underdevelopment and the need to make the right to development a reality 

for everyone; 

 24. Recognizes that, despite continuous efforts on the part of the 

international community, the gap between developed and developing countries 

remains unacceptably wide, that most of the developing countries continue to face 

difficulties in participating in the globalization process and that many risk being 

marginalized and effectively excluded from its benefits;  

 25. Expresses its deep concern, in this regard, about the negative impact on 

the realization of the right to development due to the further aggravation of the 

economic and social situation, in particular of developing countries, as a result of 

the ongoing international energy, food and financial crises, as well as the i ncreasing 

challenges posed by global climate change and the loss of biodiversity, which have 

increased vulnerabilities and inequalities and have adversely affected development 

gains, in particular in developing countries;  

 26. Recalls the commitment in the United Nations Millennium Declaration
4
 of 

halving the number of people living in poverty by 2015, notes with concern that some 

developing countries have failed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, and 

in this regard invites Member States and the international community to take 

proactive measures aimed at creating a conducive environment to contribute to the 

effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in particular 

increasing international cooperation, including partnership and commitment, between 

developed and developing countries towards achieving the Goals;  



A/C.3/70/L.37/Rev.1 
 

 

15-20301 8/10 

 

 27. Urges developed countries that have not yet done so to make concrete 

efforts towards meeting the targets of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for 

official development assistance to developing countries and 0.15 to 0.2 per cent of 

their gross national product to least developed countries, and encourages developing 

countries to build on the progress achieved in ensuring that offic ial development 

assistance is used effectively to help to meet development goals and targets;  

 28. Recognizes the need to address market access for developing countries, 

including in the sectors of agriculture, services and non -agricultural products, in 

particular those of interest to developing countries;  

 29. Calls once again for the implementation of a desirable pace of 

meaningful trade liberalization, including in areas under negotiation in the World 

Trade Organization, the implementation of commitments on implementation-related 

issues and concerns, a review of special and differential treatment provisions, with a 

view to strengthening them and making them more precise, effective and 

operational, the avoidance of new forms of protectionism and capacity -building and 

technical assistance for developing countries as important issues in making progress 

towards the effective implementation of the right to development;  

 30. Recognizes the important link between the international economic, 

commercial and financial spheres and the realization of the right to development, 

stresses in this regard the need for good governance and for broadening the base of 

decision-making at the international level on issues of development concern and the 

need to fill organizational gaps, as well as to strengthen the United Nations system 

and other multilateral institutions, and also stresses the need to broaden and 

strengthen the participation of developing countries and countries with economies in 

transition in international economic decision-making and norm-setting; 

 31. Also recognizes that good governance and the rule of law at the national 

level assist all States in the promotion and protection of human rights, including the 

right to development, and agrees on the value of the ongoing efforts being made by 

States to identify and strengthen good governance practices, including transparent, 

responsible, accountable and participatory government, that are responsive and 

appropriate to their needs and aspirations, including in the context of agreed 

partnership approaches to development, capacity-building and technical assistance; 

 32. Further recognizes the important role and the rights of women and the 

application of a gender perspective as a cross-cutting issue in the process of 

realizing the right to development, and notes in particular the positive relationship 

between the education of women and their equal participation in the civil, cultural, 

economic, political and social activities of the community and the promotion of the 

right to development; 

 33. Stresses the need for the integration of the rights of children, girls and 

boys alike, in all policies and programmes and for ensuring the promotion and 

protection of those rights, especially in areas relating to health, education and the 

full development of their capacities;  

 34. Recalls the Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Intensifying Our 

Efforts to Eliminate HIV and AIDS,
18

 adopted on 10 June 2011 at the high-level

international human rights obligations and taking into account, as appropriate, the 

United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted by the 

General Assembly in its resolution 61/295 of 13 September 2007, and in this regard 

recalls the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly known as the World 

Conference on Indigenous Peoples, held in 2014;
