efforts in the field of human rights, and hoping that the enhanced dialogue will 
contribute to improving the situation of children in the country,  

 Taking note of the concluding observations of the treaty-monitoring bodies 
under the four treaties to which the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is a 
party, the most recent of which were given by the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child in January 2009,4 

 Noting with appreciation the collaboration established between the 
Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United Nations 
Children’s Fund and the World Health Organization in order to improve the health 
situation in the country, and the collaboration established with the United Nations 
Children’s Fund in order to improve the quality of education for children, 

 Noting the decision on the resumption, on a modest scale, of the activities of 
the United Nations Development Programme in the Democratic People’s Republic 
of Korea, and encouraging the engagement of the Government with the international 
community to ensure that the programmes benefit the persons in need of assistance, 

 Recalling its resolutions 60/173 of 16 December 2005, 61/174 of 19 December

2006 and Human Rights Council resolutions 7/15 of 27 March 2008 and 10/16 of 
26 March 2009, and mindful of the need for the international community to 
strengthen its coordinated efforts aimed at achieving the implementation of those 
resolutions, 

 Taking note of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,5 regretting that he still has not 
been allowed to visit the country and that he received no cooperation from the 
authorities of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and taking note also of 
the comprehensive report of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea submitted in accordance with 
resolution 63/190, 

 Noting the importance of the inter-Korean dialogue, which could contribute to 
the improvement of the human rights and humanitarian situation in the country, 

 Welcoming the recent resumption of the reunion of separated families across 
the border, which is an urgent humanitarian concern of the entire Korean people, 

 1. Expresses its very serious concern at: 

 (a) The persistence of continuing reports of systematic, widespread and 
grave violations of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights in the 
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, including: 

 (i) Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
including inhuman conditions of detention, public executions, extrajudicial 
and arbitrary detention; the absence of due process and the rule of law, 
including fair trial guarantees and an independent judiciary; the imposition of

the death penalty for political and religious reasons; collective punishments; 
and the existence of a large number of prison camps and the extensive use of 
forced labour; 

 (ii) Limitations imposed on every person who wishes to move freely within 
the country and travel abroad, including the punishment of those who leave or 
try to leave the country without permission, or their families, as well as 
punishment of persons who are returned; 

 (iii) The situation of refugees and asylum-seekers expelled or returned to the 
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and sanctions imposed on citizens of 
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea who have been repatriated from 
abroad, leading to punishments of internment, torture, cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or the death penalty, and, in this regard, urges all States to 
respect the fundamental principle of non-refoulement, to treat those who seek 
refuge humanely and to ensure unhindered access to the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees and his Office, with a view to improving the 
situation of those who seek refuge, and once again urges States parties to 
comply with their obligations under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status 
of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol thereto in relation to refugees from the 
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea who are covered by those instruments; 

 (iv) All-pervasive and severe restrictions on the freedoms of thought, 
conscience, religion, opinion and expression, peaceful assembly and 
association, the right to privacy and equal access to information, by such 
means as the persecution of individuals exercising their freedom of opinion 
and expression, and their families, and on the right of everyone to take part in 
the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives, 
of his or her country;  

 (v) The violations of economic, social and cultural rights, which have led to 
severe malnutrition, widespread health problems and other hardship for the 
population in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, in particular for 
persons belonging to particularly exposed groups, inter alia, women, children 
and the elderly; 

 (vi) Continuing violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
women, in particular the trafficking of women for the purpose of prostitution 
or forced marriage and the subjection of women to human smuggling, forced 
abortions, gender-based discrimination, including in the economic sphere, and 
gender-based violence; 

 (vii) Continuing reports of violations of the human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of children, in particular the continued lack of access to basic 
economic, social and cultural rights for many children, and in this regard notes 
the particularly vulnerable situation faced by, inter alia, returned or repatriated 
children, street children, children with disabilities, children whose parents are 
detained, children living in detention, institutions and children in conflict with 
the law;4 

 (viii) Continuing reports of violations of the human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of persons with disabilities, especially on the use of collective camps 
and of coercive measures that target the rights of persons with disabilities to 
decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children;  



A/C.3/64/L.35  
 

09-58726 4 
 

 (ix) Violations of workers’ rights, including the right to freedom of 
association and collective bargaining, the right to strike as defined by the 
obligations of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea under the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,1 and the 
prohibition of the economic exploitation of children and of any harmful or 
hazardous work of children as defined by the obligations of the Democratic 
People’s Republic of Korea under the Convention on the Rights of the Child;2 

 (b) The continued refusal of the Government of the Democratic People’s 
Republic of Korea to recognize the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea or to extend 
cooperation to him, despite the renewal of the mandate by the Human Rights 
Council in its resolutions 7/15 and 10/16; 

 2. Reiterates its very serious concern at unresolved questions of 
international concern relating to abductions in the form of enforced disappearance, 
which violates the human rights of nationals of other sovereign countries, and in this 
regard strongly calls upon the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of 
Korea urgently to resolve these questions, including through existing channels, in a 
transparent manner, including by ensuring the immediate return of abductees; 

 3. Expresses its very deep concern at the precarious humanitarian situation 
in the country, partly as a result of frequent natural disasters, compounded by the 
misallocation of resources away from the satisfaction of basic needs, and the 
increasing State restrictions on the cultivation and trade in foodstuffs, as well as the 
prevalence of maternal malnutrition and of infant malnutrition, which, despite some 
progress, continues to affect the physical and mental development of a significant 
proportion of children, and urges the Government of the Democratic People’s 
Republic of Korea, in this regard, to take preventive and remedial action;  

 4. Commends the Special Rapporteur for the activities undertaken so far and 
for his continued efforts in the conduct of his mandate despite the limited access to 
information; 

 5. Strongly urges the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of 
Korea to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, in this 
regard: 

 (a) To immediately put an end to the systematic, widespread and grave 
violations of human rights mentioned above, inter alia, by implementing fully the 
measures set out in the above-mentioned resolutions of the General Assembly, the 
Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council, and the 
recommendations addressed to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea by the 
United Nations special procedures and treaty bodies; 

 (b) To protect its inhabitants, address the issue of impunity and ensure that 
those responsible for violations of human rights are brought to justice before an 
independent judiciary; 

 (c) To tackle the root causes leading to refugee outflows and prosecute those 
who exploit refugees by human smuggling, trafficking and extortion, while not 
criminalizing the victims, and to ensure that citizens of the Democratic People’s 
Republic of Korea expelled or returned to the Democratic People’s Republic of 



 A/C.3/64/L.35

Korea are able to return in safety and dignity, are humanely treated and are not 
subjected to any kind of punishment; 

 (d) To extend its full cooperation to the Special Rapporteur, including by 
granting him full, free and unimpeded access to the Democratic People’s Republic 
of Korea, and to other United Nations human rights mechanisms;  

 (e) To engage in technical cooperation activities in the field of human rights 
with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and her Office, as 
pursued by the High Commissioner in recent years, with a view to improving the 
situation of human rights in the country, and in the universal periodic review by the 
Human Rights Council; 

 (f) To engage in cooperation with the International Labour Organization 
with a view to significantly improving workers’ rights; 

 (g) To continue and reinforce its cooperation with United Nations 
humanitarian agencies; 

 (h) To ensure full, safe and unhindered access to humanitarian aid and take 
measures to allow humanitarian agencies to secure its impartial delivery to all parts 
of the country on the basis of need in accordance with humanitarian principles, as it 
pledged to do, and to ensure access to adequate food and implement food security 
policies, including through sustainable agriculture; 

 6. Decides to continue its examination of the situation of human rights in 
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea at its sixty-fifth session, and to this end 
requests the Secretary-General to submit a comprehensive report on the situation in 
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the Special Rapporteur to continue 
to report his findings and recommendations.
