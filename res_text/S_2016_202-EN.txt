 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous relevant resolutions, including resolution 825 (1993), 

resolution 1540 (2004), resolution 1695 (2006), resolution 1718 (2006), resolution 

1874 (2009), resolution 1887 (2009), resolution 2087 (2013) and resolution 2094 

(2013), as well as the statements of its President of 6 October 2006 

(S/PRST/2006/41), 13 April 2009 (S/PRST/2009/7) and 16 April 2012 

(S/PRST/2012/13),  

 Reaffirming that proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as 

well as their means of delivery, constitutes a threat to international peace and 

security,  

 Expressing gravest concern at the nuclear test conducted by the Democratic 

People’s Republic of Korea (“the DPRK”) on 6 January 2016 in violation of 

resolutions 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009), 2087 (2013) and 2094 (2013), and at the 

challenge such a test constitutes to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 

Weapons (“the NPT”) and to international efforts aimed at strengthening the global 

regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and the danger it poses to peace 

and stability in the region and beyond,  

 Underlining once again the importance that the DPRK respond to other 

security and humanitarian concerns of the international community,  

 Underlining also that measures imposed by this resolution are not intended to 

have adverse humanitarian consequences for the civilian population DPRK,  

 Regretting the DPRK’s diversion of financial, technical and industrial 

resources toward developing its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile program, and 

condemning its declared intent to develop nuclear weapons,

16-03393 2/19 

 

 Expressing deep concern at the grave hardship that the DPRK people are 

subjected to,  

 Expressing great concern that the DPRK’s arms sales have generated revenues 

that are diverted to the pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles while 

DPRK citizens have great unmet needs,  

 Expressing serious concern that the DPRK has continued to violate relevant 

Security Council resolutions through repeated launches of ballistic missiles in 2014 

and 2015, as well as the submarine-launched ballistic missile ejection test in 2015 

and noting that all such ballistic missile activities contribute to the DPRK’s 

development of nuclear weapons delivery systems and increase tension in the region 

and beyond, 

 Expressing continued concern that the DPRK is abusing the privileges and 

immunities accorded under the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular 

Relations, 

 Expressing its gravest concern that the DPRK’s ongoing nuclear-, and ballistic 

missile-related activities have further generated increased tension in the region and 

beyond, and determining that there continues to exist a clear threat to international 

peace and security,  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, and taking

on 6 January 2016 in violation and flagrant disregard of the Council’s relevant 

resolutions, and further condemns the DPRK’s launch of 7 February 2016, which

and in this context re-establish its pre-existing commitments to a moratorium on 

missile launches, and demands that the DPRK immediately comply fully with these 

obligations;

training, advice, services or assistance related to the provision, manufacture, 

maintenance or use of nuclear-related, ballistic missile-related or other weapons of 

mass destruction-related items, materials, equipment, goods and technology, and

DPRK’s operational capabilities of its armed forces, or to exports that support or 

enhance the operational capabilities of armed forces of another Member State 

outside the DPRK, and decides also that this provision shall cease to apply to the 

supply, sale or transfer of an item, or its procurement, if:  

 (a) the State determines that such activity is exclusively for humanitarian 

purposes or exclusively for livelihood purposes which will not be used by DPRK 

individuals or entities to generate revenue, and also not related to any activity 

prohibited by resolutions 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009), 2087 (2013), 2094 (2013) or 

this resolution, provided that the State notifies the Committee in advance of such 

determination and also informs the Committee of measures taken to prevent the 

diversion of the item for such other purposes, or  

 (b) the Committee has determined on a case-by-case basis that a particular

prohibit the procurement from the DPRK of technical training, advice, services or 

assistance related to the provision, manufacture, maintenance or use of arms and 

related materiel, and clarifies that this paragraph prohibits States from engaging in

paramilitary- or police-related training;  

 10. Decides that the measures specified in paragraph 8 (d) of resolution 1718

S/2016/202 
 

 

16-03393 4/19 

 

 12. Affirms that “economic resources,” as referred to in paragraph 8 (d) of 

resolution 1718 (2006), includes assets of every kind, whether tangible or 

intangible, movable or immovable, actual or potential, which potentially may be 

used to obtain funds, goods, or services, such as vessels (including maritime 

vessels);  

 13. Decides that if a Member State determines that a DPRK diplomat, 

governmental representative, or other DPRK national acting in a governmental 

capacity, is working on behalf or at the direction of a designated individual or entity, 

or of an individual or entities assisting in the evasion of sanctions or violating the 

provisions of resolutions 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009), 2087 (2013), 2094 (2013) or 

this resolution, then the Member State shall expel the individual from its territory 

for the purpose of repatriation to the DPRK consistent with applicable national and 

international law, provided that nothing in this paragraph shall impede the transit of 

representatives of the Government of the DPRK to the United Nations Headquarters 

or other UN facilities to conduct United Nations business, and decides that the 

provisions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to a particular individual if: 

a) the presence of the individual is required for fulfilment of a judicial process, 

b) the presence of the individual is required exclusively for medical, safety or other 

humanitarian purposes, or c) the Committee has determined on a case -by-case basis 

that the expulsion of the individual would be contrary to the objectives of 

resolutions 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009), 2087 (2013), 2094 (2013) and this resolution;  

 14. Decides that, if a Member State determines that an individual who is not

individual or entity or assisting the evasion of sanctions or v iolating the provisions 

of resolutions 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009), 2087 (2013), 2094 (2013) or this 

resolution, then Member States shall expel the individual from their territories for 

the purpose of repatriation to the individual’s state of nationality, consistent with 

applicable national and international law, unless the presence of the individual is 

required for fulfilment of a judicial process or exclusively for medical, safety or 

other humanitarian purposes, or the Committee has determined on a case -by-case 

basis that the expulsion of the individual would be contrary to the objectives of 

resolutions 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009), 2087 (2013), 2094 (2013) or this resolution, 

provided that nothing in this paragraph shall impede the transit of representatives of 

the Government of the DPRK to the United Nations Headquarters or other UN 

facilities to conduct United Nations business;

imposed in paragraph 8 (d) of resolution 1718 (2006) and paragraphs 8 and 11 of 

resolution 2094 (2013), all Member States shall close the representative offices of 

designated entities and prohibit such entities, as well as individuals or entities acting 

for or on their behalf, directly or indirectly, from participating in joint ventures or 

any other business arrangements, and underscores that if a representative of such an 

office is a DPRK national, then States are required to expel the individual from their 

territories for the purpose of repatriation to the DPRK consistent with applicable 

national and international law, pursuant to and consistent with paragraph 10 of 

resolution 2094 (2013);

facilitated by the DPRK or its nationals, or by individuals or entities acting on their 

behalf or at their direction, or entities owned or controlled by them, or by 

designated individuals or entities, or that is being transported on DPRK flagged 

aircraft or maritime vessels, for the purposes of ensuring that no items are 

transferred in violation of resolutions 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009), 2087 (2013), 2094 

(2013) and this resolution, and calls upon States to implement such inspections in a

contributing to violations of the aforementioned resolutions;  

 20. Decides that all States shall prohibit their nationals, persons subject to 

their jurisdiction and entities incorporated in their territory or subject to their 

jurisdiction from registering vessels in the DPRK, obtaining authorization for a 

vessel to use the DPRK flag, and from owning, leasing, operating, providing any 

vessel classification, certification or associated service, or insuring any vessel 

flagged by the DPRK, and decides that this measure shall not apply to activities

2087 (2013), 2094 (2013) or this resolution;  

 21. Decides that all States shall deny permission to any aircraft to take off 

from, land in or overfly, unless under the condition of landing for inspection, their 

territory, if they have information that provides reasonable grounds to believe that 

the aircraft contains items the supply, sale, transfer or export of which is prohibited 

by resolutions 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009), 2087 (2013), 2094 (2013) or this

when considering whether to grant overflight permission to flights to assess known 

risk factors;  

 22. Decides that all Member States shall prohibit the entry into their ports of 

any vessel if the Member State has information that provides reasonable grounds to

other purposes consistent with the objectives of this resolution;  

 23. Recalls that the Committee has designated the DPRK firm Ocean 

Maritime Management (OMM), notes that the vessels specified in Annex III of this 

resolution are economic resources controlled or operated by OMM and therefore

underscores that Member States are required to implement the relevant provisions 

of that resolution;  

 24. Decides that the DPRK shall abandon all chemical and biological
