 Taking note of Human Rights Council decision 3/103 of 8 December 2006,2 by 
which, heeding the decision and instruction of the World Conference, the Council 
established the Ad Hoc Committee of the Human Rights Council on the Elaboration 
of Complementary Standards, and encouraging the Committee to continue making 
progress in the discharge of its mandate,  

 Bearing in mind the responsibility and obligations of the Human Rights 
Council emanating from the outcome of the Durban Review Conference,3 

 Reiterating that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights 
and have the potential to contribute constructively to the development and well-
being of their societies, and that any doctrine of racial superiority is scientifically 
false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and must be rejected, 
together with theories that attempt to determine the existence of separate human 
races,  

 Convinced that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance manifest themselves in a differentiated manner for women and girls and 
may be among the factors leading to a deterioration in their living conditions, 
poverty, violence, multiple forms of discrimination and the limitation or denial of 
their human rights, and recognizing the need to integrate a gender perspective into 
relevant policies, strategies and programmes of action against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in order to address multiple 
forms of discrimination,  

 Underlining the primacy of political will, international cooperation and 
adequate funding at the national, regional and international levels needed to address 
all forms and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance,  

 Emphasizing, while acknowledging the primary responsibility of States parties 
to implement their obligations under the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,4 that international cooperation 
and technical assistance play an important role in assisting countries with the 
implementation of their obligations under it, 

 Alarmed at the increase in racist violence and xenophobic ideas in many parts 
of the world, in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in society at 
large as a result, inter alia, of the resurgent activities of associations established on 
the basis of racist and xenophobic platforms and charters, and the persistent use of 
those platforms and charters to promote or incite racist ideologies,  

 Underlining the importance of urgently eliminating continuing and violent 
trends involving racism and racial discrimination, and conscious that any form of 
impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in 
weakening the rule of law and democracy, tends to encourage the recurrence of such 
crimes and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication,  

 Recognizing that individuals belonging to vulnerable groups, such as migrants, 
refugees, asylum-seekers and persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and

perpetrated or incited by extremist political parties, movements and groups,  

 Acknowledging the central role of resource mobilization, effective global 
partnership and international cooperation in the context of paragraphs 157 and 158 
of the Durban Programme of Action for the successful realization of commitments 
undertaken at the World Conference,  

 Expressing grave concern at the lack of progress made in the implementation 
of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, in particular key paragraphs 
157 to 159 of the Programme of Action,  

 Welcoming the continued commitment of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to profiling and increasing the visibility of the 
struggle against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 
and recognizing the need for the High Commissioner to make this a cross-cutting 
issue in the activities and programmes of her Office,  

 Welcoming also the work of the Intergovernmental Working Group on the 
Effective Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action at its 
seventh and eighth sessions, held from 5 to 16 October 20095 and from 11 to  
22 October 2010,6 respectively, and welcoming the adoption by the Human Rights 
Council of the conclusions and recommendations of the Working Group,  

 Welcoming further the progress made during the third session of the Ad Hoc 
Committee on the Elaboration of Complementary Standards, held in Geneva from 
11 to 21 April 2011, and looking forward to the convening of the fourth session, to 
be held in Geneva during 2012, 

 Welcoming the activities undertaken in the context of the International Year for 
People of African Descent, including the first World Summit of Afro-Descendants, 
held in La Ceiba, Honduras, in August 2011, and the high-level summit for people 
of African descent held in Salvador, Brazil, in November 2011 to mark the tenth 
anniversary of the Durban outcome, and looking forward to the African Diaspora 
Summit to be held in South Africa in 2012,  

 Recognizing the potential of sport as a universal language contributing to the 
education of people on the values of diversity, tolerance and fairness and as a means 
to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,  

 Welcoming the hosting of the 2010 and 2014 International Federation of 
Association Football World Cups in South Africa and Brazil, respectively, and 
stressing the importance of making continuing use of those events to promote 
understanding, tolerance and peace and to promote and strengthen efforts in the 
fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,

in this regard;

all religious communities, communities of people of African descent, communities 
of people of Asian descent, communities of indigenous people and other 
communities;  

 33. Calls upon States parties to fully implement legislation and other 
measures already in place to ensure that people of African descent are not

economic, political and social rights;

role of education, including human rights education, training and learning, and a 
variety of awareness-raising measures which contribute to the creation of tolerant 
societies in which mutual understanding may be ensured;  

 39. Also recommends that all States give due attention to and closely monitor 
the way in which the concept of national identity is debated within their societies, 
with a view to preventing it from being used as a tool to create artificial differences 
among some groups of the population;  

 40. Expresses concern at recent deeply marked tendencies within numerous 
societies to characterize migration as a problem and a threat to social cohesion, and 
in this context notes the numerous human rights challenges in combating racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance;  

 41. Recommends that States conduct human rights training, including on the 
challenges of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
faced by migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers, for law enforcement officials, 
especially immigration officials and border police, so that they may act in 
conformity with international human rights law;  

 42. Also recommends that States collect disaggregated data in order to design 
appropriate anti-racial discrimination legislation and policies and monitor their 
effectiveness, while abiding by some key principles, including self-identification, 
the right to privacy and guaranteeing the consent of those concerned, in the design 
and implementation of the exercise;
