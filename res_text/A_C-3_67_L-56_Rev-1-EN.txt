 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 52/111 of 12 December 1997, in which it decided to 
convene the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia 
and Related Intolerance, and its resolutions 56/266 of 27 March 2002, 57/195 of 
18 December 2002, 58/160 of 22 December 2003, 59/177 of 20 December 2004 and 
60/144 of 16 December 2005, which guided the comprehensive follow-up to and

the importance of their full and effective implementation,  

 Recalling also its resolutions 64/148 of 18 December 2009 and 65/240 of 
24 December 2010, in which it, inter alia, called for the commemoration of the tenth 
anniversary of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the 
World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related 
Intolerance,1 which represented an important opportunity for the international 
community to reaffirm its commitment to the eradication of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, including by mobilizing 
political will at the national, regional and international levels, with a view to 
achieving concrete results,  

 Recalling further the political declaration of the high-level meeting of the 
General Assembly to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the

Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted on 22 September 2011,2 
which reaffirmed the political commitment to the full and effective implementation 
of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and the outcome document of 
the Durban Review Conference,3 and their follow-up processes at the national, 
regional and international levels, 

 Recalling its resolution 66/144, in which it encouraged the Working Group of 
Experts on People of African Descent to develop a programme of action, including a 
theme, for adoption by the Human Rights Council, with a view to proclaiming the 
decade starting in 2013 the Decade for People of African Descent, 

 Taking note of Human Rights Council decision 3/103 of 8 December 2006,4 by 
which, heeding the decision and instruction of the World Conference, the Council 
established the Ad Hoc Committee of the Human Rights Council on the Elaboration 
of Complementary Standards, 

 Underlining the importance of Human Rights Council resolution 6/22 of 
28 September 2007,5 in which the Council deplored the lack of political will to 
translate the Durban commitments into concrete action and tangible results, 

 Bearing in mind the responsibility and commitments of the Human Rights 
Council emanating from the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference, 

 Reiterating that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights 
and have the potential to contribute constructively to the development and well-
being of their societies, and that any doctrine of racial superiority is scientifically 
false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and must be rejected, 
together with theories that attempt to determine the existence of separate human 
races,  

 Convinced that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance manifest themselves in a differentiated manner for women and girls and 
may be among the factors leading to a deterioration in their living conditions, 
poverty, violence, multiple forms of discrimination and the limitation or denial of 
their human rights, and recognizing the need to integrate a gender perspective into 
relevant policies, strategies and programmes of action against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in order to address multiple 
forms of discrimination,  

 Underlining the primacy of political will, international cooperation and 
adequate funding at the national, regional and international levels needed to address 
all forms and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance,  

 Stressing the importance of a consistent global effort to inform the public 
about the contribution that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action has 
made in the struggle against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance,

 Emphasizing, while acknowledging the primary responsibility of States parties 
to implement their obligations under the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,6 that international cooperation 
and technical assistance play an important role in assisting countries in the 
implementation of their obligations under the Convention,  

 Alarmed at the increase in racist violence and xenophobic ideas in many parts 
of the world, in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in society at 
large as a result, inter alia, of the resurgent activities of associations established on 
the basis of racist and xenophobic platforms and charters and the persistent use of 
those platforms and charters to promote or incite racist ideologies,  

 Underlining the importance of urgently eliminating continuing and violent 
trends involving racism and racial discrimination, and conscious that any form of 
impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in 
weakening the rule of law and democracy, tends to encourage the recurrence of such 
crimes and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication,  

 Recognizing that individuals belonging to vulnerable groups, such as migrants, 
refugees, asylum seekers and persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and 
linguistic minorities, continue to be the main victims of violence and attacks 
perpetrated or incited by extremist political parties, movements and groups that have 
a xenophobic and racist agenda,  

 Acknowledging the central role of resource mobilization, effective global 
partnership and international cooperation in the context of paragraphs 157 and 158 
of the Durban Programme of Action for the successful realization of the primary 
objectives and commitments undertaken at the World Conference,  

 Expressing grave concern that the principal objective of combating racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance has not been attained, in 
particular due to the lack of progress made in the implementation of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action, in particular key paragraphs 157 to 159 
thereof, and that countless human beings continue to be victims of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 

 Recognizing that poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion 
and economic disparities are closely associated with racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance and contribute to the persistence of racist 
attitudes and practices, which in turn generate more poverty,  

 Expressing concern that the current economic and financial crisis and its 
consequences on poverty and unemployment may have further contributed to the 
rise of extremist political parties, movements and groups and exacerbated 
identity-related issues, and that in this period of economic crisis, non-citizens, 
members of minorities, migrants, refugees and asylum seekers are still the main 
scapegoats of extremist political parties that have a xenophobic and racist agenda 
and that sometimes incite racial discrimination and violence against them,  

 Welcoming the continued commitment of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to profiling and increasing the visibility of the 
struggle against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,

and recognizing the need for the High Commissioner to make this a cross-cutting 
issue in the activities and programmes of her Office,  

 Expressing concern at manifestations of intolerance based on religion or belief 
that can generate hatred and violence among individuals composing different 
nations, and in this regard emphasizing the importance of respect for religious and 
cultural diversity, as well as interfaith and intercultural dialogue, which contribute 
to promoting a culture of tolerance and respect among individuals, societies and 
nations,  

 Taking note of the work done and the progress made during the ninth and tenth 
sessions of the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective Implementation 
of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, held from 17 to 28 October 
20117 and from 8 to 19 October 2012, and the fourth session of the Ad Hoc 
Committee on the Elaboration of Complementary Standards, held from 10 to 
12 April 2012,8  

 Taking note also of the declaration of the Global African Diaspora Summit, 
held in Sandton, Johannesburg, on 25 May 2012,  

 Taking note further of general recommendation No. 34 adopted by the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination at its seventy-ninth session, 
held from 8 August to 2 September 2011,9 addressing racial discrimination against 
people of African descent,  

 Recognizing the potential of sport as a universal language contributing to the 
education of people on the values of diversity, tolerance and fairness and as a means 
to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,  

 Deeply concerned that, despite the immense potential of sport for promoting 
tolerance, racism in sport is still a serious problem, 

 Welcoming the hosting of the 2010 and 2014 International Federation of 
Association Football World Cups in South Africa and Brazil, respectively, and 
stressing the importance of making continuing use of those events to promote 
understanding, tolerance and peace and to promote and strengthen efforts in the 
fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,

intolerance, thereby contributing to the prevention of human rights violations;  

 10. Also recognizes that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance occur on the grounds of race, colour, descent or national or

discrimination based on other related grounds, such as sex, language, religion or 
belief, political or other opinion, social origin, property and birth or other status;  

 11. Reaffirms that any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that 
constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by

incitement to such acts, shall be declared offences punishable by law, in accordance

A/C.3/67/L.56/Rev.1  
 

12-60700 6 
 

 12. Underlines the imperative need to address all the contemporary forms 
and manifestations of racial discrimination, taking into account the object and

paragraph 147 of the Durban Programme of Action, to take all measures necessary 
to combat incitement to violence motivated by racial hatred, including through the 
misuse of print, audiovisual and electronic media and new communications 
technologies, and, in collaboration with service providers, to promote the use of 
such technologies, including the Internet, to contribute to the fight against racism, in 
conformity with international standards of freedom of expression and taking all 
measures necessary to guarantee that right; 

 16. Encourages all States to include in their educational curricula and social

 19. Notes with appreciation the thematic debate on hate speech held during 
the eighty-first session of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination;

Programme of Action, and calls upon those States that have not yet done so to 
accede to the Convention as a matter of urgency;  

 21. Urges, in the above context, the Office of the United Nations High

encourage those countries to ratify it at the earliest possible time;  

 22. Expresses concern at the serious delays in the submission of overdue 
reports to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which impede

the provision of technical assistance to requesting countries in the preparation of

 26. Welcomes the work of the Committee in combating racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in the follow-up to the World

Intolerance and the measures recommended to strengthen the implementation of the 
Convention as well as the functioning of the Committee;  

 27. Encourages all Member States to consider verifying whether the absence 
of complaints of racial discrimination is not the result of the victims’ lack of 
awareness of their rights, fear of reprisals, limited access to remedies, or lack of 
confidence in the law enforcement authorities, or to the lack of attention or 
sensitivity on the part of the law enforcement authorities to cases of racial 
discrimination, and to pay particular attention to the challenges faced by victims in 
accessing justice;13

 28. Calls upon Member States to do their utmost to ensure that their 
responses to the current financial and economic crisis do not lead to increased 
poverty and underdevelopment and, potentially, a rise in racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance against foreigners, immigrants

over the world;  

 29. Reaffirms that deprivation of citizenship on the basis of race or descent is

xenophobia and related intolerance, and follow-up to his visits

forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,14 and 
encourages relevant stakeholders to consider implementing the recommendations 
contained therein;

organizations to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur, and calls upon States 
to consider responding favourably to his requests for visits so as to enable him to 
fulfil his mandate fully and effectively;  

 33. Reaffirms that any form of impunity condoned by public authorities for 
crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the 
rule of law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such acts;  

 34. Emphasizes the obligations of States under international law to exercise 
due diligence to prevent crimes against migrants perpetrated with racist or 
xenophobic motivations, to investigate such crimes and to punish the perpetrators 
and that not doing so violates, and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of, the human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of victims, and urges States to reinforce measures 
in this regard; 

 35. Recognizes with deep concern the increase in anti-Semitism, 
Christianophobia and Islamophobia in various parts of the world, as well as the 
emergence of racial and violent movements based on racism and discriminatory 
ideas directed against Arab, Christian, Jewish and Muslim communities, as well as 
all religious communities, communities of people of African descent, communities 
of people of Asian descent, communities of indigenous people and other 
communities;

 36. Calls upon States parties to fully implement legislation and other 
measures already in place to ensure the elimination of all forms of racism, notably 
against people of African descent;16 

 37. Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
continue to provide States, at their request, with advisory services and technical 
assistance to enable them to implement fully the recommendations of the Special 
Rapporteur;  

 38. Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with 
all the human and financial assistance necessary to carry out his mandate efficiently, 
effectively and expeditiously and to enable him to submit a report to the General 
Assembly at its sixty-eighth session;  

 39. Requests the Special Rapporteur, within his mandate, to continue giving 
particular attention to the negative impact of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance on the full enjoyment of civil, cultural, 
economic, political and social rights;  

 40. Invites Member States to demonstrate greater commitment to fighting 
racism in sport by conducting educational and awareness-raising activities and by 
strongly condemning the perpetrators of racist incidents, in cooperation with 
national and international sports organizations;  

 41. Strongly condemns all forms of intolerance and of discrimination based 
on religion or belief, as well as violations of freedom of thought, conscience and 
religion or belief; 

 42. Recommends that States engage in broad efforts to eliminate racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and to promote respect for 
cultural, ethnic and religious diversity, and in that regard emphasizes the crucial role 
of education, including human rights education, training and learning, and a variety 
of awareness-raising measures that contribute to the creation of tolerant societies in 
which mutual understanding may be ensured;  

 43. Also recommends that all States give due attention to and closely monitor 
the way in which the concept of national, cultural and religious identity is debated 
within their societies, with a view to preventing it from being used as a tool to 
create artificial differences among some groups of the population;  

 44. Expresses concern at recent deeply marked tendencies within numerous 
societies to characterize migration as a problem and a threat to social cohesion, and 
in this context notes the numerous human rights challenges in combating racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance;  

 45. Recommends that States conduct human rights training, including on the 
challenges of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
faced by migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, for law enforcement officials, 
especially immigration officials and border police, so that they may act in 
conformity with international human rights law;  

 46. Also recommends that States consider collecting ethnically disaggregated 
data with a view to setting up concrete targets and designing appropriate and

effective anti-discrimination legislation, policies and programmes aimed at 
promoting equality, preventing and eliminating racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance; any such information should, as appropriate, be 
collected with the explicit consent of individuals, based on their self-determination 
and in accordance with provisions of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as 
well as data protection regulations and privacy guarantees; this information must not 
be misused;  

 47. Invites the Special Rapporteur to consider examining domestic models of 
mechanisms that measure racial equality and their added value in the eradication of 
racial discrimination, and to report on such challenges, successes and best practices 
in his next report; 

 48. Encourages those States that have not enacted legislation to combat and 
prevent racial, ethnic and xenophobic hatred through the Internet to consider the 
enactment of such legislation, in conformity with international standards on freedom 
of expression and taking all measures necessary to guarantee that right, taking into 
account that combating the use of the Internet to propagate racial, ethnic and 
xenophobic content and incitement to violence requires a multi-stakeholder 
approach which involves the private sector, in particular Internet service providers 
and other relevant industry players; 

 49. Encourages States to promote the opportunities provided by the Internet 
and social media to counter the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or 
hatred and to promote equality, non-discrimination and respect for diversity; 

 50. Strongly condemns any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred 
that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, whether it 
involves the use of print, audiovisual or electronic media or any other means, and in 
this regard emphasizes that respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
including freedom of religion or belief, and for cultural and religious diversity is an 
essential element for creating an environment free from racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and contributes to the global 
efforts to combat all forms of discrimination;  
 

  IV 
Outcomes of the 2001 World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination,
