  The risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Bearing in mind its relevant resolutions, 

 Taking note of the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Conference of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency, the latest of which is resolution 
GC(50)/RES/16, adopted on 22 September 2006,1 

 Cognizant that the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the region of the Middle 
East would pose a serious threat to international peace and security, 

 Mindful of the immediate need for placing all nuclear facilities in the region of 
the Middle East under full-scope safeguards of the Agency, 

 Recalling the decision on principles and objectives for nuclear  
non-proliferation and disarmament adopted by the 1995 Review and Extension 
Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 
on 11 May 1995,2 in which the Conference urged universal adherence to the Treaty3 
as an urgent priority and called upon all States not yet parties to the Treaty to accede 
to it at the earliest date, particularly those States that operate unsafeguarded nuclear 
facilities, 

 Recognizing with satisfaction that, in the Final Document of the 2000 Review 
Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons, the Conference undertook to make determined efforts towards the

achievement of the goal of universality of the Treaty, called upon those remaining 
States not parties to the Treaty to accede to it, thereby accepting an international 
legally binding commitment not to acquire nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive 
devices and to accept Agency safeguards on all their nuclear activities, and 
underlined the necessity of universal adherence to the Treaty and of strict 
compliance by all parties with their obligations under the Treaty,4  

 Recalling the resolution on the Middle East adopted by the 1995 Review and 
Extension Conference on 11 May 1995,2 in which the Conference noted with 
concern the continued existence in the Middle East of unsafeguarded nuclear 
facilities, reaffirmed the importance of the early realization of universal adherence 
to the Treaty and called upon all States in the Middle East that had not yet done so, 
without exception, to accede to the Treaty as soon as possible and to place all their 
nuclear facilities under full-scope Agency safeguards, 

 Noting that Israel remains the only State in the Middle East that has not yet 
become party to the Treaty, 

 Concerned about the threats posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons to 
the security and stability of the Middle East region, 

 Stressing the importance of taking confidence-building measures, in particular 
the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, in order to 
enhance peace and security in the region and to consolidate the global  
non-proliferation regime, 

 Emphasizing the need for all parties directly concerned to consider seriously 
taking the practical and urgent steps required for the implementation of the proposal 
to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region of the Middle East in 
accordance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and, as a means of 
promoting this objective, inviting the countries concerned to adhere to the Treaty 
and, pending the establishment of the zone, to agree to place all their nuclear 
activities under Agency safeguards, 

 Noting that one hundred and seventy-six States have signed the 
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,5 including a number of States in the 
region, 

 1. Welcomes the conclusions on the Middle East of the 2000 Review 
Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons;6 

 2. Reaffirms the importance of Israel’s accession to the Treaty on the  
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons3 and placement of all its nuclear facilities 
under comprehensive International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, in realizing 
the goal of universal adherence to the Treaty in the Middle East;
