 Recognizing that the COVID-19 pandemic is one of the greatest global 

challenges in the history of the United Nations, and noting with deep concern its 

impact on health and the loss of life, mental health and well-being, as well as the 

negative impact on global humanitarian needs, the enjoyment of human rights and 

across all spheres of society, including on livelihoods, food security and nutrition, 

and education, the exacerbation of poverty and hunger, disruption to economies, 

trade, societies and environments, and the exacerbation of economic and social 

inequalities within and among countries, which is reversing hard-won development 

gains and hampering progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda and all its Goals 

and targets, 

 Acknowledging that the COVID-19 pandemic calls for continued leadership, 

multilateral commitment and collaboration, among Member States and with relevant 

United Nations entities, especially with the World Health Organization, and other 

relevant international organizations, to implement robust national responses, while 

also recognizing the key leadership role of the World Health Organization within the 

broader United Nations response,

Agenda, 

 Underscoring that investments in health systems aligned with the 2030 Agenda 

are key to advancing prosperity and development and alleviating poverty, including 

for employment, trade, supply chains and travel, and underscoring also the need for 

sustained attention, commitment and closer cooperation, including partnership for 

global health, to ensure the promotion of effective implementation of universal health 

coverage on the basis of solidarity at the national, regional and international levels,  

 Underlining the urgency of having strong and resilient health systems, reaching 

those who are vulnerable or in vulnerable situations and capable of effectively 

implementing the International Health Regulations (2005) 13 in the context of health 

emergencies, ensuring pandemic preparedness and the prevention and detection of 

and response to any outbreaks, infectious disease and other health threats,  

 Recognizing the need to enhance cooperation at the national, regional and global 

levels to address antimicrobial resistance, using an integrated and systems-based One 

Health approach, and in this regard welcoming the launch of the One Health Global 

Leaders Group on Antimicrobial Resistance,  

 Recognizing also that the COVID-19 pandemic has a disproportionately heavy 

impact on the poor and the most vulnerable, with repercussions on health and 

development gains, thus hampering the achievement of the Sustainable Development 

Goals and universal health coverage,  

 Expressing deep concern about the rise in discrimination, hate speech, 

stigmatization, racism and xenophobia related to the pandemic, and stressing the need 

to counter them as part of the COVID-19 response,

the increased challenges to holding perpetrators accountable, which also affect front -

line health workers and community health volunteers,  

 Noting that the increasing number of complex emergencies is hindering the 

achievement of universal health coverage and that coherent and inclusive approaches 

to safeguard universal health coverage in emergencies are essential, including through 

international cooperation, ensuring the continuum and provision of essential health 

services and public health functions, in line with humanitarian principles,  

 Emphasizing the need for all States parties to fully implement and comply with 

the International Health Regulations (2005), and stressing the importance of the 

adequate capacity of all countries to prevent, detect, assess, notify and respond to 

public health threats, and support research and development, to prevent and control 

emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases that pose a risk to global public health,  

 Acknowledging that primary health care is the most inclusive, effective and 

efficient approach to enhance people’s physical and mental health, as well as social 

well-being, and that primary health care is a cornerstone of a sustainable health 

system for universal health coverage and health-related Sustainable Development 

Goals, as recognized in the Declaration of Astana,

initiative as well as other relevant initiatives, which aim to accelerate development 

and production of and equitable access to COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics and 

vaccines to all countries that need them, and to strengthen health systems, without 

undermining incentives for innovation, 

 Recognizing the role of extensive immunization against COVID-19 as a global 

public good for health in preventing, containing and stopping transmission in order 

to bring the pandemic to an end once safe, quality, efficacious, effective, ac cessible 

and affordable vaccines are available,  

 Noting with concern that non-communicable diseases, notably cardiovascular 

diseases, cancers, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, as well as mental disorders, 

other mental health conditions and neurological disorders, are the leading causes of 

premature death and disability globally, including in low- and middle-income 

countries, and that people living with non-communicable diseases are more 

susceptible to the risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms and are among the 

most affected by the pandemic, and recognizing that necessary prevention and control 

efforts are hampered by, inter alia, lack of universal access to quality, safe, effective, 

affordable essential health services, medicines, diagnostics and health technologies, 

as well as a global shortage of qualified health workers,  

 Recognizing the need to tackle health inequities and inequalities within and 

among countries through political commitment, policies and international 

cooperation, including those that address social, economic, environmental and other 

determinants of health, 

 Underlining the importance of developing efficient and innovative approaches, 

including through the private sector and foreign direct investment, to address the 

health needs of the most vulnerable, help to create more resilient health-care systems 

and achieve universal health coverage, while also recognizing the instrumental role 

that foreign direct investment plays in ensuring that national health priorities are 

achieved, including equality of access, 

 Recognizing that people’s engagement, particularly of women and girls, families 

and communities, and the inclusion of all relevant stakeholders is one of the core 

components of health system governance, to fully empower all people in improving 

and protecting their own health, giving due regard to addressing and managing

5/9 20-16324 

 

conflicts of interest and undue influence, contributing to the achievement of universal 

health coverage for all, with a focus on health outcomes,  

 Emphasizing that illicit financial flows, in particular those caused by tax 

evasion, corruption and transnational organized crime, reduce the availability of vital 

resources for responding to and recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and 

financing the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, 

 Recalling the World Health Organization Global Strategy and Plan of Action on 

Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property, 14 designed to promote medicinal 

innovation, build capacity and improve access to medicines, and encouraging further 

discussions on access to medicines,  

 Reaffirming the right to use, to the fullest extent the provisions contained in the 

World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual 

Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), which provides flexibilities for the protection 

of public health and promotes access to medicines for all, in particular for developing 

countries, and the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, 

which recognizes that intellectual property protection is important for the 

development of new medicines and also recognizes the concerns about its effects on 

prices,
