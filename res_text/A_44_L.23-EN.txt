General Assembly resolution 43/19, 11

Deploring foreign armed intervention and occupation in Kampuchea, the cause of
continuing hostilities in that country, seriously threatening international peace
and security,

Noting the continued and effective struggle of the Kampuchean people under the
leadership of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk to achieve the independence, sovereignty,
territorial integrity and neutral and non-aligned status of Kampuchea,

Taking note of Economic and Social Council decision 1989/156 of 24 May 1989 on
the right of peoples to self-determination and its application to peoples under
colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation,

Greatly disturbed that the continued fighting and instability iu Kampuchea
have forced an additional large number of Kampucheans to flee to the
Thai-Kampuchean border in search of food and safety,

Recognizing that the assistance extended by the international community has
continued to reduce the food shortages and health problems of the Kampuchean people,

Emphasizing that it is the inalienable right of the Kampuchean people who have
sought refuge in neighbouring countries to return safely to their homeland,

Emphasizing also that no effective solution to the humanitarian problems can
be achieved without a comprehensive political settlement of the Kampuchean conflict,

Seriously concerned about reported demographic changes imposed in Kampuchea as
a result of foreign occupation,

Convinced thdt, to bring about lasting peace in South-East Asia and reduce the
threat to international peace and security, there is an urgent need for the
international community to find a comprehensive political settlement of the
Kampuchean problem, with effective guarantees, that must include the total
withdrawal Of all foreign forces from Kampuchea under supervision and control of
the United Nations and will provide for the creation of an i~terim administering
authority, the promotion of national reconciliation among all Kampucheans under the
leadership of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, the non-return to the universally condemned
policies and practices of a recent past and ensure respect for the sovereignty,
independence, territorial integrity and neutral and non-aligned status of
Kampuchea, as well as the right of the Kampuchean people to self-determination free
from outside interference,
