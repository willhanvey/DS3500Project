 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 2029 (XX) of 22 November 1965, by which it 

established the Governing Council of the United Nations Development Programme,  

 Recalling also its resolution 3019 (XXVII) of 18 December 1972, by which it 

decided that the Governing Council of the United Nations Development Programme 

should be the governing body of the United Nations Fund for Population Activities,  

 Recalling further its resolution 48/162 of 20 December 1993, by which it 

decided that the governing bodies of the United Nations Development 

Programme/the United Nations Population Fund and the United Nations Children ’s 

Fund should be transformed into Executive Boards,  

 Recalling its decision 48/501 of 19 September 1994, by which it decided that 

the United Nations Office for Project Services should become a separate and 

identifiable entity, 

 Recalling also its resolution 65/176 of 20 December 2010, by which it decided 

that the name of the Executive Board of the United Nations Development 

Programme/United Nations Population Fund should be changed to “Executive 

Board of the United Nations Development Programme/United Nations Population 

Fund/United Nations Office for Project Services”, 

 Recalling further its resolution 40/243 of 18 December 1985, by which it 

decided that the regular sessions of the Governing Council, now the Executive 

Board, of the United Nations Development Programme should be held alternately at 

United Nations Headquarters and at the United Nations Office at Geneva,

15-10636 2/2 

 

 Recalling its resolutions 61/16 of 20 November 2006 and 68/1 of 

20 September 2013 on the strengthening of the Economic and Social Council,  

 Recognizing that the participation of developing countries in the sessions of 

the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme held in Geneva 

has been significantly less than that in those held in New York,  

 Noting the comparatively larger presence of missions from developing 

countries in New York, 

 Recognizing that the primary programming constituents of the United Nations 

development system continue to be developing countries,  

 Recognizing also the large financial burden that the current system of 

alternating Executive Board sessions between New York and Geneva places on both 

developing countries and the United Nations Development Programme,  

 Noting that holding the Executive Board sessions in New York would present 

significant cost savings to the core resources of the United Nations Development 

Programme, which could then be utilized for programming activities of the United 

Nations development system, 

 1. Decides that all annual sessions of the Executive Board of the United 

Nations Development Programme will henceforth be held at United Nations 

Headquarters in New York; 

 2. Requests the United Nations Development Programme to continue the 

existing arrangements to facilitate the participation of least developed countries and 

landlocked developing countries in the annual sessions to be held in New York.
