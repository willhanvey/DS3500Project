sectors in developing countries to enable them to participate more effectively in and 

benefit from the process of globalization,  

 Realizing the need to undertake a thorough, independent and comprehensive 

assessment of the social, environmental and cultural impact of globalizat ion on 

societies,  

 Recognizing in each culture a dignity and value that deserve recognition, 

respect and preservation, convinced that, in their rich variety and diversity and in 

the reciprocal influences that they exert on one another, all cultures form pa rt of the 

common heritage belonging to all humankind, and aware of the risk that 

globalization poses more of a threat to cultural diversity if the developing world 

remains poor and marginalized,  

 Recognizing also that multilateral mechanisms have a unique role to play in 

meeting the challenges and opportunities presented by globalization,   

 Realizing the need to consider the challenges and opportunities linked to 

globalization with a view to addressing such challenges and building on possible 

opportunities in order to achieve the full enjoyment of all human rights,   

 Emphasizing the global character of the migratory phenomenon, the 

importance of international, regional and bilateral cooperation and the need to 

protect the human rights of migrants, particularly at a time when migration flows 

have increased in the globalized economy,  

 Expressing grave concern at the negative impact of international financial 

turmoil on social and economic development and on the full enjoyment of all human 

rights, particularly in the light of the continuing global financial and economic 

crisis, which may have an adverse impact on the ability of Member States to 

implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and recognizing that 

developing countries are in a more vulnerable situation when facing such impact 

and that regional economic cooperation and development strategies and programmes 

can play a role in mitigating such impact,  

 Expressing deep concern at the negative impact of the continuing global food 

and energy crises and climate change challenges on social and economic 

development and on the full enjoyment of all human rights for all,   

 Recognizing that globalization should be guided by the fundamental principles 

that underpin the corpus of human rights, such as equity, participation, 

accountability, non-discrimination, transparency, inclusivity and equality at both the 

national and the international levels, respect for diversity, tolerance and 

international cooperation and solidarity,  

 Emphasizing that the existence of widespread extreme poverty inhibits the full 

realization and effective enjoyment of human rights and that its immediate 

alleviation and eventual elimination must remain a high priority for the international 

community,  

 Acknowledging that there is greater acceptance that the increasing debt burden 

faced by the most indebted developing countries is unsustainable and constitutes 

one of the principal obstacles to achieving sustainable development and poverty 

eradication and that, for many developing countries, excessive debt servicing has 

severely constrained their capacity to promote social development and to provide 

basic services to realize economic, social and cultural rights,   

 Strongly reiterating the determination to ensure the timely and full realization 

of the sustainable development goals and objectives agreed at the major United 

Nations conferences and summits, including those agreed at the United Nations 



A/C.3/72/L.52

summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, which aim to 

galvanize efforts towards poverty eradication,  

 Gravely concerned at the inadequacy of measures to narrow the widening gap 

between the developed and the developing countries, and within countries, which 

has contributed to, inter alia, deepening poverty and has adversely affected the  full 

enjoyment of all human rights, in particular in developing countries,   

 Emphasizing that transnational corporations and other business enterprises 

have a responsibility to respect all human rights,   

 Emphasizing also that human beings strive for a world that is respectful of 

human rights and cultural diversity and that, in this regard, they work to ensure that 

all activities, including those affected by globalization, are consistent with those aims,   

 1. Welcomes the adoption by the Heads of State and Government and High 

Representatives, meeting at United Nations Headquarters in New York from 25 to 

27 September 2015, of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development;
15

  

 2. Recognizes that, while globalization, through its impact on, inter alia, the 

role of the State, may affect human rights, the promotion and protection of all 

human rights is first and foremost the responsibility of the State;   

 3. Emphasizes that development should be at the centre of the international 

economic agenda and that coherence between national development strategies and 

international obligations and commitments is imperative for an enabling 

environment for development and an inclusive and equitable globalization;   

 4. Reaffirms that narrowing the gap between rich and poor, both within and 

between countries, is an explicit goal at the national and international levels, as part 

of the effort to create an enabling environment for the full enjoyment of all human 

rights;  

 5. Also reaffirms the commitment to create an environment at both the 

national and the global levels that is conducive to development and to the 

eradication of poverty by, inter alia, promoting good governance within each 

country and at the international level, eliminating protectionism, enhancing 

transparency in the financial, monetary and trading systems and committing to an 

open, equitable, rules-based, predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading 

and financial system;  

 6. Recognizes the impacts that the global financial and economic crisis is 

still having on the ability of countries, particularly developing countries, to mobilize 

resources for development and to address the impact of this crisis, and in this 

context calls upon all States and the international community to alleviate, in an 

inclusive and development-oriented manner, any negative impacts of this crisis on 

the realization and the effective enjoyment of all human rights;   

 7. Also recognizes that, while globalization offers great opportunities, the 

fact that its benefits are very unevenly shared and its costs unevenly distributed 

represents an aspect of the process that affects the full enjoyment of all human 

rights, in particular in developing countries;  

 8. Welcomes the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for 

Human Rights on globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of human 

rights,
16

 which focuses on the liberalization of agricultural trade and its impact on

the realization of the right to development, including the right to food, and takes 

note of the conclusions and recommendations contained therein;   

 9. Reaffirms the international commitment to eliminating hunger and to 

securing food for all, today and tomorrow, and reiterates that the relevant United 

Nations organizations should be assured the resources needed to expand and 

enhance their food assistance and support social safety net programmes designed to 

address hunger and malnutrition, when appropriate, through the use of local or 

regional purchase;  

 10. Calls upon Member States, relevant agencies of the United Nations 

system, intergovernmental organizations and civil society to promote inclusive, 

equitable and environmentally sustainable economic growth for managing 

globalization so that poverty is systematically reduced and the international 

development targets are achieved;  

 11. Recognizes that the responsible operations of transnational corporations 

and other business enterprises can contribute to the promotion, protection and 

fulfilment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular economic, 

social and cultural rights;  

 12. Also recognizes that only through broad and sustained efforts, including 

policies and measures at the global level to create a shared future based upon our 

common humanity in all its diversity, can globalization be made fully inclusive and 

equitable and have a human face, thus contributing to the full enjoyment of all 

human rights;  

 13. Underlines the urgent need to establish an equitable, transparent and 

democratic international system to strengthen and broaden the participation of 

developing countries in international economic decision-making and norm-setting;  

 14. Affirms that globalization is a complex process of structural 

transformation, with numerous interdisciplinary aspects, which has an impact on the 

enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right 

to development;  

 15. Also affirms that the international community should strive to respond to 

the challenges and opportunities posed by globalization in a manner that promotes 

and protects human rights while ensuring respect for the cultural diversity of all;   

 16. Underlines, therefore, the need to continue to analyse the consequences 

of globalization for the full enjoyment of all human rights;   

 17. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General,
17

 and requests him to 

continue to seek further the views of Member States and relevant agencies of the 

United Nations system and to submit to the General Assembly at its seventy -third 

session a substantive report on the subject based on those views, including 

recommendations on ways to address the impact of globalization on the full 

enjoyment of all human rights.
