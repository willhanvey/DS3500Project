eradication, pursuant to Millennium Development Goal 1, and therefore calling 
upon the international community, including the Human Rights Council, to 
contribute towards achieving that goal,  

 Recognizing further that historical injustices have undeniably contributed to 
the poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion, economic disparity, 
instability and insecurity that affect many people in different parts of the world, in 
particular in developing countries,  

 Stressing that poverty eradication is one of the critical elements in the 
promotion and realization of the right to development and that poverty is a 
multifaceted problem that requires a multifaceted and integrated approach in 
addressing economic, political, social, environmental and institutional dimensions at 
all levels, especially in the context of the Millennium Development Goal of halving, 
by 2015, the proportion of the world’s people whose income is less than one dollar a 
day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger,

seven working days and submit its reports to the Working Group; 

 4. Emphasizes the relevant provisions of General Assembly resolution

the Millennium Development Goals, and also in this regard to lead to raising the 
right to development, as set out in paragraphs 5 and 10 of the Vienna Declaration 
and Programme of Action,3 to the same level and on a par with all other human 
rights and fundamental freedoms;  

 5. Notes with appreciation that the high-level task force, at its second

 6. Endorses the recommendations of the Working Group, as outlined in 
paragraphs 44 to 46 of its report,8 which would ensure that the right to development 
criteria and corresponding operational subcriteria, to be submitted by the task force 
to the Working Group at its eleventh session in 2010, together with suggestions for 
further work, address, in a comprehensive and coherent manner, the essential 
features of the right to development, as defined in the Declaration on the Right to 
Development, including the priority concerns of the international community 
beyond those enumerated in Millennium Development Goal 8;  

 7. Stresses that the above criteria and corresponding operational subcriteria, 
once considered, revised and endorsed by the Working Group, should be used, as 
appropriate, in the elaboration of a comprehensive and coherent set of standards for 
the implementation of the right to development; 

 8. Emphasizes the importance that, upon completion of the three phases of 
the 2008-2010 workplan of the high-level task force on the implementation of the 
right to development endorsed by the Council in its resolution 9/3, the Working 
Group takes appropriate steps to ensure respect for and practical application of the 
above-mentioned standards, which could take various forms, including the 
elaboration of guidelines on the implementation of the right to development, and 
which could evolve into a basis for consideration of an international legal standard 
of a binding nature, through a collaborative process of engagement;  

 9. Stresses the importance of the core principles contained in the 
conclusions of the Working Group at its third session,13 congruent with the purpose 
of international human rights instruments, such as equality, non-discrimination, 
accountability, participation and international cooperation, as critical to 
mainstreaming the right to development at the national and international levels, and 
underlines the importance of the principles of equity and transparency;  

 10. Also stresses that it is important that the high-level task force and the 
Working Group, in the discharge of their mandates, take into account the need:  

 (a) To promote the democratization of the system of international 
governance in order to increase the effective participation of developing countries in 
international decision-making; 

 (b) To also promote effective partnerships such as the New Partnership for 
Africa’s Development10 and other similar initiatives with the developing countries, 
particularly the least developed countries, for the purpose of the realization of their 
right to development, including the achievement of the Millennium Development 
Goals;  

 (c) To strive for greater acceptance, operationalization and realization of the 
right to development at the international level, while urging all States to undertake 
at the national level the necessary policy formulation and to institute the measures 
required for the implementation of the right to development as an integral part of 
fundamental human rights, and also urging all States to expand and deepen mutually 
beneficial cooperation in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to 
development in the context of promoting effective international cooperation for the 
realization of the right to development, bearing in mind that lasting progress 
towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective

development policies at the national level and a favourable economic environment 
at the international level;  

 (d) To consider ways and means to continue to ensure the operationalization 
of the right to development as a priority;  

 (e) To mainstream the right to development in the policies and operational 
activities of the United Nations and the specialized agencies, programmes and 
funds, as well as in the policies and strategies of the international financial and 
multilateral trading systems, taking into account in this regard that the core 
principles of the international economic, commercial and financial spheres, such as 
equity, non-discrimination, transparency, accountability, participation and 
international cooperation, including effective partnerships for development, are 
indispensable in achieving the right to development and preventing discriminatory 
treatment arising from political or other non-economic considerations, in addressing 
the issues of concern to the developing countries;  

 11. Encourages the Human Rights Council to consider how to ensure follow-
up to the ongoing work of the former Subcommission on the Promotion and

relevant provisions of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the 
Commission on Human Rights and in compliance with decisions to be taken by the 
Human Rights Council; 

 12. Invites Member States and all other stakeholders to participate actively in 
future sessions of the Social Forum, while recognizing the strong support extended

and Protection of Human Rights;  

 13. Reaffirms the commitment to implement the goals and targets set out in 
all the outcome documents of the major United Nations conferences and summits 
and their review processes, in particular those relating to the realization of the right 
to development, recognizing that the realization of the right to development is 
critical to achieving the objectives, goals and targets set in those outcome 
documents;  

 14. Also reaffirms that the realization of the right to development is essential 
to the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which 
regards all human rights as universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, 
places the human person at the centre of development and recognizes that, while 
development facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights, the lack of development 
may not be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally recognized human 
rights;  

 15. Stresses that the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection 
of all human rights lies with the State, and reaffirms that States have the primary 
responsibility for their own economic and social development and that the role of 
national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized;  

 16. Reaffirms the primary responsibility of States to create national and 
international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to development, as 
well as their commitment to cooperate with each other to that end;  

 17. Also reaffirms the need for an international environment that is 
conducive to the realization of the right to development;

 19. Emphasizes the critical importance of identifying and analysing obstacles 
impeding the full realization of the right to development at both the national and the 
international levels;  

 20. Affirms that, while globalization offers both opportunities and challenges, 
the process of globalization remains deficient in achieving the objectives of 
integrating all countries into a globalized world, and stresses the need for policies 
and measures at the national and global levels to respond to the challenges and 
opportunities of globalization if this process is to be made fully inclusive and 
equitable;  

 21. Recognizes that, despite continuous efforts on the part of the 
international community, the gap between developed and developing countries 
remains unacceptably wide, that most of the developing countries continue to face 
difficulties in participating in the globalization process and that many risk being 
marginalized and effectively excluded from its benefits;  

 22. Expresses its deep concern in this regard at the negative impact on the 
realization of the right to development owing to the further aggravation of the 
economic and social situation, in particular of developing countries, as a result of 
the ongoing international energy, food and financial crises as well as global climate 
change; 

 23. Underlines the fact that the international community is far from meeting 
the target set in the United Nations Millennium Declaration4 of halving the number 
of people living in poverty by 2015, reaffirms the commitment made to meet that 
target, and emphasizes the principle of international cooperation, including 
partnership and commitment, between developed and developing countries towards 
achieving the goal;  

 24. Urges developed countries that have not yet done so to make concrete 
efforts towards meeting the targets of 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product 
for official development assistance to developing countries and 0.15 to 0.2 per cent 
of their gross domestic product to least developed countries, and encourages 
developing countries to build on the progress achieved in ensuring that official 
development assistance is used effectively to help meet development goals and 
targets;  

 25. Recognizes the need to address market access for developing countries, 
including in agriculture, services and non-agricultural products, in particular those 
of interest to developing countries;  

 26. Calls for the implementation of a desirable pace of meaningful trade 
liberalization, including in areas under negotiation in the World Trade Organization; 
the implementation of commitments on implementation-related issues and concerns; 
a review of special and differential treatment provisions, with a view to 
strengthening them and making them more precise, effective and operational; the 
avoidance of new forms of protectionism; and capacity-building and technical

assistance for developing countries as important issues in making progress towards 
the effective implementation of the right to development;  

 27. Recognizes the important link between the international economic, 
commercial and financial spheres and the realization of the right to development; 
stresses, in this regard, the need for good governance and broadening the base of 
decision-making at the international level on issues of development concern and the 
need to fill organizational gaps, as well as to strengthen the United Nations system 
and other multilateral institutions; and also stresses the need to broaden and 
strengthen the participation of developing countries and countries with economies in 
transition in international economic decision-making and norm-setting;  

 28. Also recognizes that good governance and the rule of law at the national 
level assist all States in the promotion and protection of human rights, including the 
right to development, and agrees on the value of the ongoing efforts being made by 
States to identify and strengthen good governance practices, including transparent, 
responsible, accountable and participatory government, that are responsive and 
appropriate to their needs and aspirations, including in the context of agreed 
partnership approaches to development, capacity-building and technical assistance;  

 29. Further recognizes the important role and the rights of women and the 
application of a gender perspective as a cross-cutting issue in the process of 
realizing the right to development, and notes in particular the positive relationship 
between women’s education and their equal participation in the civil, cultural, 
economic, political and social activities of the community and the promotion of the 
right to development;  

 30. Stresses the need for the integration of the rights of children, girls and 
boys alike, in all policies and programmes and for ensuring the promotion and 
protection of those rights, especially in areas relating to health, education and the 
full development of their capacities;  

 31. Welcomes the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS adopted at the high-
level meeting of the General Assembly on 2 June 2006,14 stresses that further and 
additional measures must be taken at the national and international levels to fight 
HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases, taking into account ongoing efforts 
and programmes, and reiterates the need for international assistance in this regard;  

 32. Recalls the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,15

international cooperation in the realization of the right to development;

realization of the right to development, and reaffirms the commitment to promote 
their rights in the areas of education, employment, vocational training and 
retraining, housing, sanitation, health and social security, in accordance with 
recognized international human rights obligations and taking into account, as 
appropriate, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 61/295 of 13 September 2007;

organizations and the private sector in pursuit of poverty eradication and 
development, as well as for corporate social responsibility;  

 35. Emphasizes the urgent need for taking concrete and effective measures to 
prevent, combat and criminalize all forms of corruption at all levels, to prevent, 
detect and deter in a more effective manner international transfers of illicitly 
acquired assets and to strengthen international cooperation in asset recovery, 
consistent with the principles of the United Nations Convention against Corruption,16 
particularly chapter V thereof, stresses the importance of a genuine political 
commitment on the part of all Governments through a firm legal framework, and in 
this context urges States to sign and ratify the Convention as soon as possible and 
States parties to implement it effectively;  

 36. Also emphasizes the need to strengthen further the activities of the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the promotion and

Secretary-General to provide the Office of the High Commissioner with the 
necessary resources;
