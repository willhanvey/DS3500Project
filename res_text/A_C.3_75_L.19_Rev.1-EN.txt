the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 5 and the Convention 

on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocols thereto,6 

 Reaffirming further the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against 

Women,7 the Beijing Declaration8 and Platform for Action,9 the Programme of Action 

of the International Conference on Population and Development 10 and the outcomes 

of their review conferences, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 

Indigenous Peoples,11 

 Welcoming the commitment to achieve gender equality and the empowerment 

of all women and girls contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development12 

and in the agreed conclusions adopted by the Commission on the Status of Women at 

its sixtieth session13 and previous sessions, recognizing that women play a vital role 

as agents of development, and acknowledging that realizing gender equality and the 

empowerment of all women and girls is crucial to making progress across all 

Sustainable Development Goals and targets,  

 Recalling that 2020 marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Fourth World 

Conference on Women and the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for 

Action, which have contributed greatly to the progress made towards achieving 

gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, and in this regard taking 

note with appreciation of the political declaration adopted by the Commission on the 

Status of Women at its sixty-fourth session, on the occasion of the anniversary, 14

efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls in the 

public and private spheres in all regions of the world, and re-emphasizing that violence 

against women and girls violates, and impairs their full enjoyment of, all human rights,  

 Recognizing that women’s poverty and lack of empowerment, as well as their 

marginalization resulting from their exclusion from social and economic policies and 

from the benefits of education and sustainable development, can place them at 

increased risk of violence, and that violence against women and gir ls impedes the 

social and economic and therefore the sustainable development of communities and 

States, as well as the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 

and other internationally agreed development goals,  

 Recognizing also that violence against women and girls, including sexual 

harassment, is rooted in historical and structural inequality in power relations between 

men and women, seriously violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of all 

human rights and fundamental freedoms by women and girls and constitutes a major 

impediment to their full, equal and effective participation in society, as well as 

economic and political life, 

 Recognizing further the special needs of women and girls living in areas affected 

by complex humanitarian emergencies and in areas affected by terrorism, and that 

global health threats, climate change, more frequent and intense natural disasters, 

conflicts, violent extremism as and when conducive to terrorism, and related 

humanitarian crises and the forced displacement of people threaten to reverse much 

of the development progress made in recent decades and have particular negative 

impacts on women and girls that need to be comprehensively assessed and addressed,  

 Recognizing that the growing impact of violence against women and girls, 

including sexual harassment, in digital contexts, especially on social media, its 

impunity and the lack of preventive measures and remedies underline the need for 

action by Member States, in partnership with relevant stakeholders, and that such 

violence may include stalking, death threats and threats of sexual and gender-based 

violence, as well as related trends against women and girls in digital contexts, such 

as trolling, cyberbullying and other forms of cyberharassment, inc luding unwanted 

verbal or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature, with a view to discrediting women 

and girls and/or inciting other violations and abuses against them,  

 Alarmed by the fact that violence against women and girls, including gender-

related killings of women and girls, also known as femicide in certain regions of the 

world, which constitutes an extreme form of violence against women and girls, is 

among the least punished crimes, and recognizing the key role of the criminal justice 

system in preventing and responding to violence against women and girls, including 

in ending impunity for such crimes,  

 Gravely concerned that domestic violence, including intimate partner violence, 

remains the most prevalent and least visible form of violence against wo men of all 

social strata across the world, and emphasizing that such violence is a violation, abuse 

or impairment of the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms and, 

as such, is unacceptable, 

 Stressing the need to fully engage men and boys as strategic partners and allies 

in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and in 

preventing and eliminating all forms of sexual and gender-based violence, including 

domestic violence and sexual harassment,  

 Recognizing the critical contribution of family members in combating violence 

against women and girls, including domestic violence, and that in preventing such 

violence the family can play an important role,  



A/C.3/75/L.19/Rev.1 
 

 

20-15040 4/10 

 

 Deeply concerned by the increased violence against women and girls around the 

world, including domestic violence, as well as harmful practices, such as female 

genital mutilation and child early and forced marriage, including in conflict -affected 

areas, particularly in the context of confinement measures and school clo sures 

adopted in response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, 

 Taking note of the response plans, policies and initiatives implemented by 

Governments and civil society in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent 

violence against women and girls, including sexual and gender-based violence, and 

facilitate reporting thereon, and to ensure that all women and girls can lead lives free 

from violence, coercion, stigma and discrimination, including through the use of digital 

technologies, media, helplines or the mobilization of grocery stores, pharmacies, hotels 

and other service providers to help victims to find safe spaces and seek support,  

 Underscoring that, often, a lack of information and awareness, fear of reprisals, 

persisting impunity, all forms of discrimination, including structural discrimination, 

insufficient recourse for victims of violence against women and girls, gender 

stereotypes and negative social norms, including when leading to shame or stigma, as 

well as negative economic consequences, such as loss of livelihood or reduced 

income, prevent many women and girls, as applicable, from reporting or acting as 

witnesses and from seeking redress and justice for these crimes,  

 Acknowledging the importance of combating trafficking in persons in order to 

prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, and in this regard 

stressing the importance of the full and effective implementation of the Protocol to 

Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, 

supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, 16 

as well as of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons,17 

 Emphasizing that the lack or inadequacy of documentation, research and data 

on violence against women and girls, including disaggregated data, and on its 

prevalence, patterns and drivers, as well as on effective approaches to prevent and 

respond to it impedes efforts to design and implement measures, including, where 

appropriate, policies and legislation, to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence 

against women and girls, 

 Stressing that States have the obligation, at all levels, to promote, protect and 

respect all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women and girls, 

and must exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute and hold to account 

the perpetrators of all forms of violence against women and girls, eliminate impunity 

and provide for effective access to appropriate remedies for  victims and survivors, 

and should ensure the protection of women and girls, including adequate enforcement 

of civil remedies, orders of protection and criminal sanctions, and the provision of 

shelters, psychosocial services, counselling, health-care and other types of support 

services, in order to avoid revictimization, to promote an empowering environment, 

and that to do so contributes to the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental 

freedoms by women and girls subjected to violence,  

 Encouraging the removal of all barriers to women’s access to justice and 

ensuring that they all have access to information about their rights as well as effective 

legal assistance so that they can make informed decisions regarding, inter alia, legal 

proceedings and issues relating to family law, and also ensuring that they have access 

to just and effective remedies for the harm that they have suffered, including formal 

and appropriate informal justice mechanisms, as provided for by national legislation 

and, where necessary, the adoption of national legislation,

A/C.3/75/L.19/Rev.1 

 

5/10 20-15040 

 

 Gravely concerned that impunity for violations and abuses against women 

human rights defenders persists owing to factors such as a lack of reporting, 

documentation, investigation and access to justice, social barriers and constraints with 

regard to addressing sexual and gender-based violence and the stigmatization that 

may result from such violations and abuses,  

 Recognizing the need to promote the full, equal and meaningful participation of 

women and women’s organizations, including victims and survivors of violence, in 

the development, implementation and evaluation of gender-responsive policies, 

regulations and legislation designed to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence 

against women and girls, 

 Deeply concerned that the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic 

on the social and economic situation of women and girls and their access to education 

and essential health services, the increased demand for paid and unpaid care work and 

the reported surge of sexual and gender-based violence, including domestic violence 

and violence in digital contexts, during confinement, are deepening already existing 

inequalities and risk reversing the progress in achieving gender equality and the 

empowerment of women and girls made in recent decades, 

 1. Strongly condemns all forms of violence against all women and girls, 

recognizing that they are an impediment to the achievement of gender equality and the 

empowerment of all women and girls and to the full realization of their human rights;  

 2. Stresses that “violence against women” means any act of gender-based 

violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological or 

economic harm or suffering to women and girls, including threats of such acts, coercion 

or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life, 

including online, and notes the economic and social harm caused by such violence;  

 3. Urges States to strongly condemn all forms of violence against all women 

and girls, and reaffirms that they should not invoke any custom, tradition or religious 

consideration to avoid their obligations with respect to its elimination and should 

pursue, by all appropriate means and without delay, a policy of eliminating all forms 

of violence against women, as set out in the Declaration on the Elimination of 

Violence against Women; 

 4. Calls upon States to address discrimination based on multiple and 

intersecting factors, which places women and girls at greater risk of exploitation, 

violence and abuse, and to take appropriate action to empower and protect them as 

well as achieve their full enjoyment of human rights without discrimination;  

 5. Also calls upon States to ensure that all human rights are respected, protected 

and fulfilled while combating the pandemic and that their responses to the COVID-19 

pandemic are in full compliance with their human rights obligations and commitments; 

 6. Urges States to take effective action to eliminate all forms of violence 

against women and girls and to address structural and underlying causes and risk 

factors, including by: 

 (a) Designing and implementing appropriate domestic policies that are aimed 

at transforming discriminatory social attitudes and social and cultural patterns of 

conduct that condone violence against women and girls with a view to preventing and 

eliminating, in all public and private spheres, discrimination, gender stereotypes, 

negative social norms, attitudes and behaviours, and unequal power relations by 

which women and girls are regarded as subordinate to men and boys and that underlie 

and perpetuate male domination; 

 (b) Designing or strengthening and implementing measures that remove 

remaining barriers to access to justice and enable all women and girls to have equal 



A/C.3/75/L.19/Rev.1 
 

 

20-15040 6/10 

 

access to justice systems, adapted and appropriate to their needs and access to 

effective, timely, appropriate and victim-centred remedies; 

 (c) Ensuring that services and programmes designed to protect women and girls 

from violence are accessible to women and girls with disabilities, in particular those 

living in institutionalized settings, who are the most vulnerable to violence, including by 

ensuring that facilities are accessible and mainstreaming disability in materials and 

training courses addressed to professionals working on violence against women;  

 (d) Designing and implementing legislation and policies to prevent and 

respond to gender-related killing of women and girls, including femicide, and to end 

impunity for such cases; 

 (e) Preventing, combating and eliminating trafficking in women and girls by 

criminalizing all forms of trafficking in persons, as well as by rais ing public 

awareness of the issue of trafficking in persons, particularly women and girls, 

including the factors that make women and girls vulnerable to trafficking, and 

eliminating the demand that fosters all forms of exploitation and forced labour, and 

encouraging, where appropriate, the media to play a role with a view to eliminating 

the exploitation of women and children;  

 (f) Taking measures to empower women by, inter alia, strengthening their 

economic autonomy and ensuring their full and equal participation in society and in 

decision-making processes by adopting and implementing social and economic 

policies that guarantee women full and equal access to quality education and training 

and affordable and adequate public and social services, as well as ful l and equal access 

to financial resources and decent work, and full and equal rights to own and have 

access to and control over land and other property, and guaranteeing women’s and 

girls’ inheritance rights, and taking further appropriate measures to address the 

increasing rate of homelessness of and inadequate housing for women in order to 

reduce their vulnerability to violence;  

 (g) Implementing, in partnership with all relevant stakeholders, effective 

violence prevention and response activities in schools and communities, educating 

children from a young age regarding the importance of treating all people with dignity 

and respect, and designing educational programmes and teaching materials that 

support gender equality, respectful relationships and non-violent behaviour; 

 (h) Engaging men and boys in challenging gender stereotypes and negative 

social norms, attitudes and behaviours that underlie and perpetuate such violence and 

in developing and implementing measures that reinforce non-violent actions, attitudes 

and values, and encouraging men and boys, as agents and beneficiaries of change in 

the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, to 

take an active part and become their strategic partners and allies in efforts to prev ent 

and eliminate all forms of violence and discrimination against women and girls;  

 (i) Developing policies and programmes with the support, where appropriate, 

of international organizations, civil society and non-governmental organizations, 

giving priority to formal, informal and non-formal education programmes, including 

scientifically accurate and age-appropriate comprehensive education that is relevant 

to cultural contexts, that provides adolescent girls and boys and young women and 

men in and out of school, consistent with their evolving capacities, and with 

appropriate direction and guidance from parents and legal guardians, with the best 

interests of the child as their basic concern, information on sexual and reproductive 

health and HIV prevention, gender equality and women’s empowerment, human 

rights, physical, psychological and pubertal development and power in relationships 

between women and men, to enable them to build self-esteem and foster informed 

decision-making, communication and risk-reduction skills and to develop respectful 



 
A/C.3/75/L.19/Rev.1 

 

7/10 20-15040 

 

relationships, in full partnership with young persons, parents, legal guardians, 

caregivers, educators and health-care providers, in order to, inter alia, enable them to 

protect themselves from HIV infection and other risks; 

 (j) Accelerating efforts to develop, review and strengthen inclusive and 

gender-responsive policies, including by allocating adequate resources, to address the 

structural and underlying causes of domestic violence against women and girls, to 

overcome gender stereotypes and negative social norms, to encourage the media to 

examine the impact of gender-role stereotypes, including those perpetuated by 

commercial advertisements, that foster gender-based violence, sexual exploitation 

and inequalities, to promote zero tolerance for such violence and to remove the stigma 

of being a victim and survivor of violence, thus creating an enabling and accessible 

environment where women and girls can easily report incidents of violence and make 

use of the services available, including protection and assistance programmes;  

 (k) Taking and implementing further measures to ensure that all officials, 

including those in leadership positions, responsible for implementing policies and 

programmes aimed at preventing violence against women and girls, protecting and 

assisting victims and investigating and punishing acts of violence receive training on 

gender equality and women’s and girls’ empowerment to raise their awareness of 

gender-specific needs, as well as of the underlying causes and the short- and long-

term impact of violence against women and girls, and training on gender-responsive 

investigation of crimes of violence against women and girls;  

 (l) Removing barriers, including political, legal, cultural, social, economic, 

institutional and religious ones, preventing women’s full, equal and effective 

participation in leadership and political and other decision-making positions, taking 

into account that promoting women to leadership positions may significantly reduce 

the risk of violence against them; 

 (m) Taking effective, evidence-based measures to address institutional and 

structural barriers, and negative gender stereotyping, as well as multiple and 

intersecting forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, in addition 

to conducting awareness-raising and capacity-building, in collaboration with civil 

society and women’s organizations and relevant United Nations entities;  

 (n) Taking measures to improve the safety of girls at and on the way to and from 

school, including by creating a safe and violence-free environment by improving 

infrastructure, such as transportation, providing hygienic, separate and adequate sanitation 

facilities, improved lighting, playgrounds and safe environments and adopting policies to 

prevent, address and prohibit all forms of violence against women and girls, including 

gender-based violence and sexual harassment, through all appropriate measures; 

 7. Also urges States to take effective action to protect victims and survivors 

of all forms of violence, including by: 

 (a) Providing relevant, comprehensive and victim-centred legal protection to 

support and assist victims of violence, including sexual harassment, in a gender-

sensitive manner, including victim and witness protection from repr isals for bringing 

complaints or giving evidence, within the framework of their national legal systems, 

including, as appropriate, legislative or other measures throughout the criminal and 

civil justice system, as appropriate, paying particular attention to women and girls 

facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination;  

 (b) Establishing comprehensive, coordinated, interdisciplinary, accessible and 

sustained multisectoral services, programmes and responses for all victims and 

survivors of all forms of violence, including sexual harassment, that are adequately 

resourced, that are, when possible, in a language that they understand and in which they 

can communicate and that include effective and coordinated action by, as appropriate, 



A/C.3/75/L.19/Rev.1 
 

 

20-15040 8/10 

 

relevant stakeholders, such as the police and the justice sector, as well as providers of 

legal aid services, health services, shelters, medical and psychological assistance, 

counselling services and protection, and, in cases of girl victims, ensuring that such 

services, programmes and responses take into account the best interests of the child;  

 (c) Establishing and/or strengthening law enforcement, health and social 

workers’ and counsellors’ response protocols and procedures to ensure that all 

appropriate actions are coordinated and taken to protect and respond to the needs of 

victims of violence, to identify acts of violence and to prevent their recurrence or 

further acts of violence and physical and psychological harm, ensuring that services 

are responsive to survivors’ needs, including by providing access to female health-

care providers, police officers and counsellors if requested, and ensuring and 

maintaining the privacy of victims and the confidentiality of their reporting;  

 8. Stresses the importance of ensuring that, in armed conflict and post-

conflict situations and in natural disaster situations, the prevention of and response to 

all forms of violence against women and girls, including sexual and gender-based 

violence, are prioritized and effectively addressed, including, as appropriate, through 

the investigation, prosecution and punishment of perpetrators to end impunity, the 

removal of barriers to women’s access to justice, the establishment of complaint and 

reporting mechanisms and the provision of support to victims and survivors; 

 9. Encourages States, in efforts to prevent and eliminate violence against 

women and girls, to work in partnership with the private sector and civil society, 

including women’s and community-based organizations, faith-based organizations, 

feminist groups, women human rights defenders, girls’ and youth-led organizations
