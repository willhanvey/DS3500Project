  Preventing and combating illicit brokering activities 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Noting the threat to international peace and security posed by illicit brokering 

activities circumventing the international arms control and non -proliferation 

framework, 

 Concerned that, if proper measures are not taken, the illicit brokering of arms 

in all its aspects will adversely affect the maintenance of international peace and 

security, and prolong conflicts, and could be an obstacle to sustainable economic 

and social development and result in illicit transfers of conventional arms and the 

acquisition of weapons of mass destruction by non-State actors, 

 Recognizing the need for Member States to prevent and combat illicit 

brokering activities, which covers not only conventional arms but also materials, 

equipment and technology that could contribute to the proliferation of weapons of 

mass destruction and their means of delivery,  

 Reaffirming that efforts to prevent and combat illicit brokering activities 

should not hamper the legitimate arms trade and international cooperation with 

respect to materials, equipment and technology for peaceful purposes,  

 Recalling Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) of 28 April 2004, in 

particular paragraph 3, in which the Council determined that all States shall develop 

and maintain appropriate effective border controls and law enforcement efforts to

detect, deter, prevent and combat, including through international cooperation when 

necessary, illicit trafficking in and brokering of materials related to nuclear, 

chemical or biological weapons and their means of delivery, in accordance with 

their national legal authorities and legislation and consistent with international law, 

and taking note of the comprehensive review of the status of implementation of 

resolution 1540 (2004) conducted in 2016, 

 Recalling also General Assembly resolution 69/62 of 2 December 2014, 

 Noting international efforts to prevent and combat illicit arms brokering, in 

particular in small arms and light weapons, as demonstrated by the adoption in 2001 

of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in 

Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects,
1
 and the entry into force in 2005 

of the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, 

Their Parts and Components and Ammunition, supplementing the United Nations 

Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,
2
  

 Recognizing the importance of States parties to the Arms Trade Treaty
3
 taking 

measures, pursuant to their national laws, to regulate brokering taking place under 

their jurisdiction, in accordance with article 10 of the Treaty,  

 Taking note of Security Council resolutions 2117 (2013) of 26 September 2013 

and 2220 (2015) of 22 May 2015 on small arms and light weapons, in which the 

Council encouraged cooperation and information-sharing on suspect brokering 

activities to address the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of 

small arms and light weapons, 

 Taking note also of the report issued on 30 August 2007 by the Group of 

Governmental Experts established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/81 of 

8 December 2005 to consider further steps to enhance international cooperation in 

preventing, combating and eradicating illicit brokering in small arms and light 

weapons
4
 as an international initiative within the framework of the United Nations,  

 Welcoming efforts to implement the Programme of Action and the 

International Instrument to Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely and 

Reliable Manner, Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons,
5
 including the holding of 

the second Open-ended Meeting of Governmental Experts on the Implementation of
