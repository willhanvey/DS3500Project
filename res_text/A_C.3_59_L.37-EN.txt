The right to development

The General Assembly,

Guided by the Charter of the United Nations, which expresses, in particular,
the determination to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger
freedom, as well as to employ international mechanisms for the promotion of the
economic and social advancement of all peoples,

Recalling that the Declaration on the Right to Development, adopted by the
General Assembly in its resolution 41/128 of 4 December 1986, confirmed that the
right to development is an inalienable human right and that equality of opportunity
for development is a prerogative both of nations and of individuals who make up
nations, and the individual as the central subject and beneficiary of development,

Stressing that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action1 reaffirmed
the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of
fundamental human rights, and the individual as the central subject and beneficiary
of development,

Reaffirming the objective of making the right to development a reality for
everyone, as set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, adopted by the
General Assembly on 8 September 2000,2

Welcoming the consensus achieved at the General Council meeting of the
World Trade Organization, held at Geneva from 27 to 31 July 2004,

Welcoming also the outcome of the eleventh session of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development held at São Paulo, Brazil, from 13 to 18 June
2004, on the theme of “Enhancing the coherence between national development
strategies and global economic processes towards economic growth and
development, particularly of developing countries”,

Recalling all its previous resolutions and those of the Commission on Human
Rights on the right to development, in particular Commission resolution 1998/72 of
22 April 1998,3 on the urgent need to make further progress towards the realization
of the right to development as set out in the Declaration on the Right to

Countries, held at Durban, South Africa, from 17 to 19 August 2004,

Reiterating its continuing support for the New Partnership for Africa’s
Development4 as a development framework for Africa,

Recognizing that historical injustices have undeniably contributed to the
poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion, economic disparity,
instability and insecurity that affect many people in different parts of the world, in
particular in developing countries,

Stressing that poverty eradication is one of the critical elements in the
promotion and realization of the right to development and that poverty is a
multifaceted problem that requires a multifaceted and integrated approach in
addressing economic, political, social, environmental and institutional dimensions at
all levels, especially in the context of the millennium development goal of halving,
by 2015, the proportion of the world’s people whose income is less than one dollar a
day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger,

progress made in the fulfilment of all the commitments contained in the United
Nations Millennium Declaration,2 including the internationally agreed development
goals and the global partnership required for their achievement;

4. Stresses the importance of the core principles contained in the
conclusions of the third session of the Working Group,6 congruent with the purpose
of international human rights instruments, such as equality, non-discrimination,
accountability, participation and international cooperation, as critical to
mainstreaming the right to development at the international level, and underlines the
importance of the principles of equity and transparency;

5. Notes with concern that the Subcommission on the Promotion and
Protection of Human Rights at its fifty-sixth session did not consider the working
paper identifying and analysing possible alternatives, and requests the
Subcommission to submit to the Commission without further delay the concept
document establishing options for the implementation of the right to development
and their feasibility for the Commission to consider and take decisions on this
matter at its sixty-second session;

6. Welcomes the convening and outcome of the Social Forum held at
Geneva on 22 and 23 July 2004 on the theme of “Poverty, rural poverty and human

including Member States, to participate actively in its subsequent sessions;

7. Reaffirms the commitment to implement the goals and targets set out in
all the outcome documents of the major United Nations conferences and summits
and their review processes, in particular those relating to the realization of the right
to development, recognizing that the realization of the right to development is
critical to achieving the objectives, goals and targets set in those outcome
documents;

8. Reaffirms also that the realization of the right to development is essential
to the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action,1 which
regards all human rights as universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated,
places the human person at the centre of development and recognizes that, while
development facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights, the lack of development
may not be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally recognized human
rights;

9. Stresses that the basic responsibility for the promotion and protection of
all human rights lies with the State, and reaffirms that States have the primary
responsibility for their own economic and social development and that the role of
national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized;

10. Reaffirms that States have the primary responsibility for the creation of
national and international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to
development and their commitment to cooperating with each other to that end;

conducive to the realization of the right to development;

realization of the right to development at the international and national levels, and

right to development as a fundamental human right;

13. Emphasizes the critical importance of identifying and analysing obstacles
impeding the full realization of the right to development at both the national and the
international levels;

14. Affirms that, while globalization offers both opportunities and challenges,
the process of globalization remains deficient in achieving the objectives of
integrating all countries into a globalized world, and stresses the need for policies
and measures at the national and global levels to respond to the challenges and
opportunities of globalization if this process is to be made fully inclusive and
equitable;

15. Recognizes that, despite continuous efforts on the part of the
international community, the gap between developed and developing countries
remains unacceptably wide, that developing countries continue to face difficulties in
participating in the globalization process and that many risk being marginalized and
effectively excluded from its benefits;

16. Underlines the fact that the international community is far from meeting
the target set in the United Nations Millennium Declaration6 of halving the number
of people living in poverty by 2015, and emphasizes the principle of international
cooperation, including partnership and commitment, between developed and
developing countries towards achieving the goal;

17. Reaffirms the commitment, and urges developed countries that have not
yet done so, to make concrete efforts towards meeting the targets of 0.7 per cent of
their gross national product for official development assistance to developing
countries and 0.15 to 0.2 per cent of their gross national product to least developed
countries, and encourages developing countries to build on the progress achieved in
ensuring that official development assistance is used effectively to help to meet
development goals and targets;

18. Welcomes the consensus achieved on the key areas of agriculture, market
access for non-agricultural products, trade facilitation, development and services;

19. Calls for the implementation of a desirable pace of meaningful trade
liberalization, including in areas under negotiation; implementation of commitments
on implementation-related issues and concerns; review of special and differential-
treatment provisions, with a view to strengthening them and making them more
precise, effective and operational; avoidance of new forms of protectionism; and
capacity-building and technical assistance for developing countries as important
issues in making progress towards the effective implementation of the right to
development;

20. Recognizes the important link between the international economic,
commercial and financial spheres and the realization of the right to development,
stresses, in this regard, the need for good governance and broadening the base of
decision-making at the international level on issues of development concern and to
fill organizational gaps, as well as strengthen the United Nations system and other
multilateral institutions, and also stresses the need to broaden and strengthen the

A/C.3/59/L.37

participation of developing countries and economies in transition in international
economic decision-making and norm-setting;

21. Recognizes also that good governance and the rule of law at the national
level assist all States in the promotion and protection of human rights, including the
right to development, and agrees on the value of the ongoing efforts being made by
States to identify and strengthen good governance practices, including transparent,
responsible, accountable and participatory government, that are responsive and
appropriate to their needs and aspirations, including in the context of agreed
partnership approaches to development, capacity-building and technical assistance;

22. Recognizes further the important role and the rights of women and the
application of a gender perspective as a cross-cutting issue in the process of
realizing the right to development, and notes in particular the positive relationship
between women’s education and their equal participation in the civil, cultural,
economic, political and social activities of the community and the promotion of the
right to development;

23. Stresses the need for the integration of the rights of children, girls and
boys alike, in all policies and programmes, and for ensuring the protection and
promotion of those rights, especially in areas relating to health, education and the
full development of their capacities;

24. Stresses also that further and additional measures must be taken at the
national and international levels to fight HIV/AIDS and other communicable
diseases, taking into account ongoing efforts and programmes, and reiterates the
need for international assistance in this regard;

25. Recognizes the need for strong partnerships with civil society
organizations and the private sector in pursuit of poverty eradication and
development, as well as for good corporate governance;

26. Emphasizes the urgent need for taking concrete measures to fight against
all forms of corruption at the national and international levels, to prevent, detect and
deter in a more effective manner international transfers of illicitly acquired assets
and to strengthen international cooperation in asset recovery, stresses the importance
of a genuine political commitment on the part of all Governments through a firm
legal framework, and in this context urges States to sign and ratify the United
Nations Convention against Corruption7 as soon as possible;

27. Emphasizes the need to strengthen further the activities of the Office of
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the promotion and
realization of the right to development, including ensuring effective use of the
financial and human resources necessary to fulfil its mandate and better servicing of
and support for the Working Group on the Right to Development;

28. Reaffirms the request to the High Commissioner, in mainstreaming the
right to development, to undertake effectively activities aimed at strengthening the
global partnership for development between Member States, development agencies
and the international development, financial and trade institutions, and to reflect
these activities in detail in her report to the Commission on Human Rights at its
sixty-first session;

29. Calls upon the United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, as well

their policies and objectives;

attention of Member States, United Nations organs and bodies, specialized agencies,
