 Recalling the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, 

 Recalling its relevant resolutions, including the resolutions of its tenth

 Recalling the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International

 Reaffirming its resolution ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004 entitled “Advisory opinion 
of the International Court of Justice on the Legal Consequences of the Construction 
of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East 
Jerusalem”, 

 Recalling the request made in resolution ES-10/15 for the Secretary-General to 
establish a register of damage caused to all natural or legal persons concerned in 
connection with paragraphs 152 and 153 of the advisory opinion, 

 Noting in this connection the Court’s conclusion whereby, inter alia: 

Israel is accordingly under an obligation to return the land, orchards, olive 
groves and other immovable property seized from any natural or legal person 
for purposes of construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. 
In the event that such restitution should prove to be materially impossible, 
Israel has an obligation to compensate the persons in question for the damage 
suffered. The Court considers that Israel also has an obligation to compensate, 
in accordance with the applicable rules of international law, all natural or legal 
persons having suffered any form of material damage as a result of the wall’s 
construction,3 

 Deploring the continuing construction, contrary to international law, by Israel, 
the occupying Power, of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in 
and around East Jerusalem, against the conclusions of the International Court of 
Justice in its advisory opinion of 9 July 2004 and of resolution ES-10/15 and in 
breach of the applicable rules and principles of international law, 

 Recognizing the necessity of accurately documenting the damage caused by 
the construction of the wall for the purpose of fulfilling the obligation to make the 
above-mentioned reparations, including restitution and compensation, in accordance 
with the rules and principles of international law, and noting that the act of 
registration of damage, as such, does not entail, at this stage, an evaluation or 
assessment of the loss or damage caused by the construction of the wall, 

 Taking note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General of 
17 October 2006 pursuant to General Assembly resolution ES-10/15,4 

 1. Reaffirms its resolution ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004 entitled “Advisory 
opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legal Consequences of the 
Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and 
around East Jerusalem”, and reiterates the demands made therein, including, inter 
alia, the demand that Israel, the occupying Power, comply with its legal obligations 
as mentioned in the advisory opinion; 

 2. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General 
pursuant to General Assembly resolution ES-10/15;4 

 3. Establishes the United Nations Register of Damage caused by the 
Construction of the Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory:
