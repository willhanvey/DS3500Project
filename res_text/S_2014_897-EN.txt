 The Security Council,  

 Recalling its resolutions 2042 (2012), 2043 (2012), 2118 (2013), 2139 (2014), 

2165 (2014) and 2175 (2014), and its Presidential Statements of 3 August 2011 

(S/PRST/2011/16), 21 March 2012 (S/PRST/2012/6), 5 April 2012 (S/PRST/2012/10) 

and 2 October 2013 (S/PRST/2013/15),  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 

territorial integrity of Syria, and to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the 

United Nations,  

 Expressing outrage at the unacceptable and escalating level of violence and 

the killing of more than 191,000 people, including well over 10,000 children, as a 

result of the Syrian conflict, as reported by the Secretary-General of the United 

Nations and his Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict,  

 Gravely distressed by the continued deterioration of the devastating 

humanitarian situation in Syria and by the fact that now more than 12.2 million 

people in Syria — of whom 7.6 million are internally displaced, 4.5 million are 

living in hard-to-reach areas and 212,000 are trapped in besieged areas, including 

Palestinian refugees — require urgent humanitarian assistance, including medical 

assistance, and noting with concern that approximately one million more people 

have been displaced within Syria since the adoption of resolution 2165 (2014),  

 Gravely concerned at the lack of effective implementation of its resolutions 

2139 (2014) and 2165 (2014) by the parties to the Syrian domestic conflict, 

recalling in this regard their legal obligations under international humanitarian law 

and international human rights law, as well as all the relevant decisions of the 

Security Council, including by ceasing all attacks against civilians and civilian 

objects, including those involving attacks on schools, medical facilities and the 

deliberate interruptions of water supply, the indiscriminate use of weapo ns, 

including artillery, barrel bombs and air strikes, indiscriminate shelling by mortars, 

car bombs, suicide attacks and tunnel bombs, as well as the use of starvation of 

civilians as a method of combat, including by the besiegement of populated areas, 

and the widespread use of torture, ill-treatment, arbitrary executions, extrajudicial 

killings, enforced disappearances, sexual and gender-based violence as well as all 

grave violations and abuses committed against children,

S/2014/897 
 

 

14-67429 2/4 

 

 Expressing its grave concern that areas of Syria are under the control of the 

Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Al Nusrah Front (ANF) and about 

the negative impact of their presence, violent extremist ideology and actions on 

stability in Syria and the region, including the devastating humanitarian impact on 

the civilian populations which has led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands 

of people, reaffirming its resolve to address all aspects of the threat posed by ISIL, 

ANF and all other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with 

Al-Qaida, and calling for the implementation of Security Council resolutions 2170 

(2014) and 2178 (2014), and its Presidential Statement of 28 July 2014 

(S/PRST/2014/14),  

 Strongly condemning the arbitrary detention and torture of civilians in Syria, 

notably in prisons and detention facilities, as well as the kidnappings, abductions, 

hostage taking and forced disappearances, and demanding the immediate end of 

these practices and the release of all arbitrarily detained persons starting with 

women and children, as well as sick, wounded and elderly people including United 

Nations and humanitarian personnel and journalists,  

 Recalling its strong condemnation in resolution 2175 (2014) of all forms of 

violence and intimidation to which those participating in humanitarian operations 

are increasingly exposed, as well as attacks on humanitarian convoys and acts of 

destruction and looting of their assets, and its urging of all parties involved in an 

armed conflict to promote the safety, security and freedom of movement of 

humanitarian personnel and United Nations and its associated personnel and their 

assets, and urging that all parties to the Syrian domestic conflict must take all 

appropriate steps to ensure the safety and security of United Nations and associated 

personnel, those of its specialized agencies, and all other personnel engaged in 

humanitarian relief activities, 

 Noting that, despite all the challenges, the United Nations and their 

implementing partners continue to deliver life-saving assistance to millions of 

people in need, and taking note that hard-to-reach locations in Aleppo, Idleb, 

Quneitra and Dar’a have been reached since the adoption of resolution 2165 (2014) 

through humanitarian aid delivered across borders, stressing however in this regard 

that most people in hard-to-reach and besieged areas remain difficult for the United 

Nations and their implementing partners to reach with humanitarian assistance,  

 Expressing deep concern at the continuing and new impediments to the 

delivery of humanitarian assistance across borders and across conflict lines, 

encouraging the United Nations humanitarian agencies and their implementing 

partners to take steps to scale up humanitarian deliveries into hard-to-reach and 

besieged areas, including by using, as effectively as possible, border crossings under 

resolution 2165 (2014), and noting that the United Nations monitoring mechanism is 

operational and continuing its activities, including monitoring shipments and 

confirming their humanitarian nature, in accordance with resolution 2165 (2014),  

 Reaffirming the need to support the United Nations humanitarian agencies and 

their implementing partners in their efforts to expand the delivery of humanitarian 

assistance to reach all people in need in Syria, and further reaffirming its decision in 

resolution 2165 (2014) that all Syrian parties to the conflict shall enable the 

immediate and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance directly to people 

throughout Syria, by the United Nations humanitarian agencies and their 

implementing partners, on the basis of United Nations assessments of need and

devoid of any political prejudices and aims, including by immediately removing all 

impediments to the provision of humanitarian assistance, 

 Noting the role that ceasefire agreements which are consistent with 

humanitarian principles and international humanitarian law can play in facilitating 

the delivery of humanitarian assistance in order to help save civilian lives, 

 Recalling the need for all parties to respect the relevant provisions of 

international humanitarian law and the United Nations guiding principles of 

humanitarian emergency assistance, 

 Expressing grave concern at the more than 3.2 million refugees, including 

more than 2.5 million women and children, who have fled Syria as a result of 

ongoing violence, and recognizing that the continued deterioration of the 

humanitarian situation in Syria is further contributing to the movement of refugees  

and poses risks to regional stability,  

 Reiterating its deep appreciation for the significant and admirable efforts that 

have been made by the countries of the region, notably Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, 

Iraq and Egypt, to accommodate Syrian refugees, including the approximately 

400,000 refugees who have fled Syria since the adoption of resolution 2165 (2014), 

and mindful of the immense costs and social challenges incurred by these countries 

as a consequence of the crisis,  

 Noting with concern that the international response to the Syrian and regional 

crisis continues to fall short of meeting the needs as assessed by host governments 

and the United Nations, therefore urging once again all Member States, based on 

burden-sharing principles, to support the United Nations and the countries of the 

region, including by adopting medium and long-term responses to alleviate the 

impact on communities, providing increased, flexible and predictable funding as 

well as increasing resettlement efforts, and taking note in this regard of the Berlin 

Communiqué of 28 October 2014, 

 Noting with grave concern that impunity in Syria contributes to widespread 

violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian 

law, stressing the need to end impunity for these violations and abuses, and 

re-emphasizing in this regard the need that those who have committed or are 

otherwise responsible for such violations and abuses in Syria must be brought to 

justice,  

 Emphasizing that the humanitarian situation will continue to deteriorate further 

in the absence of a political solution to the crisis,  

 Determining that the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Syria continues to 

constitute a threat to peace and security in the region,  

 Underscoring that Member States are obligated under Article 25 of the Charter 

of the United Nations to accept and carry out the Council’s decisions,  

 1. Demands that all parties to the Syrian domestic conflict, in particular the 

Syrian authorities, immediately comply with their obligations under international 

humanitarian law and international human rights law, and fully and immediately 

implement all the provisions of Security Council resolutions 2139 (2014) and 2165 

(2014) and the Presidential Statement of 2 October 2013 (S/PRST/2013/15), and

S/2014/897 
 

 

14-67429 4/4 

 

recalls that some of the violations and abuses committed in Syria may amount to 

war crimes and crimes against humanity;  

 2. Decides to renew the decisions in paragraphs two and three of Security 

Council resolution 2165 (2014) for a period of twelve months, that is, until 

10 January 2016;  

 3. Decides to conduct six months after the renewal of these decisions a 

review of the implementation of paragraph two of this resolution;  

 4. Expresses its full support for the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General 

for Syria, Mr. Staffan de Mistura, looks forward in particular to further advice from 

the Special Envoy concerning his proposals aimed at reducing violence, including 

through the implementation of freeze zones, emphasizes that if the violence in Syria 

continues to escalate, the humanitarian situation will continue to worsen, and 

reiterates that the only sustainable solution to the current crisis in Syria is through 

an inclusive and Syrian-led political process that meets the legitimate aspirations of 

the Syrian people, with a view to full implementation of the Geneva Communiqué 

of 30 June 2012 endorsed as annex II of its resolution 2118 (2013);  

 5. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Council on the 

implementation of this resolution, and on compliance by all parties to the Syrian 

domestic conflict, within the framework of its reporting on resolutions 2139 (2014) 

and 2165 (2014);  

 6. Reaffirms that it will take further measures under the Charter of the 

United Nations in the event of non-compliance with this resolution or resolution 

2139 (2014) or 2165 (2014) by any party to the Syrian domestic conflict;  

 7. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
