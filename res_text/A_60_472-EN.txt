Recalling also the report of the United Nations mission dispatched in August
2002 to Tokelau at the invitation of the Government of New Zealand and the
representatives of Tokelau,2

Noting that, as a small island Territory, Tokelau exemplifies the situation of
most remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories and that, as a case study pointing to
successful cooperation for decolonization, Tokelau has wider significance for the
United Nations as it seeks to complete its work in decolonization,

document entitled “Joint statement of the principles of partnership”, which sets out
in writing, for the first time, the rights and obligations of the two partner countries,

8. Further acknowledges Tokelau’s need for continued reassurance, given
the cultural adjustments that are taking place with the strengthening of its capacity
for self-government and, since local resources cannot adequately cover the material
side of self-determination, the ongoing responsibility of Tokelau’s external partners
to assist Tokelau in balancing its desire to be self-reliant to the greatest extent
possible with its need for external assistance;

9. Welcomes the establishment of the Tokelau International Trust Fund to
support the future development needs of Tokelau and the facilitation of this process
through a donor round table to be convened by the United Nations Development
Programme following an act of self-determination by Tokelau, and calls upon

Having examined the relevant chapter of the report of the Special Committee
on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the
Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples,1

Recalling all resolutions and decisions of the United Nations relating to those
Territories, including, in particular, the resolutions adopted by the General
Assembly at its fifty-ninth session on the individual Territories covered by the
present resolution,

Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territories
are valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the
peoples concerned and in conformity with the clearly defined principles contained
in resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of 15 December 1960

Conscious of the importance of continuing effective implementation of the
Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate
colonialism by 2010 and the plan of action for the Second International Decade for
the Eradication of Colonialism,2

administration,3

Taking note also of the stated position of the Government of the United States
of America on the Non-Self-Governing Territories under its administration,4

of the participation of elected and appointed representatives of the Territories in the
work of the Special Committee,

Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories
should continue to guide the development of their future political status and that
referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an
important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,

Convinced also that any negotiations to determine the status of a Territory
must take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of that
Territory, under the supervision of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and
that the views of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories in respect of
their right to self-determination should be ascertained,

United Nations visiting mission for a long time and that no visiting missions have
been sent to some of the Territories, and considering the possibility of sending
further visiting missions to the Territories at an appropriate time and in consultation
with the administering Powers,

Mindful also that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its
understanding of the political status of the peoples of the Territories and to fulfil its
mandate effectively, it is important for it to be apprised by the administering Powers
and to receive information from other appropriate sources, including the
representatives of the Territories, concerning the wishes and aspirations of the
peoples of the Territories,

understanding of the options of self-determination,

Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters and other venues, with the active
participation of representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a
helpful means for the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate, and that the regional
nature of the seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a
crucial element in their success, while recognizing the need for reviewing the role of
those seminars in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the
political status of the Territories,

Mindful also that, by holding a Caribbean regional seminar in Canouan, Saint
Vincent and the Grenadines, from 17 to 19 May 2005, the Special Committee was
