The right of the Palestinian people to self-determination

The General Assembly,

Aware that the development of friendly relations among nations, based on

Recalling in this regard its resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970, entitled
“Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and
Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations”,

Bearing in mind the International Covenants on Human Rights,2 the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights,3 the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to
Colonial Countries and Peoples4 and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of
Action adopted at the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993,5

A/C.3/59/L.70

Recalling also the United Nations Millennium Declaration,7

Taking into account the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice
on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied
Palestinian Territory, issued on 9 July 2004, and noting in particular the
determination of the Court that the “right of peoples to self-determination is today a
right erga omnes”,

Concerned by the fact that, as concluded by the Court in its Advisory Opinion,
the construction of the wall by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, along with measures previously
taken, severely impedes the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination,

Expressing the urgent need for the resumption of negotiations within the
Middle East peace process on its agreed basis and for the speedy achievement of a
final settlement between the Palestinian and Israeli sides,

Recalling its resolution 58/292 of 6 May 2004,

Affirming the right of all States in the region to live in peace within secure and
internationally recognized borders,

1. Reaffirms the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination,
including the right to their independent State of Palestine;

2. Urges all States and the specialized agencies and organizations of the
United Nations system to continue to support and assist the Palestinian people in the
early realization of their right to self-determination.
