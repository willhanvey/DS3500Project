caused by anti-personnel mines, which kill or maim hundreds of people every week,

coordinated manner to facing the challenge of removing anti-personnel mines placed 
throughout the world and to assure their destruction, 

 Wishing to do the utmost in ensuring assistance for the care and rehabilitation, 
including the social and economic reintegration, of mine victims, 

 Recalling that 2007 marks the tenth anniversary of the adoption and opening 
for signature of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, 
Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction,1 and
