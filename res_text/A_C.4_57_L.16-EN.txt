Work of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices
Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other
Arabs of the Occupied Territories

The General Assembly,

Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,

Guided also by international humanitarian law, in particular the Fourth Geneva
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12
August 1949, as well as international standards of human rights, in particular the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on Human
Rights,

Recalling its relevant resolutions, including resolutions 2443 (XXIII) of 19
December 1968 and 56/59 of 10 December 2001, as well as relevant resolutions of
the Commission on Human Rights,

Recalling also relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

Convinced that occupation itself represents a gross and grave violation of
human rights,

Gravely concerned about the continuation of the tragic events that have taken
place since 28 September 2000, including the excessive use of force by the Israeli
occupying forces against Palestinian civilians, resulting in thousands of deaths and
injuries,

Having considered the reports of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli
Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of
the Occupied Territories and the relevant reports of the Secretary-General,

Recalling the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government
Arrangements of 13 September 1993 and the subsequent implementation agreements
signed between the Palestinian and Israeli sides,

Expressing the hope that the Israeli occupation will be brought to an early end
and that therefore the violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people will
cease,

1. Commends the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices
Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the
Occupied Territories for its efforts in performing the tasks assigned to it by the
General Assembly and for its impartiality;

2. Reiterates its demand that Israel, the occupying Power, cooperate with
the Special Committee in implementing its mandate;

3. Deplores those policies and practices of Israel which violate the human
rights of the Palestinian people and other Arabs of the occupied territories, as
reflected in the reports of the Special Committee covering the reporting period;

4. Expresses grave concern about the situation in the Occupied Palestinian
Territory, including East Jerusalem, as a result of Israeli practices and measures, and
especially condemns the excessive and indiscriminate use of force since 28
September 2000, which has resulted in almost two thousand Palestinian deaths and
tens of thousands of injuries;

5. Requests the Special Committee, pending complete termination of the
Israeli occupation, to continue to investigate Israeli policies and practices in the
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including Jerusalem, and other Arab territories
occupied by Israel since 1967, especially Israeli violations of the Geneva
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12
August 1949, and to consult, as appropriate, with the International Committee of the
Red Cross according to its regulations in order to ensure that the welfare and human
rights of the peoples of the occupied territories are safeguarded and to report to the
Secretary-General as soon as possible and whenever the need arises thereafter;

6. Also requests the Special Committee to submit regularly to the Secretary-
General periodic reports on the current situation in the Occupied Palestinian
Territory, including Jerusalem;

7. Further requests the Special Committee to continue to investigate the
treatment of prisoners and detainees in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including
Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967;

8. Requests the Secretary-General:

(a) To provide the Special Committee with all necessary facilities, including
those required for its visits to the occupied territories, so that it may investigate
Israeli policies and practices referred to in the present resolution;

(b) To continue to make available such additional staff as may be necessary
to assist the Special Committee in the performance of its tasks;



3

A/C.4/57/L.16

(c) To circulate regularly to Member States the periodic reports mentioned in
paragraph 6 above;

(d) To ensure the widest circulation of the reports of the Special Committee
and of information regarding its activities and findings, by all means available,
through the Department of Public Information of the Secretariat and, where
necessary, to reprint those reports of the Special Committee that are no longer
available;

(e) To report to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session on the tasks
entrusted to him in the present resolution;

9. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-eighth session the
