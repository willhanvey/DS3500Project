our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, in which it adopted a 

comprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative 

Sustainable Development Goals and targets, its commitment to working tirelessly for 

the full implementation of the Agenda by 2030, its recognition that eradicating 

poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest 

global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, its 

commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions – 

economic, social and environmental – in a balanced and integrated manner, and to 

building upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seeking 

to address their unfinished business,  

 Reaffirming also its resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015 on the Addis Ababa

to its discussions and its decisions on global matters of concern to the international 

community, 

 Recognizing that, notwithstanding the opportunities and strong momentum to 

world economic growth brought by globalization, major challenges still remain to be 

addressed through multilateralism, and emphasizing the need to guide the direction 

of globalization and make it more invigorated, inclusive and sustainable,  

 Recommitting to setting out together on the path towards sustainable 

development, remaining devoted to the pursuit of global development and “win-win” 

cooperation, which can bring huge gains to all countries and all parts of the world, 

and reaffirming that every State has, and shall freely exercise, full permanent 

sovereignty over all its wealth, natural resources and economic activity,  

 Recognizing that globalization and interdependence imply that the economic 

performance of a country is increasingly affected by factors outside its geographical 

borders, that maximizing the benefits of globalization in an equitable manner requires 

coherent responses at the global, regional and national levels and that there remains 

a need for a revitalized global partnership for sustainable development to achieve the 

Sustainable Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals,  

 Emphasizing that globalization is a useful tool for development that should 

benefit all countries and peoples and that every effort should be made by all to 

meaningfully integrate all countries into the global economy by creating an enabling 

international environment that is inclusive and mutually beneficial for their goods and 

services, 

 Reaffirming its strong support for fair and inclusive globalization and the need 

to translate sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth into sustainable 

development, particularly poverty eradication and reduction of inequality, and, in this 

regard, its resolve to make the goals of full and productive employment and decent 

work for all, including women and young people, persons with disabilities, 

indigenous peoples, local communities and other people in vulnerable situations, a 

central objective of relevant national and international policies and national 

development strategies, including strategies to eradicate poverty in all its forms and 

dimensions, as part of efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,  

 Reaffirming that evidence shows that gender equality, women’s empowerment 

and women’s full and equal participation and leadership in the economy are vital to 

achieve sustainable development and significantly enhance economic growth and 

productivity, that women play a critical role in development and contribute to 

structural transformation and that their full and equal participation in decision-making 

and the economy is vital in order to achieve sustainable development, and reaffirming 

also that gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls will make a 

crucial contribution to progress in realizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

Development, 

 Reaffirming also that the spread of information and communications technology 

and global interconnectedness has great potential to accelerate human progress, to 

bridge the digital divide and to develop knowledge societies, as does scientific and 

technological innovation across areas as diverse as medicine and energy,  

 Reaffirming further the commitment to eradicate poverty and hunger in all its 

forms and dimensions and promote sustained, inclusive and equitable growth, 

sustainable development and global prosperity for all and to promote the development 

of the productive sectors in developing countries to enable them to participate more 

meaningfully and effectively in and benefit from the process of globalization, 



A/74/382/Add.1 
 

 

19-20956 6/8 

 

 Recognizing that the international multilateral system should continue to 

support sustainable development in all countries, particularly in relation to sustained, 

inclusive and sustainable economic growth, job creation and the efforts of developing 

countries to eradicate poverty and hunger and achieve environmental sustainability, 

and should continue to promote good governance and the rule of law at all levels,  

 Cognizant that the future prospects of entire economies and societies will 

depend on how effectively all stakeholders respond to the technological trends and 

challenges and to the interplay of those trends with other major trends, such as 

urbanization, the changing nature of work, demographic shifts, climate change, the 

increasing magnitude of disasters and environmental challenges and increasing 

inequality within countries, 

 Noting with concern that current trade tensions and a surge in trade-restrictive 

measures are greatly increasing economic uncertainty, and underscoring  that 

prioritizing and strengthening global cooperation, including through multilateral 

solutions, are in the interest of all and remain crucial elements in fulfilling the promise 

of globalization, 

 Expressing concern about the adverse impact of the continuing fragility of the 

global economy and the slow pace of restoration of global growth and trade, including 

on development, cognizant that the global economy remains in a challenging phase, 

with many downside risks, including net negative capital flows from some emerging 

and developing economies, continued low commodity prices, high unemployment, 

particularly among young people, women, persons with disabilities, indigenous 

peoples, local communities and people in vulnerable situations, and rising private and 

public indebtedness in many developing countries, and stressing the need for 

continuing efforts to address systemic fragilities and imbalances and to reform and 

strengthen the international financial system while implementing the reforms agreed 

upon to date in order to attend to those challenges and make progress towards 

sustaining global demand, 

 Reiterating the pledge that no one will be left behind, reaffirming the 

recognition that the dignity of the human person is fundamental, and the wish to see 

the Goals and targets met for all nations and peoples and for all segments of society, 

and recommitting to endeavour to reach the furthest behind first,  

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General entitled “Fulfilling the 

promise of globalization: advancing sustainable development in an interconnected 

world”;3 

 2. Reiterates the need for inclusive, transparent and effective multilateral 

approaches to managing global challenges, and in this regard reaffirms the central 

role of the United Nations system in ongoing efforts to find common solutions to such 

challenges; 

 3. Recognizes that a reinvigorated multilateral system, with the United 

Nations at its centre, is the cornerstone of a renewed approach to fairer and more 

inclusive and sustainable globalization to ensure that the negative consequences of 

globalization do not threaten peoples’ livelihoods and the sustainability of the planet;  

 4. Welcomes the ongoing efforts of the Secretary-General to reposition the 

United Nations development system to better support countries with their 

implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 4 and calls upon all

stakeholders to implement the remaining tasks swiftly and coherently throughout the 

United Nations development system;  

 5. Reaffirms the need for the United Nations to play a fundamental role in 

the promotion of international cooperation for development and the coherence, 

coordination and implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and actions 

agreed upon by the international community, and reiterates its commitment to 

strengthening coordination within the United Nations in close cooperation with all 

other multilateral financial, trade and development institutions in order to support 

sustainable development in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

Development; 

 6. Notes the important efforts undertaken nationally, regionally and 

internationally to respond to the challenges posed by the financial and economic crisis 

and persisting risks to the global economy, and recognizes that more needs to be done 

in order to promote economic recovery and to address, among others, turbulence in 

global financial and commodity markets, policy uncertainty, trade tensions, financial 

volatility, unsustainable debt and high unemployment in several countries;  

 7. Encourages Member States to advance economic reforms proactively, as 

appropriate, innovate the growth model and focus on the inclusiveness of 

development and, in the meantime, strengthen international cooperation and avoid 

inward-looking policies and protectionism, so as to promote an open world economy 

and generate greater positive effects of globalization;  

 8. Recognizes the critical role of trade and development and interrelated 

issues in the areas of finance, technology and investment for inclusive and sustainable 

development and the need to provide integrated policy responses to issues arising in 

these areas, including to address inequalities within and among countries, and also 

recognizes the importance of international cooperation, finance, technology and 

capacity-building to supporting national efforts, in line with national priorities and 

respecting each country’s policy space while remaining consistent with international 

rules and commitments; 

 9. Also recognizes the need for the multilateral trade, economic and financial 

architecture to incorporate and promote sustainable development and ensure greater 

coherence and coordination to promote an enabling international environment that 

facilitates the work of Member States in addressing, inter alia, poverty, inequalities 

and environmental challenges; 

 10. Underlines that the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals 

and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will depend on an enabling 

international environment for development and on facilitating the necessary means of 

implementation, particularly in the areas of finance, international trade, technology 

and capacity-building for developing countries, and in this regard calls for a sincere 

and effective follow-up on the global commitments of all actors;  

 11. Recognizes that the scaling up of successful policies and approaches in the 

implementation and achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals needs to be 

complemented by an enhanced and revitalized global partnership and that this 

partnership should work in the spirit of global solidarity to support a truly universal 

and transformative global development agenda;  

 12. Reaffirms that the creation, development and diffusion of new innovations 

and technologies and associated know-how, including the transfer of technology on 

mutually agreed terms, are powerful drivers of economic growth and sustainable 

development; 



A/74/382/Add.1 
 

 

19-20956 8/8

interconnectivity to promote inclusive growth and sustainable development, and 

reiterates its commitment to strengthening regional cooperation and regional trade 

agreements;
