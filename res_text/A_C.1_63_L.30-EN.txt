disarmament, in accordance with commitments made under article VI of the Treaty 
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,3 

 Mindful of the approaching 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the 
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and in this regard urging 
States parties to intensify their constructive engagement in the work of the 
Preparatory Committee for the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty 
at its third session in 2009, 

 1. Continues to emphasize the central role of the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons1 and its universality in achieving nuclear 
disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, and calls upon all States parties to 
respect their obligations; 

 2. Calls upon all States to comply fully with all commitments made 
regarding nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation and not to act in any 
way that may compromise either cause or that may lead to a new nuclear arms race; 

 3. Reaffirms that the outcome of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties 
to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons2 sets out the agreed 
process for systematic and progressive efforts towards nuclear disarmament, and in 
this regard renews its call upon the nuclear-weapon States to accelerate the 
implementation of the practical steps towards nuclear disarmament that were agreed 
upon at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty, thereby 
contributing to a safer world for all; 

 4. Reiterates its call upon all States parties to spare no effort to achieve the 
universality of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and in this 
regard urges India, Israel and Pakistan to accede to the Treaty as non-nuclear-
weapon States promptly and without conditions; 

 5. Urges the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to rescind its 
announced withdrawal from the Treaty, while recognizing the efforts undertaken 
during 2008 within the framework of the Six-Party Talks to achieve the 
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner; 

 6. Stresses the need for a constructive and successful preparatory process 
leading to the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which should contribute to strengthening the 
Treaty in all its aspects and achieving its full implementation and universality;  

 7. Welcomes the second session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 
Review Conference, held in Geneva from 28 April to 9 May 2008, and calls upon 
the Preparatory Committee, at its third session in 2009, to identify and address 
specific aspects where urgent progress is required in order to advance the objective 
of a nuclear-weapon-free world, building on the outcomes of the 1995 and 2000 
Conferences; 

 8. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-fourth session 
the item entitled “Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: accelerating the 
implementation of nuclear disarmament commitments” and to review the 
implementation of the present resolution at that session.
