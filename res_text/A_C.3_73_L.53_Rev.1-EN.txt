concrete action for the total elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 

and related intolerance and the comprehensive implementation of and follow-up to 

the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action”, 

 Acknowledging other important initiatives of the General Assembly aimed at 

raising awareness about the suffering of victims of racism, racial discrimination, 

xenophobia and related intolerance and forms of discrimination, including in the 

historical perspective, in particular regarding commemoration of the victims of 

slavery and the transatlantic slave trade,  

 Recalling the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal, and the Judgment of the 

Tribunal which recognized as criminal, inter alia, the SS organization and its integral 

parts, including the Waffen SS, through its officially accepted members implicated in 

or with knowledge of the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity 

connected with the Second World War, as well as other relevant provis ions of the 

Charter and the Judgment, 

 Mindful of the horrors of the Second World War, and stressing in this regard that 

the victory over Nazism in the Second World War contributed to the establishment of 

the conditions for the creation of the United Nations, designed to prevent future wars 

and save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,  

 Noting that neo-Nazism is more than just the glorification of a past movement, 

it is a contemporary phenomenon with strong vested interests in racial inequality a nd 

an investment in gaining broad support for its false claims of racial superiority;  

 Recalling the relevant provisions of the Durban Declaration and Programme of 

Action adopted by the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, 

Xenophobia and Related Intolerance on 8 September 2001,9 in particular paragraph 2 

of the Declaration and paragraphs 84–86 of the Programme of Action, as well as the 

relevant provisions of the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference of 

24 April 2009,10 in particular paragraphs 11, 13 and 54, 

 Alarmed at the spread in many parts of the world of various extremist political 

parties, movements, ideologies and groups of a racist or xenophobic character, 

including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and at the fact that this trend has resulted 

in the implementation of discriminatory measures and policies at the local or national 

levels, 

 Noting with concern that, even where neo-Nazis do not formally participate in 

government, the presence therein of extreme right-wing ideologues can have the

effect of injecting into governance and political discourse the same ideologies that 

make neo-Nazism so dangerous, 

 Alarmed at music lyrics and video games that advocate racial hatred and incite 

discrimination, hostility or violence,  

 Concerned by the use of Internet platforms by groups that propagate hate to 

plan, fundraise and circulate information about public events aimed at promoting 

racism, xenophobia and related intolerance, such as rallies, demonstrations and acts 

of violence, 

 Seriously concerned that neo-Nazi groups have increasingly targeted 

susceptible individuals, mainly children and youth, by means of specifically tailored 

websites with the aim of their indoctrination,  

 Deeply concerned by all recent manifestations of violence and terrorism incited 

by violent nationalism, racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, Afrophobia, 

xenophobia and related intolerance, including during sports events,  

 Recognizing with deep concern the alarming increase in instances of 

discrimination, intolerance and extremist violence motivated by anti-Semitism, 

Islamophobia and Christianophobia and prejudices against persons of other ethnic 

origins, religions and beliefs,  

 Noting with concern that the variation in national standards prohibiting hate 

speech may provide safe havens for neo-Nazi, violent nationalist, xenophobic or 

racist speech owing to the fact that many neo-Nazi and relevant extremist groups of 

a racist or xenophobic character operate transnationally by relying on Internet service 

providers or social media platforms, 

 Expressing its concern about the use of digital technologies by neo-Nazis and 

other hate groups to disseminate their ideology, while recognizing that digital 

technologies are of great importance for the enjoyment of human right s and for 

combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,  

 1. Reaffirms the relevant provisions of the Durban Declaration9 and of the 

outcome document of the Durban Review Conference,10 in which States condemned 

the persistence and resurgence of neo-Nazism, neo-Fascism and violent nationalist 

ideologies based on racial and national prejudice and stated that those phenomena 

could never be justified in any instance or in any circumstances;  

 2. Recalls the provisions of the Durban Declaration and of the outcome 

document of the Durban Review Conference, in which States recognized the positive 

contribution that the exercise of the right to freedom of expression, in particular by 

the media and new technologies, including the Internet, and full respect for the 

freedom to seek, receive and impart information, can make to the fight against racism, 

racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance;  

 3. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Special Rapporteur of the 

Human Rights Council on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 

xenophobia and related intolerance, prepared in accordance with the request 

contained in its resolution 72/156;11 

 4. Expresses its appreciation to the United Nations High Commissioner for 

Human Rights and her Office for their efforts to fight racism, racial discrimination, 

xenophobia and related intolerance, including the maintenance by the Office of the 

United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights of the database on practical 

means to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance;

 5. Expresses deep concern about the glorification, in any form, of the Nazi 

movement, neo-Nazism and former members of the Waffen SS organization, 

including by erecting monuments and memorials and holding public demonstrations 

in the name of the glorification of the Nazi past, the Nazi movement and neo -Nazism, 

as well as by declaring or attempting to declare such members and those who fought 

against the anti-Hitler coalition and collaborated with the Nazi movement participants 

in national liberation movements; 

 6. Calls for the universal ratification and effective implementation of the 

International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, 

and encourages those States parties that have not yet done so to consider making the 

declaration under its article 14, thus providing the Committee on the Elimination of 

Racial Discrimination with the competence to receive and consider communications 

from individuals or groups of individuals within their jurisdiction claiming to be 

victims of a violation by a State party of any of the rights set forth in the Convention;  

 7. Encourages States to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination by all 

appropriate means, including legislation as required by circumstances, while ensuring 

that the definition of racial discrimination set out therein complies with article 1 of 

the Convention; 

 8. Encourages those States that have made reservations to article 4 of the 

Convention to give serious consideration to withdrawing such reservations as a matter 

of priority, as stressed by the Special Rapporteur;  

 9. Acknowledges that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 

intolerance in all its forms and manifestations, including neo-Nazism, Islamophobia, 

Christianophobia and anti-Semitism, are a threat to societies as a whole, not just to 

those racial and ethnic groups that are their direct target;  

 10. Recalls that any legislative or constitutional measures adopted with a view 

to countering extremist political parties, movements, ideologies and groups of a racist 

or xenophobic character, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups and similar 

extremist ideological movements, should be in conformity with the relevant 

international human rights obligations, in particular articles 4 and 5 of the Convention 

and articles 19 to 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;  

 11. Encourages States parties to the Convention to ensure that their legislation 

is in accordance with their obligations under the Convention, including those under 

article 4; 

 12. Emphasizes once more the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur that 

“any commemorative celebration of the Nazi regime, its allies and related 

organizations, whether official or unofficial, should be prohibited” by States,12 also 

emphasizes that such manifestations do injustice to the memory of the countless 

victims of the Second World War and negatively influence children and young people, 

and stresses in this regard that it is important that States take measures, in accordance 

with international human rights law, to counteract any celebration of the Nazi SS 

organization and all its integral parts, including the Waffen SS, and  that failure by 

States to effectively address such practices is incompatible with the obligations of 

States Members of the United Nations under its Charter;  

 13. Expresses deep concern about increased frequency of attempts and 

activities intended to desecrate or demolish monuments erected in remembrance of 

those who fought against Nazism during the Second World War, as well as to 

unlawfully exhume or remove the remains of such persons, and in this regard urges

States to fully comply with their relevant obligations, inter alia, under article 34 of 

Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1949; 13 

 14. Firmly condemns incidents that glorify and promote Nazism, such as acts 

involving pro-Nazi graffiti and paintings, including on monuments dedicated to 

victims of the Second World War; 

 15. Notes with concern the use of the Internet and social media by neo-Nazi 

groups to amplify their hate-filled messages and recruit new members across borders, 

while recognizing that the Internet can also be used to counteract these groups and 

their activities; 

 16. Also notes with concern the significant number of racist incidents 

worldwide, including the rise of skinhead groups, which have been responsible for 

many of these incidents, as well as the resurgence of racist and xenophobic violence 

targeting, inter alia, persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic 

minorities, or on any other grounds, including arson attacks on houses and 

vandalization of and violence in schools and places of worship;  

 17. Reaffirms that such acts may be qualified as falling within the scope of the 

Convention, that they may not be justified when they fall outside the scope of the 

rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association as well as the rights to 

freedom of expression and that they may fall within the scope of art icle 20 of the 

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and may be subject to certain 

restrictions, as set out in articles 19, 21 and 22 of the Covenant;  

 18. Encourages States to take appropriate concrete measures, including 

legislative and educational ones, in accordance with their international human rights 

obligations, in order to prevent revisionism in respect of the Second World War and 

the denial of the crimes against humanity and war crimes committed during the 

Second World War; 

 19. Takes note of the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur of the Human 

Rights Council on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 

and related intolerance that education that seeks to undercut the racist effects of 

nationalist populism should include accurate and representative accounts of national 

history that give voice to racial and ethnic diversity and that expose the untruths of 

those who attempt to write ethnic groups out of national histories and identities in 

order to sustain ethno-nationalist myths of racially or ethnically “pure” nations; 

 20. Condemns without reservation any denial of or attempt to deny the 

Holocaust, as well as any manifestation of religious intolerance, incitement, 

harassment or violence against persons or communities on the basis of ethnic origin 

or religious belief; 

 21. Welcomes the call of the Special Rapporteur for the active preservation of 

those Holocaust sites that served as Nazi death camps, concentration and forced 

labour camps and prisons, as well as his encouragement to States to take measures, 

including legislative, law enforcement and educational measures, to put an end to all 

forms of Holocaust denial;14 

 22. Takes note of the conclusion of the Special Rapporteur that revisionism 

and attempts to falsify history may, in certain circumstances, fall under the prohibition 

of hate speech under article 4 (a) of the Convention, which States are required to 

declare as offences punishable by law;15

 23. Calls upon States to continue to take adequate steps, including through 

national legislation, in accordance with international human rights law, aimed at 

preventing and countering hate speech and incitement to violence against persons in 

vulnerable situations and, where necessary, to consider reviewing nationa l anti-racism 

legislation in the light of the increasingly open expression of hate speech and 

incitement to violence against such persons;  

 24. Expresses deep concern at the increase in instances of groups and 

individuals espousing ideologies of hatred through the Internet to disseminate ideas 

based on racial superiority or hatred, organize meetings and violent protests, fundraise 

and engage in other activities; 

 25. Also expresses deep concern about attempts at commercial advertising 

aimed at exploiting the sufferings of the victims of war crimes and crimes against 

humanity committed during the Second World War by the Nazi regime;  

 26. Stresses that the practices described above do injustice to the memory of 

the countless victims of crimes against humanity committed in the Second World War, 

in particular those committed by the SS organization and by those who fought against 

the anti-Hitler coalition and collaborated with the Nazi movement, and may 

negatively influence children and young people, and that failure by States to 

effectively address such practices is incompatible with the obligations of States 

Members of the United Nations under its Charter, including those related to the 

purposes and principles of the Organization; 

 27. Also stresses that all such practices may fuel contemporary forms of 

racism, racial discrimination, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, Christianophobia, 

xenophobia and related intolerance and contribute to the spread and mult iplication of 

various extremist political parties, movements and groups of a racist or xenophobic 

character, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and in this regard calls for 

increased vigilance; 

 28. Expresses concern that the human rights and democratic challenges posed 

by extremist political parties, movements and groups are universal and no country is 

immune to them; 

 29. Emphasizes the need to take the measures necessary to counter the 

practices described above, and calls upon States and all other stakeholders to take 

more effective measures in accordance with international human rights law to 

prevent, counter and combat those phenomena and extremist movements of a racist 

or xenophobic character, which pose a real threat to democratic values, and to  increase 

their vigilance and be proactive in strengthening their efforts to recognize and 

effectively address those challenges;  

 30. Underlines the importance of data and statistics on racist and xenophobic 

crimes for identifying the types of offences committed, the profiles of victims and of 

perpetrators and whether the latter are affiliated with extremist movements or groups, 

thus enhancing better understanding of the phenomenon and identifying effective 

measures to address such racist and xenophobic crimes, and recalls in this regard the 

commitments made in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 16  on data, 

monitoring and accountability, including collecting data disaggregated by 

characteristics relevant in national contexts;  

 31. Encourages States to adopt further measures to support training for the 

police and other law enforcement bodies on the ideologies of extremist political 

parties, movements and groups whose advocacy constitutes incitement to racist and 

xenophobic violence, to strengthen their capacity to address racist and xenophobic

crimes, to fulfil their responsibility for bringing to justice the perpetrators of such 

crimes and to combat impunity; 

 32. Expresses deep concern about the increased number of seats occupied by 

representatives of extremist parties of a racist or xenophobic character in a number of 

national and local parliaments, and emphasizes in this regard the need for all 

democratic political parties to base their programmes and activities on respect for 

human rights and freedoms, democracy, the rule of law and good governance and to 

condemn all messages disseminating ideas that are based on racial superiority or 

hatred and that have the objective of fuelling contemporary forms of racism, racial 

discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; 

 33. Takes note of the concern of the Special Rapporteur regarding the 

resurgence of neo-Nazism in contemporary times and growing support for and 

acceptance of neo-Nazism and related ideology in an increasing number of countries;  

 34. Notes with appreciation, in this regard, the call of the Special Rapporteur 

upon political leaders and parties to strongly condemn incitement to racial 

discrimination or xenophobia, to promote tolerance and respect and to refrain from 

forming coalitions with extremist parties of a racist or xenophobic character;17 

 35. Takes note of the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur to continue 

to take steps through national legislation, in accordance with international human 

rights law, aimed at preventing hate speech and incitement to violence and to 

withdraw support — financial and otherwise — from political parties and other 

organizations that engage in neo-Nazi or other hate speech;18 

 36. Expresses concern that ethnic and racial profiling and police violence 

against persons in vulnerable situations discourage victims from seeking redress 

owing to distrust of the legal system, and in this regard encourages States to improve 

diversity within law enforcement agencies and to impose appropriate sanctions 

against those within the public service found to have committed racially motivated 

violence or used hate speech; 

 37. Expresses deep concern about the increase in reported cases of racist, 

anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, Arabophobic, Afrophobic and xenophobic manifestations  

during sports events, including those committed by extremist groups of a racist or 

xenophobic character, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and calls upon 

States, sports federations and other relevant stakeholders to strengthen measures to 

address such incidents, while also welcoming the steps that many States, sports 

federations and clubs have taken to eliminate racism at sporting events, including 

through sport practised without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, 

which require human understanding, tolerance, inclusion, fair play and solidarity;  

 38. Recalls the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur to introduce into 

national criminal law a provision according to which committing an offence with 

racist or xenophobic motivations or aims constitutes an aggravating circumstance, 

allowing for enhanced penalties,19 and encourages those States whose legislation does 

not contain such provisions to consider that recommendation;  

 39. Notes measures taken by States to prevent discrimination against, in 

particular but not limited to, persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and 

linguistic minorities, people of African descent, Roma, migrants, refugees and asylum 

seekers, and to ensure their integration into society, urges States to ensure the full and 

effective implementation of legal, policy and institutional measures protecting these
