flow of objective information on military matters can help to relieve international 

tension and is therefore an important contribution to conflict prevention,  

 Noting the role of the standardized reporting system, as instituted through its 

resolution 35/142 B, as an important instrument to enhance transparency in military 

matters,  

 Conscious that the value of the standardized reporting system would be further 

enhanced by a broader participation of all Member States,  

 Noting that a periodic review of the United Nations Report on Military 

Expenditures could facilitate its further development and maintain its continued 

relevance and operation, and recalling that, in its resolution 66/20, the General 

Assembly recommended the establishment of a process for period ic reviews,  

 Recalling, in that regard, the report of the Secretary-General on ways and means 

to implement the guidelines and recommendations for objective information on 

military matters, including, in particular, on how to strengthen and broaden 

participation in the standardized reporting system, 1 

 Recalling also the report of the Group of Governmental Experts on the 

Operation and Further Development of the United Nations Standardized Instrument 

for Reporting Military Expenditures on further ways and means to implement the 

guidelines and recommendations for objective information on military matters, 

including, in particular, on how to strengthen and broaden participation in the 

standardized reporting system,2 

 Welcoming the interactive web platform of the Secretariat on military 

expenditures, which includes an online reporting feature, thus increasing user-

friendliness and facilitating the submission of reports, 3 in accordance with resolution 

66/20, 

 Noting the efforts of several regional organizations to promote transparency of 

military expenditures, including standardized annual exchanges of relevant 

information among their member States,  

 Emphasizing the continuing importance of the Report on Military Expenditures 

under the current political and economic circumstances,  

 Recalling that, in its resolution 66/20, the General Assembly recommended that, 

for the purpose of reporting by Member States of their national military expenditures 

in the framework of the Report on Military Expenditures, “military expenditures” be 

commonly understood to refer to all financial resources that a State spends on the 

uses and functions of its military forces and information on military expenditures 

represents an actual outlay in current prices and domestic currency,  

 Mindful of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, including its 

Article 26,  

 1. Calls upon Member States, with a view to achieving the broadest possible 

participation, to provide the Secretary-General, by 30 April annually, with a report on 

their military expenditures for the latest fiscal year for which data are available, using, 

preferably and to the extent possible, one of the online reporting forms, including, if 

appropriate, a nil report or the “single figure” report on military expenditures or any 

other format developed in the context of similar reporting on military expenditures to 

other international or regional organizations;
