 The General Assembly, 

 Having considered the item entitled “Implementation of the Declaration on the

3
 

 Recalling its resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 and 1541 (XV) of 

15 December 1960 and the resolutions of the Special Committee, as well as other

Assembly and the Special Committee on specific Territories,  

 Noting that only some specialized agencies and other organizations of the 

United Nations system have been involved in providing assistance to Non-Self-

Governing Territories, 

 Stressing that, because the development options of the small island Non -Self-

Governing Territories are limited, there are special challenges to planning for and 

implementing sustainable development and that those Territories will be constrained 

in meeting those challenges without the continuing cooperation and assistance of the 

specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system,  

 Stressing also the importance of securing the resources necessary for funding 

expanded programmes of assistance for the peoples concerned and the need to enlist 

the support of all major funding institutions within the United Nations system in 

that regard, 

 Reaffirming the mandates of the specialized agencies and other organizations 

of the United Nations system to take all appropriate measures, within their 

respective responsibilities, to ensure the full implementation of General Assembly 

resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant resolutions,  

 Expressing its appreciation to the African Union, the Pacific Islands Forum, 

the Caribbean Community and other regional organizations for the continued 

cooperation and assistance that they have extended to the specialized agencies and 

other organizations of the United Nations system in this regard,  

 Expressing its conviction that closer contacts and consultations between and 

among the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations 

system and regional organizations help to facilitate the effec tive formulation of 

programmes of assistance to the peoples concerned,  

 Mindful of the imperative need to keep under continuous review the activities 

of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system in 

the implementation of the various resolutions and decisions of the United Nations 

relating to decolonization, 

 Bearing in mind the extremely fragile economies of the small island Non-Self-

Governing Territories and their vulnerability to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, 

cyclones and sea-level rise, and recalling the relevant resolutions of the General 

Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 69/99 of 5 December 2014 on the implementation of 

the Declaration by the specialized agencies and the international institutions 

associated with the United Nations,

Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), and other relevant resolutions of the United

Assembly; 

 4. Also reaffirms that the recognition by the General Assembly, the Security

those peoples;

organizations of the United Nations system that have continued to cooperate with 

the United Nations and the regional and subregional organizations in the 

implementation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant 

resolutions of the United Nations, and requests all the specialized agencies and 

other organizations of the United Nations system to implement the relevant 

provisions of those resolutions; 

 6. Requests the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United

element for the implementation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV),

invitation of the Special Committee;
