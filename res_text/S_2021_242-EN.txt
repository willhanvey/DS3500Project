 Expressing its grave concern at the deterioration of the situation in the Central 

African Republic due to armed group attacks in advance of and following the election 

of 27 December 2020, 

 Condemning in the strongest terms violations of the Political Agreement on 

Peace and Reconciliation in the CAR (“The Peace Agreement”) and violence 

perpetrated by armed groups and other militias, including violence aiming at 

obstructing the electoral process, incitement to ethnic and religious hatred and 

violence, violations of international humanitarian law and human rights violations 

and abuses, including those committed against children and those involving sexual 

and gender-based violence in conflict, as well as violence directed at civilians from 

specific communities, resulting in deaths, injuries and displacements,  

 Taking note of the decision of the Constitutional Court of the Central African 

Republic of 18 January 2021, ruling on the electoral challenges and proclaiming the 

election of President Touadéra, and calling on all stakeholders to respect the 

Constitutional Court’s decision, reaffirm their commitment to the consolidation  of 

democracy and the rule of law in the Central African Republic and contribute to a 

peaceful and credible conclusion of the electoral process,  

 Welcoming the roadmap for dialogue proposed by President Touadéra and 

calling for concrete steps from the government of the Central African Republic and 

all political actors to engage effectively in dialogue, resolve outstanding issues and 

conclude the electoral process through the organization of legislative and local 

elections, reiterating that only inclusive, free, fair, transparent, credible, peaceful and 

timely elections, undisturbed by disinformation and other forms of manipulation of 

information, can bring lasting stability to the CAR, including through the full, equal 

and meaningful participation of women, reaffirming the importance of the 

participation of the youth, and encouraging the CAR authorities, with the support of 

relevant partners, to promote the participation of internally displaced persons (IDPs) 

and refugees in accordance with the Constitution of the CAR, 

 Urging all signatory parties to the Peace Agreement to fully honour their 

commitments and join the path of dialogue and peace and stressing the urgent and

Truth, Justice, Reparation and Reconciliation Commission operational,  

 Welcoming the communique of the African Union Peace and Security Council 

after its meeting on the CAR on 16 February 2021, also welcoming the meeting of 

Heads of States held in Luanda on 29 January 2021, and encouraging continued and 

coordinated mobilization of the region, in particular the Economic Community of 

Central African States (ECCAS) and the International Conference on the Great Lakes 

Region (ICGLR), aimed at strengthening dialogue, easing tensions and seeking 

concerted political solutions to the crisis,  

 Expressing serious concern about the dire humanitarian situation in the CAR 

and the consequences of the security situation on humanitarian access, condemning 

in the strongest terms increased attacks against humanitarian workers, emphasising 

the current humanitarian needs of more than half of the population of the country, 

including civilians under threat from violence, as well as the alarming situation of 

IDPs and refugees, welcoming the collaboration between MINUSCA, UN agencies, 

the African Union, the World Bank, technical and financial partners of the CAR and 

NGOs to support development and humanitarian efforts in the CAR and their 

adaptation to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exacerbated existing 

vulnerabilities, and calling on Member States and international and regional 

organisations to respond swiftly to the humanitarian needs identified in the 

humanitarian response plan through increased contributions and to ensure that all 

pledges are honoured in full and in a timely manner,  

 Stressing the valuable role of the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) in bringing 

strategic advice, providing observations for the Security Council’s consideration, and 

fostering a more coherent, coordinated and integrated approach to international 

peacebuilding efforts, and encouraging relevant partners to support the efforts of the 

CAR authorities through the National Strategy for Recovery and Peace Consolidation 

(RCPCA) to lay the foundation of durable peace in the CAR and sustainable 

development of all regions of the country, to boost peace dividends for the population 

and development projects, including critical investments in infrastructure,  

 Condemning in the strongest terms all attacks, provocations and incitement to 

hatred and violence against MINUSCA and other international forces by armed 

groups or other perpetrators, paying tribute to the personnel of MINUSCA who 

sacrificed their lives in the service of peace, underlining that attacks targeting 

peacekeepers may constitute war crimes, calling on all parties to fully respect their 

obligations under international humanitarian law and urging the CAR authorities to 

work with MINUSCA to enhance the safety and security of MINUSCA’s personnel, 

including in line with resolution 2518 (2020), and to take all possible measures to 

arrest and prosecute perpetrators,  

 Taking note of the Report of the Secretary-General of 16 February 2021 

(S/2021/146), recommending an increase of 2,750 military and 940 police personnel, 

with the aim of enabling the Mission to enhance its capacity to prevent and reverse a 

further deterioration in the security situation while creating space for the political 

process to advance, 

 Reaffirming the basic principles of peacekeeping, such as consent of the parties, 

impartiality, and non-use of force, except in self-defence and defence of the mandate, 

recognising that the mandate of each peacekeeping mission is specific to the need and 

situation of the country concerned, underlining that the mandates that it authorises 

are consistent with the basic principles, reiterating that the Security Council expects 

full delivery of the mandates it authorises, and recalling in this regard its resolution 

2436 (2018),

 Taking note of the request of the CAR authorities to lift the arms embargo and 

of the positions expressed by ECCAS and ICGLR, reiterating its readiness to review 

the arms embargo measures, through inter alia suspension or progressive lifting, in 

the light of progress achieved on the key benchmarks established by the Security 

Council, and stressing the need for the CAR authorities to ensure physical protection, 

control, management, traceability, and accountability of weapons, ammunition and 

military equipment transferred to their control,

international peace and security in the region,

2552 (2020); 

 2. Stresses that these reinforcements are aimed at enhancing MINUSCA’s 

ability to perform its priority mandated tasks in the current evolving context, in 

particular protection of civilians and facilitation of humanitarian access, and at 

enabling the Mission to enhance its capacity to prevent and reverse a further 

deterioration in the security situation while creating space for the political process to 

advance, further stresses that these new capabilities are not a substitute for the 

national authorities’ primary responsibility to advance the peace process and protect 

the population, notes that these reinforcements should be sequenced through a phased 

approach, recalls the importance of cooperation between MINUSCA and the CAR 

authorities in line with its mandate, and requests the Secretary-General to review 

implementation, performance and necessity ahead of each phase as part of the reports 

requested in paragraph 54 of resolution 2552 (2020) and to include in its report of 

11 October 2021 a proposal on the overall configuration of MINUSCA’s Force;

deployment of all personnel to MINUSCA adhere to:

Readiness System (PCRS) to ensure the recruitment and retention of qualified 

uniformed personnel;
