  France: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council,  

 Recalling its previous resolutions and statements on the Central African 

Republic (CAR), in particular resolutions 2121 (2013), 2127 (2013), 2134 (2014) 

2149 (2014) and 2181 (2014), as well as the Presidential Statement S/PRST/2014/28 

of 18 December 2014,  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 

territorial integrity of the CAR, and recalling the importance of the principles of 

non-interference, good-neighbourliness and regional cooperation,  

 Recalling that the Central African Republic bears the primary responsibility to 

protect all populations within its territory from genocide, war crimes, ethnic 

cleansing and crimes against humanity,  

 Emphasizing that any sustainable solution to the crisis in the CAR should be 

CAR-owned, including the political process, and should include the restructuring of 

the Central African Republic security forces,  

 Reiterating its call upon the Transitional Authorities to accelerate the transition 

process, including its action towards an inclusive and comprehensive political 

dialogue and reconciliation process and towards the holding of free, fair, transparent 

and inclusive presidential and legislative elections no later than August 2015, with 

the full, effective and equal participation of women,  

 Commending the African-led International Support Mission to the Central 

African Republic (MISCA), Sangaris and EUFOR RCA for the work done in laying 

the foundation for increased security ahead of and in support of the United Nations 

Integrated Multi-dimensional Mission to the CAR (MINUSCA)’s deployment, 

noting also with concern, however, that while improving, security in the CAR 

remains fragile,  

 Welcoming the decision of the European Union to establish a one-year military 

advice mission based in Bangui (EUMAM-RCA), as requested by the CAR 

transitional authorities, in order to contribute to providing them with expert advice on 

reforming the CAR Armed Forces (FACA) into a multi-ethnic, professional, and 

republican armed forces, and underlines the importance of a clear distribution of tasks 

and close coordination between the international forces or missions in the CAR and

the lead role of MINUSCA in this regard, and further requests that this information is 

included in the regular reporting of the Secretary-General on MINUSCA, 

 Welcoming the United Nations Secretary-General Report of 1 December 2014 

(S/2014/857) submitted pursuant to resolution 2149 (2014),  

 Welcoming also the interim and final reports (S/2014/452 and S/2014/762) of the 

Panel of Experts on the Central African Republic established pursuant to resolution 

2127 (2013) and expanded and extended pursuant to resolution 2134 (2014),  

 Taking note of the final report of the United Nations International Commission 

of Inquiry (S/2014/928) of 22 December 2014,  

 Strongly condemning the resurgence of violence, which was politically or 

criminally motivated, that occurred in October 2014 in Bangui; the continuous cycle 

of provocations and reprisals by armed groups, both inside and outside of Bangui; the 

threats of violence, human rights violations and abuses and international humanitarian 

law violations, including those involving extrajudicial killings, enforced 

disappearances, arbitrary arrests and detention, torture, sexual violence against women 

and children, rape, recruitment and use of children and attacks against civilians, 

attacks against places of worship, and denial of humanitarian access, committed by 

armed elements, which continue to adversely affect the dire humanitarian situation 

faced by the civilian population and to impede humanitarian access to vulnerable 

populations,  

 Equally condemning the targeted attacks against the Transitional Authorities as 

well as those against MINUSCA, Sangaris and EUFOR RCA troops during the October 

events in Bangui, underlining that attacks targeting peacekeepers are among the 

designation criteria in paragraph 10 of this resolution and may constitute a war crime 

and reminding all parties of their obligations under international humanitarian law,  

 Reiterating that all perpetrators of such acts must be held accountable and that 

some of those acts may amount to crimes under the Rome Statute of the International 

Criminal Court (ICC), to which the CAR is a State party, noting in this regard the 

opening by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on 24 September 2014 

of an investigation following the request of the national authorities on alleged crimes 

committed since 2012 and welcoming the ongoing cooperation by the CAR 

Transitional Authorities in this regard,  

 Expressing grave concern at the findings of the Panel of Experts’ final report 

of 29 October 2014 (S/2014/762) that, armed groups continue to destabilize the 

CAR and to pose a permanent threat to the peace, security and stability of the 

country, and further expressing concern that illicit trade, exploitation and smuggling 

of natural resources including gold, diamonds and wildlife poaching and trafficking 

continues to threaten the peace and stability of CAR,  

 Noting with concern the findings of the Panel of Experts’ final report that the 

Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) remains active in the CAR and that it has 

established links to other armed groups,  

 Stressing the urgent and imperative need to end impunity in the CAR and to 

bring to justice perpetrators of violations of international humanitarian law and of 

abuses or violations of human rights, underlining in this regard the need to bolster 

national accountability mechanisms and to implement without delay the 7 August 

2014 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Urgent Temporary Measures, which

describes, in particular, the establishment of a national Special Criminal Court in 

charge of investigating and prosecuting the serious crimes committed in the CAR, 

including through the adoption of the necessary legislation by the Transitional 

Authorities,  

 Emphasizing the risk of the situation in the CAR providing a conducive 

environment for transnational criminal activity, such as that involving arms 

trafficking and the use of mercenaries as well as a potential breeding ground for 

radical networks,  

 Acknowledging in this respect the important contribution the Council -

mandated arms embargo can make to countering the illicit transfer of arms and 

related materiel in the CAR and its region, and in supporting post -conflict 

peacebuilding, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and security sector 

reform, recalling its resolutions 2117 (2013) and 2127 (2013) and expressing grave 

concern at the threat to peace and security in the CAR arising from the illicit 

transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons, 

and the use of such weapons against civilians affected by armed conflict,  

 Recalling the need for an inclusive and effective disarmament, demobilization 

and reintegration process (DDR) as well as repatriation and resettlement (DDRRR) 

in the case of foreign fighters, including children formerly associated with armed 

forces and groups, while respecting the need to fight impunity,  

 Recalling its decision to establish a sanctions regime pursuant to resolutions 

2127 (2013) and 2134 (2014) and emphasizing that the targeted sanctions aim at, 

inter alia, individuals and entities designated by the Committee established pursuant 

to resolution 2127 (2013) and expanded pursuant to resolution 2134 (2014) as 

engaging in or providing support for acts that undermine the peace, stability or 

security of the CAR, that impede the political transition process or that fuel violence 

and at individuals and entities designated by the Committee as involved in planning, 

directing, or committing acts that violate international human rights law or 

international humanitarian law or that constitute human rights abuses or violations,  

 Noting the critical importance of effective implementation of the sanctions 

regime, including the key role that neighbouring States, as well as regional and 

subregional organizations, can play in this regard and encouraging efforts to further 

enhance cooperation,  

 Determining that the situation in the CAR continues to constitute a threat to 

international peace and security in the region,  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,
