Rl':COMJ'fl':NDATIONS OF THE FIRST C0'1111ITTEE 

10. The First Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the 
following draft resolutions: 

A 

Recallinp that, in resolution 2932 A (XXVII) of 29 November 1972, it welcomed 
the report of the Secretary-General entitled ~1apalm and Other Incendiary Heap_?ns 
and All Aspects of Their Possible Use 3/ and expressed its conviction that the 
widespreaduse--of--many--weapon-8-and- the -emerf!enc~ of new methods of warfare that 
cause unnecessR.ry sufferinr; or are indiscrimin~te call urgently for renewed 
efforts by Governments to seek, through legal means, the prohibition of the use 
of such vreapons and of indiscriminate and cruel methods of warfare and? if 
possible, through measures of disarmament, the elimination of specific, especially 
cruel or indiscriminate weapons, 

Recalling that, in resolution 3076 (XX'TIII) of 6 December 1973, it took 
note of the comments submitted by Governments 4/ on the above-mentioned report 
of the Secretary-General and of the wi<l.espread-wish that intergovernmental action 
should be taken with a view to reaching ar,reement on the prohibition or 
restriction of use of these weapons, 

Recalling further that by the same resolution the General Assembly pointed to 
the extensive-iact~al report prepared under the auspices of the International 
Committee of the Red Cross entitled Heapons _That l·•!ay Cause Unnecessarv Suf'ferinf' 
or Hay_e_)nd_is_criminate Et:_f_e~_j;-~, '2) covering, inter alia, high-velocity projectiles,

blast and fragmentation weapons, time-delay weapons and incendiary weapons, and 
endorsed the conclusion of the report that intergovernmental review and action 
regarding weapons of these kinds was called for, 

Recalling lastly that by resolution 3076 (XXVIII) the General Assembly 
considered-that- prohibitions or restrictions of the use of such weapons should be. 
examined without delay and that positive results in this regard were likely to 
facilitate substantive disarmament negotiations with a view to the elimination of 
production, stockpiling and proliferation of the weapons in question, _which should 
be the ultimate objective, and invited the Diplomatic Conference on the 
Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law Applicable in 
Armed Conflicts to consider the question of the use ·of napalm and other incendiary 
weapons, as well as other specific conventional weapons which may be deemed to 
cause unnecessary suffering or to have indiscriminate effects, and to _seek 
agreement on rules prohibiting or restricting the use of such weapons, 

Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the first 
session -of the Diplomatic Conference relevant to napalm and other incendiary 
weapons and all aspects of their possible use 6/ and the report of the Conference 
of Government Experts, held under the auspices -of the International Committee of 
the Red Cross, to study in depth the g_uestion of the prohibition or limitation of 
the use of conventional weapons that may cause unnecessary suffering or have 
indiscriminate effects, 

!lindful of the fact that much. sufferinp; to civilian population and combatants 
may be-avoided if general agreement can be attained on the prohibition or 
restriction of use of specific conventional weapons which may be deemed to cause 
unnecessary suffering or to have indiscriminate effects, 

\"'elcoming the active work of the Diplomatic Conference and the Conference of 
Goverrm!ent- Experts on the question of prohibition or restriction of use of 
specific conventional weapons, 

Noting that this work, which has comprised an examinatio:o of important 
categories-of conventional weapons, has resulted not only in a better understanding 
of the significance of earlier studies of this subject but in the emergence of 
new valuable data and suggestions and proposals for possible restrictions on the 
use of certain conventional weapons, 

Aware of the complexity of the issues raised by such suggestions and proposals 
and the recognized need to examine thoroughly all data now available and to 
undertake some further investigations, ~<hich may permit Governments to .reach 
well--founded conclusions.

Conscious of the need for broad agreement on any prohibitions or restrictions 
vhich -may-becontemplated and of the need for a further expert discussion to this 
end, 

Taking note with appreciation of the expressed readiness of the International 
Committee of the Red- Cross to convoke another Conference of Government "xperts, 
which would receive and coris·ider new informat-ion and focus on such conventional 
weapons as have been, or n:ay become, the subject of proposed bans or restrictions 
of use and study the possibility, contents and form of such proposed bans or 
restrictions, 

l. Urges all GovernmEnts to exrun1ne the considerable body of facts vhich is 
now available on the matter and to compile without delay such supplementary rlata 
as may be required by them to focus upon specific proposals for prohibitions or 
restrictions~ 

2. App~a~~ to .all Governments to co-operate in the clarification of the 
issues and to consider in a constructive spirit and with a sense of urgency all 
proposals and suggestions which have been or may be advanced on the matter·. 

3. In~ites the Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of 
International Humanitarian Law Applicable in Armed Conflicts to continue its 
consideration of the question of the use of napalm and other incendiary weapons 
as well as other specific conventional weapons which may be deemed to cause 
unnecessary suffering or to have indiscriminate effects, and its search for 
agreement on possible rules prohibiting or restricting the use of such weapons and, 
in this context, also to consider the results of the first Conference of Government 
Experts and the progr8J!Jllle of work which a second Conference of Government Experts 
might follow; 

4. Requests the Secretary-General, who has been invited to attend the 
Diplomatic Conference as an observer, to report to the General Assembly at its 
thirtieth session on aspects of the work of the Conference relevant to the nresent 
resolution·.· 

5. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its thirtieth session 
the item entftled "Napalm and other incendiary weapons and all aspects of their 
possible use".

the Conference of Government Experts, held under the auspices of the International

unnecessary sufferin~ or have indiscriminate effects, 

Recalling its resolutions 2932 (XXVII) of 29 November 1972 and 3076 (XXVIII) 
of 6 Deca~ber 1973 on this question,

held at Teheran in 1968 §/,that napalm bombing is among the methods and means 
of varfare that erode human rights, 

Empha~izing the consensus of the Conference of Government l':xperts that 
severe burn wounds are probably the most painful type of wound and frequently 
remain so for long periods of time and that they may result in permanent disability, 
includinP physical, functional, cosmetic, social and psychological disability, 

peepl~~isturbed at the continuing use of napalm and other incendiary 
'Weapons,
