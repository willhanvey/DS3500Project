 Welcoming the organization of the first round of the legislative elections on

some improvement since the adoption of its resolution 2180 (2014),  

 Recognizing the importance of condition-based security-related decisions about

military engineering units,  

 Underlining the need to further strengthen Haitian judicial and correctional

 Noting with concern that food insecurity, as a result of drought and the 

consequent decrease in the harvest during the period from March to June, could 

impact the humanitarian situation and stability,

to face significant humanitarian challenges, with approximately 60,801 internally

 Recognizing that strengthening national human rights institutions as well as 

respect for human rights, including of children, and due process and combating
