binding Demarcation Directions, to abide promptly by all its Orders, including those

the implementation of its mandate to ensure the personal security of UNMEE staff

regard;

9. Urges the two parties to begin to sensitize their populations about the
demarcation process and its implications, including the role of the United Nations in
support of this process;

in accordance with article 4.16 of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement;

11. Reaffirms its decision to review frequently the progress made by the
parties in the implementation of their commitments pursuant to the Algiers
