 The General Assembly,  

 Reaffirming the permanent responsibility of the United Nations with regard to 
the question of Palestine until it is solved in all its aspects, in accordance with 
international law, 

 Recalling the relevant rules and principles of international law, including

12 August 1949,1 which is applicable to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem,  

 Expressing grave concern about the developments on the ground since the 
adoption of Security Council resolution 1860 (2009) on 8 January 2009, especially 
following the intensified military operations in the Gaza Strip, causing heavy 
casualties among civilians, including children and women, and the shelling of 
United Nations Headquarters, hospitals, media premises and public infrastructure, 
and emphasizing that the Palestinian and Israeli civilian populations must be 
protected and that their suffering must end, 

 Convinced that achieving a just, lasting and comprehensive settlement of the 
question of Palestine, the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict, is imperative for the 
attainment of comprehensive, just and lasting peace and stability in the Middle East, 

 1. Demands full respect for Security Council resolution 1860 (2009), 
including its urgent call for an immediate, durable and fully respected ceasefire, 
leading to the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, and its call for 
the unimpeded provision and distribution throughout the Gaza Strip of humanitarian 
assistance, including of food, fuel and medical treatment;
