 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial 
integrity and unity of Haiti,

earthquake of 12 January 2010, particularly that for the first time in its history, Haiti 
has experienced a peaceful transfer of power between one democratically elected 
president and another from the opposition,  

 Recognizing also, as has the Haitian Government, that the overall security 
situation, while fragile, has improved since the adoption of its resolutions 1908, 
1927 and 1944 (2010), allowing a partial drawdown of MINUSTAH’s military and 
police capabilities as the first step to ending the temporary surge capacities decided 
by the Security Council after the earthquake, while continuing to adapt the 
Mission’s strength without undermining the security and stability of Haiti and 
recognizing the importance of condition-based and security-related decisions about 
the future of MINUSTAH, 

 Welcoming the appointment of a Prime Minister and a Supreme Court 
President and calling on all the relevant political actors in Haiti, in particular the 
Executive and Legislative branches, to engage in an effective dialogue towards a 
political agreement that would consolidate a concrete forward agenda for progress 
in key areas, such as Haiti’s security, budget, recovery and development priorities, 
elections and electoral reform, including the participation of women in the electoral 
processes and the completion of constitutional reform, 

 Acknowledging that Haiti continues to face significant humanitarian 
challenges, with more than 600,000 internally displaced persons still dependent on 
assistance for their basic survival, an ongoing cholera epidemic, and extreme 
vulnerability to natural disasters,  

 Emphasizing that progress in the recovery and reconstruction of Haiti, as well 
as in Haiti’s social and economic development, including through effective 



S/2011/637

and reiterating the need for security to be accompanied by social and economic 
development, 

 Stressing the leading role of the Government of Haiti in the post-disaster 
recovery and reconstruction process, including risk reduction and preparedness

efforts among all United Nations actors and other relevant stakeholders in assisting 
the Government in this regard, as well as in the overall support to Haiti’s social and 
economic development, 

 Recognizing the work done so far by the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission,

technical support, and also by the Haiti Reconstruction Fund, which both play a 
central role in the medium and long-term reconstruction efforts in Haiti, 

 Commending the wide range of recovery efforts delivered by the United 
Nations system in Haiti, especially the United Nations-supported housing and debris 
removal programs and the successful use of MINUSTAH’s military engineering 
units to address urgent needs in the immediate aftermath of the January 2010 
earthquake, emphasizing the importance of increasing participation of Haitian 
authorities and international and civilian actors in these tasks,  

 Urging donors to fulfil without delay the pledges made at the International 
Donors’ Conference “Towards a New Future for Haiti” held on 31 March 2010, in 
order to continue producing tangible and visible reconstruction dividends, and 
underlining national responsibility to provide clear guidance and priorities, 

 Emphasizing the role of regional organizations in the ongoing process of 
stabilization and reconstruction of Haiti and calling on MINUSTAH to continue to 
work closely with regional and subregional organizations, international financial 
institutions and other stakeholders, in particular the Organization of the American 
States (OAS) and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM),  

 Recognizing the interconnected nature of the challenges in Haiti, reaffirming 
that sustainable progress on security, the rule of law and institutional reform, 
national reconciliation and development are mutually reinforcing, and welcoming 
the continuing efforts of the Government of Haiti and the international community 
to address these challenges, 

 Expressing its concern that criminal gangs remain a threat to Haiti’s stability,  

 Recognizing that the overall security situation has improved but further 
expressing its concern that trends since the earthquake reveal an increase in all 
major categories of crime, including murder, rape and kidnapping in Port-au-Prince 
and the West Department, 

 Acknowledging that sexual and gender-based violence remains a serious 
concern, particularly in marginalized districts of Port-au-Prince, internally displaced 
persons camps and remote areas of the country, 

 Welcoming the efforts of the HNP to increase patrolling and enhance its 
presence and engagement directly with the population, which may have contributed 
to an increase in the reporting of crimes,

3 11-54606

for human rights, due process, combating criminality and sexual and gender based 
violence, and putting an end to impunity are essential to ensuring the rule of law and 
security in Haiti,  

 Recognizing the critical role of MINUSTAH in ensuring stability and security 
in Haiti and also recognizing the complementary roles that MINUSTAH and the 
United Nations Country Team have fulfilled to date in assisting Haiti in its recovery 
efforts, reaffirming the authority of the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General in the coordination and conduct of all activities of United Nations agencies, 
funds and programmes in Haiti, and stressing the importance of the Special

reconstruction and development,

ensure a secure and stable environment and expressing gratitude to the personnel of 
MINUSTAH and to their countries and paying tribute to those injured or killed in 
the line of duty, 

 Welcoming the commitment by the Government of Haiti to strengthen the rule 
of law, and calling on the Government of Haiti, in coordination with the 
international community, to continue to advance security sector reform, including in 
particular the development and implementation of the next five-year Haitian 
National Police Development Plan, which will take effect after December 2011, 
underscoring the need for the Government of Haiti with the assistance of the 
international community, as requested, to take steps to ensure that the HNP meets 
the benchmarks for reform contained in the plan and encouraging the Government, 
with the support of MINUSTAH, to regularly inform the Haitian people on progress 
toward these benchmarks,

funded and encouraging the Government of Haiti to take advantage of the support 
being provided by the international community to guarantee the provision of 
adequate security for the Haitian people,  

 Underlining the need to further strengthen Haitian judicial and correctional 
systems, in order to support a more integrated and cohesive Haitian security sector, 
welcoming the improvements in the judiciary toward the availability of adequate 
human and material capabilities and acknowledging that attendant human rights 
concerns that still remain in the corrections system such as, prolonged pretrial 
detentions, prison overcrowding and access to health care services, are significant 
challenges to sustainable administrative reforms,

William J. Clinton as United Nations Special Envoy for Haiti, to enhance the United 
Nations recovery response, in both humanitarian and development operations as 
well as tracking aid pledges and disbursement of funds, liaising with the Interim 
Haiti Recovery Commission and the international financial institutions, working to 
ensure coherence across United Nations operations in Haiti, and noting the 
importance of regular reporting on these activities,

labour intensive projects that help create jobs and deliver basic social services,
