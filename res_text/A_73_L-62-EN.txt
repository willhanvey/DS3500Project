paying due attention to the continuity and sustainability of current actions on global 

health,  

 Affirming the primary responsibility of Member States to determine and promote 

their own path towards achieving universal health coverage that comprises universal 

and equitable access to quality health services and quality, essential, affordable and 

effective medicines for all, while ensuring that the use of such services and medicines 

does not expose the users to financial hardship, with particular attention to those who 

are vulnerable or in vulnerable situations, and that is critical to promote physical and 

mental health and well-being, especially through primary health care, health services 

and social protection mechanisms, including through community outreach and private 

sector engagement, and with the support of the international community,   

 Recalling the Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health, 

adopted at the 2011 World Conference on Social Determinants of Health, which 

reaffirmed that health inequities within and between countries are politically, socially 

and economically unacceptable, as well as unfair and largely avoidable, and noting 

that many of the underlying determinants of health and risk factors of  communicable 

and non-communicable diseases are associated with social, economic, environmental 

and behavioural conditions,  

 Recognizing the outcome of the Global Conference on Primary Health Care and 

its contribution to the renewal of the commitments made through the Declaration of 

Alma-Ata of 1978 and the central role of primary health care in achieving universal 

health coverage and contributing to health worldwide,  

 Recalling the World Health Organization Global Strategy and Plan of Action on 

Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property, 8 designed to promote medicinal 

innovation, build capacity and improve access to medicines, encouraging further 

discussions on access to medicines, and reiterating that health research and 

development should be needs-driven, evidence-based, guided by the core principles 

of affordability, effectiveness, efficiency and equity and considered a shared 

responsibility, recalling the report of the High-level Panel on Access to Medicines, 

including its recommendations,  

 Recalling also the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and its Framework for 

Action,9 which provides a set of voluntary policy options and strategies for use by 

Governments, as appropriate, adopted by the Second International Conference on 

Nutrition, to enhance sustainable food systems by developing coherent public policies 

from production to consumption and across relevant sectors to provide year-round 

access and affordability to food that meets people’s nutrition needs and promote safe 

and diversified healthy diets and to empower people and create an enabling 

environment for making informed choices about food products for healthy dietary 

practices and appropriate infant and young child feeding practices through improved 

health and nutrition information and education,  

 Recognizing the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger and all 

forms of malnutrition, and encouraging international cooperation and assistance to 

support the efforts of Member States in this regard, as well as to achieve health goals, 

implement universal access to health services and address health challenges, and 

increase food production and access to healthy and nutri tious food and its utilization, 

while taking into account different national circumstances and capacities and 

respecting national policies and priorities,

 Recognizing also the need to eradicate hunger and prevent all forms of 

malnutrition worldwide, including undernourishment, stunting, wasting, underweight 

and overweight in all age groups, in particular among children under 5 years of age, 

and deficiencies in micronutrients, in particular vitamin A, iodine, iron and zinc, 

among others, and conscious that multiple forms of malnutrition can affect all 

countries, can occur not only within countries and communities but also within 

households, and can affect the same person multiple times over his or her lifetime,  

 Recognizing further that undernutrition and overweight and obesity are 

commonly referred to as the double burden of malnutrition, and expressing concern 

about the burden of diet-related non-communicable diseases in all age groups and the 

rising trends of undernourishment and overweight and obesity, as well as the increase 

in anaemia among women and the still unacceptably high levels of stunting in 

children, recognizing that rapid demographic, social and economic changes in many 

countries have led to increased urbanization and changes in food systems,  lifestyles, 

eating habits and global consumption and production patterns that have brought about 

a nutrition transition,  

 Expressing concern about the increasing number of people facing crisis-level 

food insecurity or worse, up from almost 108 million in 2016 to 124 million in 2017 

in countries affected by, inter alia, conflict and exacerbated by climate -related events, 

environmental factors, including natural disasters, and excessive food price volatility,  

 Recognizing the essential contribution that older persons can continue to make 

to the functioning of societies and towards the implementation of the 2030 Agenda 

for Sustainable Development, and concerned that many health systems are not 

sufficiently prepared to respond to the need for promotive, preventive, curative, 

rehabilitative, palliative and specialized care,  

 Reaffirming the right of everyone, including refugees and migrants, to the 

enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and noting 

the references to health and food security in the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly 

and Regular Migration and the references to health, food security and nutrition in the 

global compact on refugees, respectively,  

 Recognizing the particular needs of people living in areas affected by complex 

humanitarian emergencies, and expressing concern that the most vulnerable in areas 

affected by armed conflicts as well as natural disasters often have no or limited access 

to health services and to adequate nutritious foods to prevent hunger and  promote 

health and, moreover, that attacks against medical personnel and facilities have 

immediate and long-term consequences for health-care systems,  

 Underlining the urgency of having strong and resilient health systems, with 

adequately trained and remunerated health workers in decent jobs, reaching those who 

are vulnerable or in vulnerable situations, and capable of effectively addressing all 

health needs, including pandemic surveillance and preparedness and the 

implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005),10  

 Recognizing the global challenge of antimicrobial resistance, which requires 

multisectoral actions, through the One Health approach involving the World Health 

Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Natio ns and the 

World Organization for Animal Health and other relevant stakeholders, such as the 

United Nations Environment Programme and the Codex Alimentarius Commission, 

reaffirming the importance of the political declaration of the high-level meeting of 

the General Assembly on antimicrobial resistance,11 looking forward to the report on

the issue to be submitted by the Secretary-General for consideration by Member 

States at the seventy-third session of the Assembly, and recognizing also the results 

of the efforts made by the ad hoc inter-agency coordination group on antimicrobial 

resistance,  

 Recognizing also that coordinated health, social, economic and nutrition-related 

policies are needed to address the health of the most vulnerable and marginalized, 

who are often victims of inequity, inequality, discrimination, stigmatization, social 

exclusion and violence, and are the most exposed to health risk factors, owing mostly 

to their poor living conditions, poor health literacy and lack of access to health care 

and other relevant services,  

 Acknowledging that the promotion of health equity and the elimination of stigma 

and discrimination in health-care settings are important for achieving the Sustainable 

Development Goals and building a more inclusive society whereby those who are 

vulnerable or in vulnerable situations, especially women and girls, older persons, 

indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, persons living with mental health 

conditions or psychological disabilities, and those living with, at risk  of or affected 

by communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and cholera, and 

non-communicable and other diseases, will have a better quality of life and 

well-being, and in this regard taking note of the joint United Nations statement on 

ending discrimination in health-care settings,  

 Reiterating the importance of the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition 

(2016–2025), and its call for, inter alia, the scaling up of implementation of national 

commitments and increasing investments for nutrition,  

 Welcoming the United Nations Decade of Family Farming (2019–2028), and in 

this regard encouraging the full implementation of its resolution 72/239 of 

20 December 2017, in which it recognized the role that family farms play in 

improving nutrition and ensuring global food security, eradicating poverty, ending 

hunger, conserving biodiversity, achieving environmental sustainability and helping 

to address migration,  

 Recalling the World Health Organization Comprehensive Implementation Plan 

on Maternal, Infant and Young Child Nutrition12 and the World Health Organization 

Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases 

2013–2020,13  

 Taking note of the work of the Committee on World Food Security on preparing 

the draft voluntary guidelines on food systems and nutrition of the Committee, in 

support of the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016–2025), based on 

the twelfth report of the High Level Panel of Experts on Nutrition and Food Systems 

of the Committee,  

 Acknowledging the convening of Nutrition for Growth events in Rio de Janeiro, 

Brazil, in 2016 and in Milan, Italy, in 2017, and the Partners’ Forum 2018 in New 

Delhi in December 2018, by the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health, 

and looking forward to the upcoming Nutrition for Growth summit in Tokyo in 2020,  

 Reaffirming the right to use, to the fullest extent, the provisions contained in the 

World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual 

Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), which provides flexibilities for the protection 

of public health and promotes access to medicines for all, in particular for developing 

countries, and the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health,

which recognizes that intellectual property protection is important for the development  

of new medicines and also recognizes the concerns about its effects on prices,  

 Recognizing that rapidly changing technologies, particularly digital 

technologies, have the potential to enhance people’s access to health services, to 

improve the responsiveness of the health system to the needs of individuals and 

communities, to increase the quality and efficiency of health services and to empower 

individuals and communities in healthy lifestyles and practices,  

 Emphasizing that the United Nations system has an important responsibility and 

role to assist Member States in the follow-up to and full implementation of 

agreements and commitments reached at the major United Nations conferences and 

summits, especially those focusing on health-related areas, and emphasizing also the 

primary role of the World Health Organization, as the United Nations specialized 

agency for health,  

 Recognizing the need for a strong global partnership for sustainable 

development, which engages all stakeholders, including the private sector, civil
