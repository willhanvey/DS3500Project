  Russian Federation and United States of America: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Noting with concern that the situation in the Middle East is tense and is likely 

to remain so, unless and until a comprehensive settlement covering all aspects  of the 

Middle East problem can be reached, 

 Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations 

Disengagement Observer Force of 10 June 2014 (S/2014/401), and also reaffirming 

its resolution 1308 (2000) of 17 July 2000, 

 Stressing that both parties must abide by the terms of the 1974 Disengagement 

of Forces Agreement between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic and scrupulously 

observe the ceasefire, 

 Concurring with the Secretary-General’s findings that the ongoing military 

activities conducted by any actor in the area of separation continue to have the 

potential to escalate tensions between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic, 

jeopardize the ceasefire between the two countries, and pose a risk to the local 

civilian population and United Nations personnel on the ground,  

 Expressing grave concern at all violations of the Disengagement of Forces 

Agreement, 

 Stressing that there should be no military forces in the area of separation other 

than those of UNDOF, 

 Strongly condemning the recent intense fighting in the area of separation and 

calling on all parties to the Syrian domestic conflict to cease military actions in the 

UNDOF area of operation, and further condemning the increased use by elements of 

the Syrian opposition and other groups of improvised explosive devices in the 

UNDOF area of operation, 

 Condemning the use of heavy weapons by both the Syrian armed forces and 

armed members of the opposition in the ongoing Syrian conflict in the area of 

separation, including the use of tanks by the Syrian armed forces and opposition 

during clashes, 

 Also condemning the horrific crimes committed by some armed members of 

the opposition and calling upon all parties to the ongoing conflict to respect 

international humanitarian law,

cease military actions throughout the country, including in the UNDOF area of 

operation, 

 Strongly condemning the incidents threatening the safety and security of 

United Nations personnel in recent months,  

 Underscoring the need for UNDOF to have at its disposal all necessary means 

and resources to carry out its mandate safely and securely, and recalling that the 

theft of United Nations weapons and ammunition, vehicles and other assets, and the 

looting and destruction of United Nations facilities, are unacceptable,  

 Expressing its profound appreciation to UNDOF’s military and civilian 

personnel, including those from Observer Group Golan, for their service and 

continued contribution, in an increasingly challenging operating environment, 

underscoring the important contribution UNDOF’s continued presence makes to 

peace and security in the Middle East, welcoming steps taken to enhance the safety 

and security of UNDOF, including Observer Group Golan, personnel, and stressing 

the need for continued vigilance to ensure the safety and security of UNDOF and 

Observer Group Golan personnel,

Forces;

opposition groups in the area of separation, and urges Member States to convey 

strongly to the Syrian armed opposition groups in UNDOF’s area  of operation to

accord the United Nations personnel on the ground the freedom to carry out their 

mandate safely and securely; 

 4. Calls on all parties to cooperate fully with the operations of UNDOF, to 

respect its privileges and immunities and to ensure its freedom of movement, as well
