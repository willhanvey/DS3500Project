Saint Vincent and the Grenadines: draft resolution  
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 Reaffirming General Assembly and Security Council resolutions 70/262 and 

2282 (2016) of 27 April 2016, as well as A/RES/60/180 and S/RES/1645 (2005) of 

20 December 2005, A/RES/65/7 and S/RES/1947 (2010) of 29 October 2010, and 

A/RES/72/276 and S/RES/2413 (2018) of 26 April 2018, and recalling statements of 

the President of the Security Council of 28 July 2016, 21 December 2017, and 

18 December 2018,  

 Reaffirming that development, peace and security, and human rights are 

interlinked and mutually reinforcing,  

 Reaffirming that ‘sustaining peace’ should be broadly understood as a goal and 

a process to build a common vision of a society, ensuring that the needs of all 

segments of the population are taken into account, which encompasses activities 

aimed at preventing the outbreak, escalation, continuation and recurrence of conflict, 

addressing root causes, assisting parties to conflict to end hostilities, ensuring 

national reconciliation, and moving towards recovery, reconstruction and 

development, and emphasizing that sustaining peace is a shared task and 

responsibility that needs to be fulfilled by the government and all other national 

stakeholders, and should flow through all three pillars of the United Nations ’ 

engagement at all stages of conflict, and in all its dimensions, and needs sustained 

international attention and assistance,  

 Reaffirming the primary responsibility of national Governments and authorities 

in identifying, driving and directing priorities, strategies and activities for 

peacebuilding and sustaining peace, and in this regard, emphasizing that inclusivity 

is key to advancing national peacebuilding processes and objectives in order to ensure 

that the needs of all segments of society are taken into account,  

 Noting that this year marks the twentieth anniversary of Security Council 

resolution 1325 (2000) on Women, Peace and Security, and the fifth anniversaries of 

Security council resolution 2250 (2015) on Youth, peace and security, and recognising

Sustainable Development”,

need for full implementation of Security Council resolution 2532 (2020) and noting 

the relevant provisions of General Assembly resolution A/RES/74/306 in this regard, 

further noting that 2020 inaugurates the decade of action on the SDGs, recognizing 

that progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and 

all its goals and targets could be hampered, and peacebuilding and development gains 

reversed, and emphasizing the need to integrate peacebuilding and sustaining peace 

into efforts to build back better,  

 Welcoming the presentation of the report of the Secretary-General on 

peacebuilding and sustaining peace,1 and the valuable inputs for the 2020 review of 

the peacebuilding architecture of the Peacebuilding Commission through its letter 

dated 2 July 2020, of the group of Independent Eminent Persons through its letters 

dated 6 July 2020, and noting input from thematic and regional consultations, and 

encouraging relevant United Nations bodies and organs including the Peacebuilding 

Commission to consider the inputs further,  

 1. Welcomes the progress made in the implementation of the resolutions on 

peacebuilding and sustaining peace by Member States, including through the relevant 

intergovernmental bodies of the United Nations, and by the entire United Nations 

system, including through the reforms of the United Nations, and in particular at the 

field level through the work of peacekeeping operations, special political missions 

and UN country teams, and the important work of the Peacebuilding Fund, and 

encourages Member States and the entire United Nations system, in partnership with 

relevant stakeholders, including regional and sub-regional organizations, 

international financial institutions, civil society organizations, local peacebuilding 

stakeholders and, where relevant, the private sector, to continue to take action to 

implement the resolutions on peacebuilding and sustaining peace, and to advance 

efforts to bring greater coherence to peacebuilding efforts, in support of national 

peacebuilding priorities, and in particular in conflict-affected countries;  

 2. Welcomes in particular the important role of the Peacebuilding 

Commission, and calls on the Commission to continue strengthening its advisory, 

bridging and convening roles in support of nationally-owned priorities and efforts in 

the countries and regions under its consideration, as well as to continue strengthenin g 

its working methods to enhance its efficiency and impact in support of peacebuilding 

and sustaining peace; 

 3. Reaffirms that effective peacebuilding must involve the entire United 

Nations system, and in this regard, emphasizes the importance of joint an alysis and 

effective strategic planning in its long-term engagement in conflict-affected 

countries;  

 4. Notes that peacebuilding financing remains a critical challenge, and 

therefore takes note of the General Assembly decision to convene a high-level 

meeting in the seventy-sixth session to advance, explore and consider options for 

ensuring adequate, predictable and sustained financing for peacebuilding, and to 

invite, starting in the seventy-fifth session, the relevant United Nations bodies and 

organs, including the Peacebuilding Commission, in accordance with respective 

mandates, to present inputs in advance for Member States’ consideration and 

discussion at this meeting, and to affirm a commitment to pursuing action -oriented 

outcomes;  

 5. Calls for a further comprehensive review of United Nations peacebuilding 

in 2025, and requests the Secretary-General to present to the General Assembly and 

the Security Council an interim report in 2022 and a second, detailed report in 2024 

in advance of the review, and also requests the Secretary-General to continue to
