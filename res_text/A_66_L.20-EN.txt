 The General Assembly, 

 Having considered the item entitled “The situation in the Middle East”, 

 Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General,1 

 Recalling Security Council resolution 497 (1981) of 17 December 1981, 

 Reaffirming the fundamental principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition 
of territory by force, in accordance with international law and the Charter of the 
United Nations, 

 Reaffirming once more the applicability of the Geneva Convention relative to 
the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949,2 to the 
occupied Syrian Golan, 

 Deeply concerned that Israel has not withdrawn from the Syrian Golan, which 
has been under occupation since 1967, contrary to the relevant Security Council and 
General Assembly resolutions, 

 Stressing the illegality of the Israeli settlement construction and other activities 
in the occupied Syrian Golan since 1967, 

 Noting with satisfaction the convening in Madrid on 30 October 1991 of the 
Peace Conference on the Middle East, on the basis of Security Council resolutions

242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, 338 (1973) of 22 October 1973 and 425 (1978) of 
19 March 1978 and the formula of land for peace, 

 Expressing grave concern over the halt in the peace process on the Syrian 
track, and expressing the hope that peace talks will soon resume from the point they 
had reached, 

 1. Declares that Israel has failed so far to comply with Security Council 
resolution 497 (1981); 

 2. Also declares that the Israeli decision of 14 December 1981 to impose its 
laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan is null and void 
and has no validity whatsoever, as confirmed by the Security Council in its 
resolution 497 (1981), and calls upon Israel to rescind it; 

 3. Reaffirms its determination that all relevant provisions of the Regulations 
annexed to the Hague Convention of 1907,3 and the Geneva Convention relative to 
the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War,2 continue to apply to the Syrian 
territory occupied by Israel since 1967, and calls upon the parties thereto to respect 
and ensure respect for their obligations under those instruments in all circumstances; 

 4. Determines once more that the continued occupation of the Syrian Golan 
and its de facto annexation constitute a stumbling block in the way of achieving a 
just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region; 

 5. Calls upon Israel to resume the talks on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks 
and to respect the commitments and undertakings reached during the previous talks; 

 6. Demands once more that Israel withdraw from all the occupied Syrian 
Golan to the line of 4 June 1967 in implementation of the relevant Security Council 
resolutions; 

 7. Calls upon all the parties concerned, the co-sponsors of the peace process 
and the entire international community to exert all the necessary efforts to ensure 
the resumption of the peace process and its success by implementing Security 
Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973); 

 8. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its 
sixty-seventh session on the implementation of the present resolution.
