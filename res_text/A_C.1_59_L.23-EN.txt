Bearing in mind that challenges to the Treaty and to the nuclear non-
proliferation regime have further increased the necessity of full compliance and that
the Treaty can fulfil its role only if there is confidence in compliance by all States
parties,

Recognizing the progress made by the nuclear-weapon States in the reduction
of their nuclear weapons unilaterally or through their negotiations, including the
entry into force of the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Reductions between the
Russian Federation and the United States of America,2 which should serve as a step
for further nuclear disarmament, and the efforts for nuclear disarmament and non-
proliferation by the international community,

Welcoming the ongoing efforts aimed at the reduction of nuclear weapons
related materials deployed within the framework of international cooperation, such
as the Cooperative Threat Reduction programme,

Reaffirming the conviction that further advancement in nuclear disarmament
will contribute to consolidating the international regime for nuclear non-
proliferation, ensuring international peace and security,

Welcoming the continuation of a moratorium on nuclear-weapon-test
explosions or any other nuclear explosions since the last nuclear tests, in 1998,

Welcoming also the successful adoption of the Final Document of the 2000
Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons,3 and stressing the importance of implementing its conclusions,

7 May 2004, of the Preparatory Committee for the Review Conference of the Parties
to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to be held in 2005, and
emphasizing the importance of a successful Review Conference in 2005, the year of
the sixtieth anniversary of the atomic bombings,

Welcoming the steady increase in the number of States that have signed and/or
concluded additional protocols to their International Atomic Energy Agency
safeguards agreements in recent years, and sharing the hope that the International
Atomic Energy Agency safeguards system will be further strengthened through the
universalization of safeguards agreements and the additional protocols,

Encouraging the Russian Federation and the United States of America to
implement fully the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Reductions and to continue their
intensive consultations in accordance with the Joint Declaration on the New
Strategic Relationship between both States,2

Welcoming the Final Declaration of the third Conference on Facilitating the
Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, convened in

Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in September 2004,

developing nuclear weapons or related materials, radioactive materials, equipment

explosions pending the entry into force of that Treaty;

(b) The establishment of an ad hoc committee in the Conference on
Disarmament as early as possible during its 2005 session to negotiate a non-
discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty
banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear
explosive devices, in accordance with the report of the Special Coordinator of 19957
and the mandate contained therein, taking into consideration both nuclear
disarmament and non-proliferation objectives, with a view to its conclusion within
five years and, pending its entry into force, a moratorium on the production of
fissile material for nuclear weapons;

(c) The establishment of an appropriate subsidiary body with a mandate to
deal with nuclear disarmament in the Conference on Disarmament as early as
possible during its 2005 session in the context of establishing a programme of work;
