 Welcoming the convening of the Open-ended Working Group established by 
the General Assembly in its resolution 67/56 of 3 December 2012 to develop 
proposals to take forward multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations for the 
achievement and maintenance of a world without nuclear weapons, and 
acknowledging its final report,2 

 Underlining the importance of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation 
education, 

 Reaffirming that nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are 
mutually reinforcing processes requiring urgent irreversible progress on both fronts, 

 Recalling the decisions and the resolution adopted at the 1995 Review and 
Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons,3 the basis upon which the Treaty was indefinitely extended, and 
the Final Document of the 20004 and the 20105 Review Conference of the Parties to 
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and in particular the 
unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon States to accomplish the total 
elimination of their nuclear arsenals, leading to nuclear disarmament, in accordance 
with commitments made under article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons,6 

 Reaffirming the commitment of all States parties to the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to apply the principles of irreversibility, 
verifiability and transparency in relation to the implementation of their treaty 
obligations, 

 Recalling that the 2010 Review Conference reaffirmed and recognized that the 
total elimination of nuclear weapons is the only absolute guarantee against the use 
or threat of use of nuclear weapons and the legitimate interest of non-nuclear-
weapon States in receiving unequivocal and legally binding negative security 
assurances from nuclear-weapon States pending the total elimination of nuclear 
weapons, 

 Recognizing the continued vital importance of the entry into force of the 
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty7 to the advancement of nuclear 
disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation objectives, and welcoming the recent 
ratifications of the Treaty by Brunei Darussalam, Chad, Guinea-Bissau and Iraq,  

 Reaffirming the conviction that, pending the total elimination of nuclear 
weapons, the establishment and maintenance of nuclear-weapon-free zones 
enhances global and regional peace and security, strengthens the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime and contributes towards realizing the objectives of nuclear 
disarmament, urging further concrete progress towards strengthening all existing 
nuclear-weapon-free zones, including through the withdrawal of any reservations or

interpretative declarations contrary to the object and purpose of the treaties 
establishing these zones, recognizing the second preparatory meeting for the Third 
Conference of States Parties and Signatories of Treaties that Establish 
Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones and Mongolia, held in Geneva on 26 April 2013, and 
welcoming the announcement by Indonesia of its intention to host the Third 
Conference in 2015,  

 Recalling the encouragement expressed at the 2010 Review Conference for the 
establishment of further nuclear-weapon-free zones, on the basis of arrangements 
freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned, reaffirming the 
expectation that this will be followed by concerted international efforts to create 
such zones in areas where they do not currently exist, especially in the Middle East, 
and in that context recognizing the agreement at the 2010 Review Conference on 
practical steps to fully implement the 1995 resolution on the Middle East, 

 Acknowledging the ongoing efforts towards the full implementation of the 
Treaty between the Russian Federation and the United States of America on 
Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, 
while re-emphasizing the encouragement of the 2010 Review Conference to both 
States to continue discussions on follow-on measures in order to achieve deeper 
reductions in their nuclear arsenals,  

 Deeply disappointed at the continued absence of progress towards multilateral 
negotiations on nuclear disarmament issues, in particular in the Conference on 
Disarmament, despite intensive efforts during its 2013 session to agree on a 
programme of work, and underlining the importance of multilateralism in relation to 
nuclear disarmament, while recognizing also the value of bilateral and regional 
initiatives,  

 Acknowledging the second session of the Preparatory Committee for the 
2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons, held in Geneva from 22 April to 3 May 2013, and emphasizing 
the importance of a constructive and successful preparatory process leading to the 
2015 Review Conference, which should contribute to strengthening the Treaty and 
making progress towards achieving its full implementation and universality, and 
monitor the implementation of commitments made and actions agreed at the 1995, 
2000 and 2010 Review Conferences, 

 1. Reiterates that each article of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons6 is binding on the States parties at all times and in all 
circumstances and that all States parties should be held fully accountable with 
respect to strict compliance with their obligations under the Treaty, and calls upon 
all States parties to comply fully with all decisions, resolutions and commitments 
made at the 1995, 2000 and 2010 Review Conferences;  

 2. Reiterates the deep concern expressed by the 2010 Review Conference at 
the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons, and the 
need for all States at all times to comply with applicable international law, including 
international humanitarian law; 

 3. Recalls the reaffirmation of the continued validity of the practical steps 
agreed to in the final document of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the

13-51674 4/5 
 

Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,8 including the specific 
reaffirmation of the unequivocal undertaking of the nuclear-weapon States to 
accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear 
disarmament, to which all States parties are committed under article VI of the 
Treaty, recalls the commitment of the nuclear-weapon States to accelerate concrete 
progress on the steps leading to nuclear disarmament as envisaged in action 5 of the 
action plan on nuclear disarmament of the Final Document of the 2010 Review 
Conference,1 and calls upon the nuclear-weapon States to take all necessary steps to 
accelerate the fulfilment of their commitments, including the requirement to report 
to the Preparatory Committee in 2014; 

 4. Calls upon nuclear-weapon States to fulfil their commitment to undertake 
further efforts to reduce and ultimately eliminate all types of nuclear weapons, 
deployed and non-deployed, including through unilateral, bilateral, regional and 
multilateral measures;  

 5. Underlines the recognition by the 2010 Review Conference of the 
legitimate interests of non-nuclear-weapon States in the constraining by the nuclear-

and their ending the development of advanced new types of nuclear weapons, and 
calls upon the nuclear-weapon States to take steps in this regard; 

 6. Encourages further steps by all nuclear-weapon States, in accordance 
with the action plan on nuclear disarmament of the Final Document of the 
2010 Review Conference, to ensure the irreversible removal of all fissile material 
designated by each nuclear-weapon State as no longer required for military 
purposes, and calls upon all States to support, within the context of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, the development of appropriate nuclear disarmament 
verification capabilities and legally binding verification arrangements, thereby 
ensuring that such material remains permanently outside military programmes in a 
verifiable manner; 

 7. Calls upon all States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons to work towards the full implementation of the resolution on the 
Middle East adopted at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference,3 and recognizes 
the endorsement by the 2010 Review Conference of practical steps in a process 
leading to the full implementation of the 1995 resolution, including the convening 
of a conference in 2012 to be attended by all States of the region on the 
establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons 
of mass destruction;  

 8. Expresses its profound disappointment at the failure to convene a 
conference in 2012 on the establishment in the Middle East of a zone free of nuclear 
weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction, and calls upon the Secretary-
General and the co-sponsors of the 1995 resolution to convene the conference 
without any further delay;  

 9. Continues to emphasize the fundamental role of the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in achieving nuclear disarmament and 
nuclear non-proliferation, and calls upon all States parties to spare no effort to

States;  

 13. Welcomes the announcements made by some nuclear-weapon States 
providing information about their nuclear arsenals, policies and disarmament 
efforts, and urges those nuclear-weapon States that have not yet done so also to 
provide this information, which would build increased confidence and trust and 
would contribute to sustainable disarmament;  

 14. Calls upon all States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
