25 November 2015 (S/PRST/2015/22) and 31 December 2015 (S/PRST/2015/26), as 

well as its resolution 2242 (2015) and press statement of 18 August 2015,  

 Reaffirming that proper conduct by, and discipline over, all personnel deployed

 Stressing that sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations peacekeepers 

undermines the implementation of peacekeeping mandates, as well as the credibility 

of United Nations peacekeeping, and reaffirming its support for the United Nations 

zero tolerance policy on all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse,  

 Expressing deep concern about the serious and continuous allegations and 

under-reporting of sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations peacekeepers 

and non-United Nations forces, including military, civilian and police personnel, 

and underscoring that sexual exploitation and abuse, among other crimes and forms 

of serious misconduct, by any such personnel is unacceptable,  

 Recalling the primary responsibility of troop-contributing countries to 

investigate allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse by their personnel and of 

troop- and police-contributing countries to hold accountable, including through 

prosecution, where appropriate, their personnel for acts of sexual exploitation and 

abuse, taking into account due process,  

 Honouring the heroic work of tens of thousands of United Nations 

peacekeepers, underscoring that the United Nations should not let the actions of a 

few tarnish the achievements of the whole and commending the troop- and police-

contributing countries that have taken steps to prevent, investigate and hold 

accountable their personnel for acts of sexual exploitation and abuse,  

 Welcoming the Secretary-General’s continued efforts to implement and 

reinforce the United Nations zero tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse, 

in particular to strengthen the Organisation’s prevention, reporting, enforcement and 

remedial action in order to promote greater accountability,
