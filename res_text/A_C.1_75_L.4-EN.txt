 Confirming that information and communications technologies are dual-use 

technologies and can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes,  

 Stressing that it is in the interest of all States to promote the use of information 

and communications technologies for peaceful purposes and to prevent conflict 

arising from the use of information and communications technologies,  

 Expressing concern that these technologies and means can potentially be used 

for purposes that are inconsistent with the objectives of maintaining international 

stability and security and may adversely affect the integrity of the infr astructure of 

States, to the detriment of their security in both civil and military fields,  

 Underscoring the need for enhanced coordination and cooperation among States 

in combating the criminal misuse of information technologies,  

 Underlining the importance of respect for human rights and fundamental 

freedoms in the use of information and communications technologies,  

 Welcoming the effective work of the Group of Governmental Experts on 

Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of 

International Security and the 2010,1 20132 and 20153 reports transmitted by the 

Secretary-General,  

 Stressing the importance of the assessments and recommendations contained in 

the reports of the Group of Governmental Experts,  

 Confirming the conclusions of the Group of Governmental Experts, in its 2013 and 

2015 reports, that international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, 

is applicable and essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, 

secure, stable, accessible and peaceful information and communications technology 

environment, that voluntary and non-binding norms, rules and principles of responsible 

behaviour of States in the use of information and communications technologies can 

reduce risks to international peace, security and stability, and that, given the unique 

attributes of such technologies, additional norms can be developed over time,  

 Confirming also the conclusions of the Group of Governmental Experts that 

voluntary confidence-building measures can promote trust and assurance among 

States and help to reduce the risk of conflict by increasing predictability and reducing 

misperception and thereby make an important contribution to addressing the concerns 

of States over the use of information and communications technologies by States and 

could be a significant step towards greater international security,  

 Confirming further the conclusions of the Group of Governmental Experts that 

providing assistance to build capacity in the area of information and communications 

technology security is also essential for international security, by improving the 

capacity of States for cooperation and collective action and promoting the use of such 

technologies for peaceful purposes,  

 Stressing that, while States have a primary responsibility for maintaining a 

secure and peaceful information and communications technology environment, 

effective international cooperation would benefit from identifying mechanisms for 

the participation, as appropriate, of the private sector, academia and civil society 

organizations, 

 Noting the productive, useful and ongoing discussions within the Open-Ended 

Working Group, which is inclusive of all Member States, and the Group of
