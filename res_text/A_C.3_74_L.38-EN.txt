standards of life in larger freedom, to practise tolerance and good-neighbourliness 

and to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social 

advancement of all peoples, 

 Stressing that the responsibility for managing worldwide economic and social 

issues, as well as threats to international peace and security, must be shared among 

the nations of the world and should be exercised multilaterally, and that in this regard 

the central role must be played by the United Nations, as the most universal and 

representative organization in the world,  

 Concerned about the continued abuse by Member States of the extraterritorial 

application of their national legislation in a manner that affects the sovereignty of 

other States, the legitimate interests of entities or persons under their jurisdiction and 

the full enjoyment of human rights,  

 Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the 

aspirations of all peoples for an international order based on the principles enshrined 

in the Charter, including promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and 

fundamental freedoms for all and respect for the principle of equal rights and 

self-determination of peoples, peace, democracy, justice, equality, the rule of law,

democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own 

political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in all 

aspects of their lives, 

 Recognizing that the promotion and protection of human rights should be based 

on the principle of cooperation and genuine dialogue and aimed at strengthening the 

capacity of Member States to comply with their human rights obligations for the 

benefit of all human beings,

 Recognizing that democracy, respect for all human rights, including the right to 

development, transparent and accountable governance and administration in all 

sectors of society and effective participation by civil society are an essential part of 

the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people -centred sustainable

contribute greatly to the enhancement of international cooperation at all levels,

crises, resulting from a combination of several major factors, including 

macroeconomic and other factors, such as environmental degradation, desertifi cation 

and global climate change, natural disasters and the lack of financial resources and 

the technology necessary to confront their negative impact in developing countries, 

particularly in the least developed countries and small island developing States , 

represent a global scenario that is threatening the adequate enjoyment of all human 

rights and widening the gap between developed and developing countries,  

 Recognizing that a democratic and equitable order requires the reform of 

international financial institutions, in order to widen and strengthen the level of 

participation of developing countries in the international decision-making process, and 

a more transparent and open financial system, as well as adequate measures against illicit 

financial flows, such as tax fraud, tax evasion, illegal capital flight, money-laundering 

and the proceeds of corruption, and for improving tax transparency worldwide,  

 Stressing that efforts to make globalization fully inclusive and equitable must 

include policies and measures at the global level that correspond to the needs of 

developing countries and countries with economies in transition and are formulated 

and implemented with their effective participation,  

 Stressing also the need for adequate financing of, technology transfer to and 

capacity-building in developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, 

landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, including to 

support their efforts to adapt to climate change,  

 Having listened to the peoples of the world, and recognizing their aspirations to 

justice, to equality of opportunity for all, to the enjoyment of their human rights, 

including the right to development, to live in peace and freedom and to equal 

participation without discrimination in economic, social, cultural, civil and political life, 

 Recalling Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the 

Council and 5/2 on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate Holders of 

the Council of 18 June 2007,7 and stressing that all mandate holders shall discharge 

their duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto,  

 Emphasizing the importance of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 8 

for the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order,
