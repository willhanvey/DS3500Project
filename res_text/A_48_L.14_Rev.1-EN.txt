NECESSITY OF ENDING THE ECONOMIC, COMMERCIAL AND
FINANCIAL EMBARGO IMPOSED BY THE UNITED STATES OF

AMERICA AGAINST CUBA

Cuba: revised draft resolution

The General Assembly,

Determined to encourage strict compliance with the purposes and principles
enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations,

Reaffirming, among other principles, the sovereign equality of States,
non-intervention and non-interference in their internal affairs and freedom of
trade and international navigation, which are also enshrined in many
international legal instruments,

Taking note of the statement of the Heads of State and Government at the
third Ibero-American Summit, held in Salvador, Brazil, in July 1993, concerning
the need to eliminate the unilateral application of economic and trade measures
by one State against another for political purposes,

Concerned about the continued promulgation and application by Member States
of laws and regulations whose extraterritorial effects affect the sovereignty of
other States and the legitimate interests of entities or persons under their
jurisdiction, as well as the freedom of trade and navigation,

Recalling its resolution 47/19 of 24 November 1992,

Having learned that, since the adoption of resolution 47/19, further
measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic,
commercial and financial embargo against Cuba have been promulgated and applied,
and concerned about the adverse effects of those measures on the Cuban
population,

trade and navigation;

3. Once again urges States that have such laws or measures to take the
necessary steps to repeal or invalidate them as soon as possible in accordance
with their legal regime;

4. Requests the Secretary-General, in consultation with the appropriate
organs and agencies of the United Nations system, to prepare a report on the
implementation of the present resolution in the light of the purposes and
principles of the Charter and international law, and to submit it to the General
Assembly at its forty-ninth session;

5. Decides to include the item in the provisional agenda of its
forty-ninth session.
