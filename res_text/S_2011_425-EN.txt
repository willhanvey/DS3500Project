 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming its resolutions 1261 (1999) of 25 August 1999, 1314 (2000) of 
11 August 2000, 1379 (2001) of 20 November 2001, 1460 (2003) of 30 January 
2003, 1539 (2004) of 22 April 2004, 1612 (2005) of 26 July 2005, and 1882 (2009) 
of 4 August 2009, and all relevant Statements of its President, which contribute to a 
comprehensive framework for addressing the protection of children affected by 
armed conflict; 

 Reiterating its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international 
peace and security and, in this connection, its commitment to address the 
widespread impact of armed conflict on children;  

 Calling on all parties to armed conflicts to comply strictly with the obligations 
applicable to them under international law for the protection of children in armed 
conflict, including those contained in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and 
its Optional Protocol on the involvement of Children in armed conflict, as well as 
the Geneva Conventions of 12th August 1949 and their Additional Protocols of 
1977;  

 Acknowledging that the implementation of its resolutions 1612 (2005) and 
1882 (2009) has generated progress, resulting in the release and reintegration of 
children into their families and communities, and in a more systematic dialogue 
with the United Nations country-level task force and parties to the armed conflict on 
the implementation on time-bound action plans, while remaining deeply concerned 
over the lack of progress on the ground in some situations of concern where parties 
to conflict continue to violate with impunity the relevant provisions of applicable 
international law relating to the rights and protection of children in armed conflict;  



S/2011/425  
 

11-41112 2 
 

 Stressing the primary role of Governments in providing protection and relief to 
all children affected by armed conflict, and reiterating that all actions undertaken by 
United Nations entities within the framework of the monitoring and reporting 
mechanism must be designed to support and supplement, as appropriate, the 
protection and rehabilitation roles of national Governments;  

 Convinced that the protection of children in armed conflict should be an 
important aspect of any comprehensive strategy to resolve conflict;  

 Recalling the responsibilities of States to end impunity and to prosecute those 
responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other egregious 
crimes perpetrated against children; 

 Stressing the need for alleged perpetrators of crimes against children in 
situations of armed conflict to be brought to justice through national justice systems 
and, where applicable, international justice mechanisms and mixed criminal courts 
and tribunals in order to end impunity; 

 Noting also relevant provisions of the Rome Statute of the International 
Criminal Court; 

 Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 11 May 2011 
(A/65/820-S/2011/250) and stressing that the present resolution does not seek to 
make any legal determination as to whether situations which are referred to in the 
Secretary-General’s report are or are not armed conflicts within the context of the 
Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocols thereto, nor does it prejudge the 
legal status of the non-State parties involved in these situations; 

 Expressing deep concern about attacks as well as threats of attacks in 
contravention of applicable international law against schools and/or hospitals, and 
protected persons in relation to them as well as the closure of schools and hospitals 
in situations of armed conflict as a result of attacks and threats of attacks, and 
calling upon all parties to armed conflict to immediately cease such attacks and 
threats;  

 Recalling the provisions of the resolution of the General Assembly on “The 
right to education in emergency situations” (A/RES/64/290) related to children in 
armed conflict; 

 Noting that Article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes 
the right of the child to education and sets forth obligations for State parties to the 
Convention, with a view to progressively achieving this right on the basis of equal 
opportunity;  

 1. Strongly condemns all violations of applicable international law 
involving the recruitment and use of children by parties to armed conflict, as well as 
their re-recruitment, killing and maiming, rape and other sexual violence, 
abductions, attacks against schools or hospitals and denial of humanitarian access by 
parties to armed conflict and all other violations of international law committed 
against children in situations of armed conflict;  

 2. Reaffirms that the monitoring and reporting mechanism will continue to 
be implemented in situations listed in annex I and annex II (“the annexes”) to the 
reports of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict, in line with the 
principles set out in paragraph 2 of its resolution 1612 (2005), and that its 



 S/2011/425
 

3 11-41112 
 

establishment and implementation shall not prejudge or imply a decision by the 
Security Council as to whether or not to include a situation on its agenda;  

 3. Recalls paragraph 16 of its resolution 1379 (2001) and requests the 
Secretary-General to also include in the annexes to his reports on children and

relation to schools and/or hospitals in situations of armed conflict, bearing in mind

in paragraph 16 of its resolution 1379 (2001); 

 4. Urges parties to armed conflict to refrain from actions that impede 
children’s access to education and to health services and requests the Secretary-

and hospitals in contravention of international humanitarian law, as well as on 
attacks against, and/or kidnapping of teachers and medical personnel; 

 5. Invites the Secretary General, through the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, to exchange appropriate 
information and maintain interaction from the earliest opportunity with the 
governments concerned regarding violations and abuses committed against children 
by parties which may be included in the annexes to his periodic report; 

 6. While noting that some parties to armed conflict have responded to its 
call upon them to prepare and implement concrete time-bound action plans to halt 
recruitment and use of children in violation of applicable international law; 

 (a) Reiterates its call on parties to armed conflict listed in the annexes of the 
Secretary-General’s report on children and armed conflict that have not already

applicable international law, as well as rape and other sexual violence against 
children;

persons in relation to schools and/or hospitals, in violation of applicable 
international law, as well as rape and other sexual violence against children;

report on children and armed conflict that commit, in contravention of applicable

 7. In this context, encourages Member States to devise ways, in close 
consultations with the United Nations country-level task force on monitoring and

implementation of time-bound actions plans, and the review and monitoring by the 
United Nations country level task force of obligations and commitments relating to 
the protection of children and armed conflict;
