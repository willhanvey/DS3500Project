in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small,  

 Reaffirming that everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which 

the rights and freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 7 can 

be fully realized, 

 Reaffirming also the determination expressed in the Preamble to the Charter to 

save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, to establish conditions under

standards of life in larger freedom, to practise tolerance and good-neighbourliness 

and to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social 

advancement of all peoples,

issues, including pandemics and other health-related global challenges, as well as 

threats to international peace and security, must be shared among the nations of the 

world and should be exercised multilaterally, and that in this regard the central role 

must be played by the United Nations, as the most universal and representat ive 

organization in the world, 

 Concerned about the continued abuse by Member States of the extraterritorial 

application of their national legislation in a manner that affects the sovereignty of 

other States, the legitimate interests of entities or persons under their jurisdiction and

 Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the 

aspirations of all peoples for an international order based on the principles enshrined

economic and social dimensions,  

 Recognizing that democracy, respect for all human rights, including the right to 

development, transparent and accountable governance and administration in all 

sectors of society and effective participation by civil society are an essential part of 

the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable 

development,

intolerance may be aggravated by, inter alia, inequitable distribution of wealth, 

marginalization and social exclusion,

contribute greatly to the enhancement of international cooperation at all levels,

 Deeply concerned that the current global economic, financial, energy and food 

crises, resulting from a combination of several major factors, including 

macroeconomic and other factors, such as environmental degradation, desertification 

and global climate change, natural disasters and the lack of financial resources and 

the technology necessary to confront their negative impact in developing countries, 

particularly in the least developed countries and small island developing States, 

represent a global scenario that is threatening the adequate enjoyment of all human 

rights and widening the gap between developed and developing countries, 

 Recognizing that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is one of the 

greatest global challenges in the history of the United Nations, and noting with deep 

concern its impact on health and the loss of life, mental health and well-being, as well 

as the negative impact on global humanitarian needs, the enjoyment of human rights 

and across all spheres of society, including on livelihoods, food security and nutrition, 

and education, the exacerbation of poverty and hunger, disruption to economies, 

trade, societies and environments, and the exacerbation of economic and social

Development8 and all its Goals and targets,

its strong support for the central role of the United Nations system, recognizing the

COVID-19 pandemic, and recognizing also that a democratic and equitable 

international order enhances the capacities of all countries to respond to and recover 

from the pandemic and other global challenges, 

 Recognizing the role of extensive immunization against COVID-19 as a global 

public good for health in preventing, containing and stopping transmission in order 

to bring the pandemic to an end, through global access to vaccines that are safe, of 

quality, efficacious, effective and affordable for all countries, 

 Deeply concerned about the uneven access of developing countries to safe, 

quality, efficacious, effective and affordable vaccines against COVID-19, and

international order, enhances the capacities of all countries, in particular developing

international financial institutions, in order to widen and strengthen the level of 

participation of developing countries in the international decision-making process, 

and a more transparent and open financial system, as well as adequate measures  

against illicit financial flows, such as tax fraud, tax evasion, illegal capital flight, 

money-laundering and the proceeds of corruption, and for improving tax transparency 

worldwide,

include policies and measures at the global level that correspond to the needs of 

developing countries and countries with economies in transition and are formulated 

and implemented with their effective participation, 

 Stressing also the need for adequate financing of, technology transfer to and 

capacity-building in developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, 

landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, including to 

support their efforts to adapt to climate change, 

 Having listened to the peoples of the world, and recognizing their aspirations to 

justice, to equality of opportunity for all, to the enjoyment of their human rights,
