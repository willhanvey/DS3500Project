  Compliance with non-proliferation, arms limitation and 

disarmament agreements and commitments  
 

 

 The General Assembly,  

 Recalling its resolution 66/49 of 2 December 2011 and other relevant 

resolutions on the question,  

 Recognizing the abiding concern of all Member States for ensuring respect for 

the rights and obligations arising from treaties to which they are parties and from 

other sources of international law,  

 Convinced that observance by Member States of the Charter of the United 

Nations and compliance with non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament 

agreements to which they are parties and with other agreed obligations are essential 

for regional and global peace, security and stability,  

 Stressing that failure by States parties to comply with such agreements and 

with other agreed obligations not only adversely affects the security of States part ies 

but also can create security risks for other States relying on the constraints and 

commitments stipulated in those agreements,  



A/C.1/69/L.45 
 

 

14-62918 2/3 

 

 Stressing also that the viability and effectiveness of non-proliferation, arms 

limitation and disarmament agreements and of other agreed obligations require that 

those agreements be fully complied with and enforced,  

 Concerned by non-compliance by some States with their respective 

obligations,  

 Noting that verification and compliance, and enforcement in a manner 

consistent with the Charter, are integrally related,  

 Recognizing the importance of and support for effective national, regional and 

international capacities for such verification, compliance and enforcement,  

 Recognizing also that full compliance by States with all their respective 

non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament agreements and with other 

agreed obligations they have undertaken contributes to efforts to prevent the 

development and proliferation, contrary to international obligations, of weapons of  

mass destruction, related technologies and means of delivery, as well as to efforts to 

deny non-State actors access to such capabilities,  

 1. Underscores the contribution that compliance with non-proliferation, 

arms limitation and disarmament agreements and with other agreed obligations 

makes to enhancing confidence and to strengthening international security and 

stability;  

 2. Urges all States to implement and to comply fully with their respective 

obligations;  

 3. Welcomes efforts by all States to pursue additional areas of cooperation, 

as appropriate, that can increase confidence in compliance with existing 

non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament agreements and commitments 

and reduce the possibility of misinterpretation and misunderstanding;   

 4. Calls upon all Member States to encourage and, for those States in a 

position to do so, to appropriately assist States which request assistance to increase 

their capacity to implement fully their obligations;  

 5. Calls upon Member States to support efforts aimed at the resolution of 

compliance questions by means consistent with such agreements and with 

international law;  

 6. Welcomes the role that the United Nations has played and continues to 

play in maintaining the integrity of certain arms limita tion and disarmament and 

non-proliferation agreements and in addressing threats to international peace and 

security;  

 7. Calls upon all concerned States to take concerted action, in a manner 

consistent with relevant international law, to encourage, through bilateral and 

multilateral means, the compliance by all States with their respective 

non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament agreements and with other 

agreed obligations, and to hold those not in compliance with such agreements 

accountable for their non-compliance in a manner consistent with the Charter of the 

United Nations; 



 
A/C.1/69/L.45 

 

3/3 14-62918 

 

 8. Urges those States not currently in compliance with their respective 

obligations and commitments to make the strategic decision to come back into 

compliance;  

 9. Encourages efforts by all States, the United Nations and other 

international organizations, pursuant to their respective mandates, to take action, 

consistent with the Charter, to prevent serious damage to international security and 

stability arising from non-compliance by States with their existing non-proliferation, 

arms limitation and disarmament obligations;  

 10. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-second 

session, under the item entitled “General and complete disarmament”, the sub -item 

entitled “Compliance with non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament 

agreements and commitments”.
