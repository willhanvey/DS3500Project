  Annex 
Letter dated 7 December 2008 from the Prime Minister of Iraq addressed to the 
President of the Security Council 
 

 Further to our letter dated 31 December 2007 addressed to you, in which we 
indicated that the extension of the mandate of the Multinational Forces in Iraq 
(MNF I) would be for one final time; with appreciation for the important role and 
efforts of those forces in assisting Iraq to achieve security and stability; and in view 
of the fact that Iraq has signed the Agreement between the United States of America 



S/2008/805  
 

08-66611 4 
 

and the Republic of Iraq on the Withdrawal of United States Forces from Iraq and 
the Organization of their Activities during their Temporary Presence in Iraq, we look 
forward to the ending of the mandate of MNF-I at the end of 31 December 2008. On 
behalf of the Government and people of Iraq, I express my gratitude to the 
Governments of the States that have contributed to those forces and to the forces 
themselves for the services rendered during their presence in the territory, waters 
and airspace of Iraq. 

 Iraq has inherited debts and claims from the previous regime and has made 
great progress in settling them. However, much remains to be done, and our efforts 
to settle those claims and debts will require some time. Temporary support from the 
international community will continue to be required during the coming phase. 
Therefore, we hope that the international community will continue current 
protections and arrangements for petroleum, petroleum products, and natural gas 
from Iraq and the proceeds thereof until such time as the Government of Iraq is able 
to take the measures necessary to settle those debts and claims inherited from the 
previous regime. Oil revenues constitute 95 per cent of Government resources, and 
these claims have an impact on reconstruction and the economic transformations 
taking place in Iraq, and consequently pose a grave threat to Iraq’s stability and 
security and by extension to international peace and security. 

 The Iraqi Government recognizes the importance of the provisions of 
paragraph 22 of United Nations Security Council resolution 1483 (2003) ensuring 
that Iraq’s petroleum and natural gas resources and proceeds and obligations arising 
from sales thereof, as well as funds deposited in the Development Fund for Iraq, 
shall be used for reconstruction projects and other purposes benefiting the people of 
Iraq. Therefore, bearing in mind the exception provided for in paragraph 27 of 
United Nations Security Council resolution 1546 (2004), Iraq requests that the 
Security Council continue to implement the provisions of paragraph 22 of United 
Nations Security Council resolution 1483 (2003) until 31 December 2009, including 
those relating to funds or other financial assets or economic resources mentioned in 
paragraph 23 of that resolution. 

 The Government of Iraq believes that the provisions of United Nations 
Security Council resolution 1546 (2004) relating to the deposit of proceeds into the 
Development Fund for Iraq will help to ensure that proceeds from Iraq’s natural 
resources will be used for the benefit of the Iraqi people, as will the role played by 
the International Advisory and Monitoring Board. The Iraqi Government recognizes 
that the Development Fund for Iraq plays an important role in helping Iraq to 
reassure donors and creditors that Iraq is administering its resources and debts in a 
responsible manner in the service of the Iraqi people. It should be noted that Iraq is 
attempting, after years of isolation under the previous regime, to form a new 
partnership with the international community with a view to integrating its economy 
into those of the region and the world through the International Compact with Iraq, 
and its efforts were endorsed by more than 90 countries and international 
organizations in the Stockholm Declaration of 29 May 2008. In view of this, Iraq 
requests the Security Council to extend the mandates of the Development Fund for 
Iraq and the International Advisory and Monitoring Board for a period of 12 
months, with a review of the extension to be conducted before 15 June 2009 at the 
request of the Government of Iraq. 



 S/2008/805
 

5 08-66611 
 

 The Government of Iraq affirms that it honours its obligations under United 
Nations Security Council resolutions and follows policies of peaceful coexistence 
with its neighbours conducive to the security and stability of the region. The 
Government of Iraq looks forward to recognition by the United Nations Security 
Council that major positive developments have taken place in Iraq; that the situation 
in Iraq is fundamentally different from that prevailing at the time of the adoption of 
United Nations Security Council resolution 661 (1990); and that the time has come 
for Iraq to regain its legal and international status prevailing prior to the adoption by 
the Security Council of that resolution and the subsequent sanctions imposed on it 
under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. 

 The Government of Iraq requests that the Security Council include this letter 
as an annex to the resolution currently being drafted on Iraq, and should be grateful 
if the President of the Security Council would circulate it to the Members of the 
Security Council as soon as possible.

Prime Minister of the Republic of Iraq
