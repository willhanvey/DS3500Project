  Ethical imperatives for a nuclear-weapon-free world 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 75/73 of 7 December 2020, adopted on the occasion of 

the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, which was established to save 

succeeding generations from the untold suffering of the scourge of war, and its 

resolution 74/47 of 12 December 2019, 

 Recalling also that the United Nations emerged at the time of the immense trail 

of death and destruction resulting from the Second World War,  over 75 years ago, 

 Recalling further the noble principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 

which enjoin the international community, individually and collectively, to spare no 

effort in promoting the ethical imperative of “in larger freedom”, so that all peoples 

may enjoy freedom from want, freedom from fear and the freedom to live in dignity,  

 Convinced that, given the catastrophic humanitarian consequences and risks 

associated with a nuclear weapon detonation, Member States have long envisaged 

nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation as urgent and interlinked ethical 

imperatives in achieving the objectives of the Charter, which is reflected in the first 

resolution, resolution 1 (I), adopted by the General Assembly on 24 January 1946, 

aimed at the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other 

major weapons adaptable to mass destruction, 

 Acknowledging, in this connection, the ethical imperatives outlined in the 

provisions of its resolutions and reports and those of other related international 

initiatives on the catastrophic humanitarian consequences and risks posed by a 

nuclear weapon detonation, including the declaration that the use of nuclear weapons 

would cause indiscriminate suffering and as such is a violation of the Charter and the

A/C.1/76/L.4 
 

 

21-14082 2/3 

 

laws of humanity and international law,1 the condemnation of nuclear war as contrary 

to human conscience and a violation of the fundamental right to life, 2 the threat to the 

very survival of humankind posed by the existence of nuclear weapons, 3 the 

detrimental environmental effects of the use of nuclear weapons, 4 and the disquiet 

that was expressed at the continued spending on the development and maintenance of 

nuclear arsenals,5 

 Acknowledging also the preamble to and article VI of the Treaty on the 

Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons6 and the advisory opinion of the International 

Court of Justice on the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons, 7 in which the 

Court unanimously concluded that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith 

and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its 

aspects under strict and effective international control,  

 Acknowledging further the United Nations Millennium Declaration,8 in which 

Heads of State and Government resolved to strive for the elimination of weapons of 

mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, and to keep all options open for 

achieving that aim, including the possibility of convening an international conference 

to identify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers, 

 Concerned that, despite the long-standing recognition that it has accorded to 

these ethical imperatives and while much effort has been directed to addressing 

nuclear non-proliferation, limited progress has been made in meeting the nuclear 

disarmament obligations required to achieve and maintain the nuclear-weapon-free 

world that the international community demands,  

 Disappointed at the continued absence of progress towards multilateral 

negotiations on nuclear disarmament in the Conference on Disarmament, despite 

unrelenting efforts of Member States towards this end,  

 Noting with satisfaction the increasing awareness, renewed attention and 

growing momentum that has been generated by Member States and the international 

community since 2010 regarding the catastrophic humanitarian consequences and 

risks associated with nuclear weapons, which underpin the ethical imperatives for 

nuclear disarmament and the urgency of achieving and maintaining a nuclear-weapon-

free world, together with all related international initiatives, 

 Recalling the adoption on 7 July 2017 of the Treaty on the Prohibition of 

Nuclear Weapons,9 in which the ethical imperatives for nuclear disarmament are 

acknowledged, and welcoming its entry into force on 22 January 2021,  

 Conscious of the absolute validity of multilateral diplomacy in relation to 

nuclear disarmament, and determined to promote multilateralism as essential to 

nuclear disarmament negotiations,  

 1. Calls upon all States to acknowledge the catastrophic humanitarian 

consequences and risks posed by a nuclear weapon detonation, whether by accident, 

miscalculation or design;

 2. Acknowledges the ethical imperatives for nuclear disarmament and the 

urgency of achieving and maintaining a nuclear-weapon-free world, which is a 

“global public good of the highest order”, serving both national and collective 

security interests; 

 3. Declares that: 

 (a) The global threat posed by nuclear weapons must urgently be eliminated;  

 (b) Discussions, decisions and actions on nuclear weapons must focus on the 

effects of these weapons on human beings and the environment and must be guided 

by the unspeakable suffering and unacceptable harm that they cause;  

 (c) Greater attention must be given to the impact of a nuclear weapon 

detonation on women and the importance of their participation in discussions, 

decisions and actions on nuclear weapons;  

 (d) Nuclear weapons serve to undermine collective security, heighten the risk 

of nuclear catastrophe, aggravate international tension and make confli ct more 

dangerous; 

 (e) Arguments in favour of the retention of nuclear weapons have a negative 

impact on the credibility of the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime; 

 (f) The long-term plans for the modernization of nuclear weapons arsenals 

run contrary to commitments and obligations to nuclear disarmament and engender 

perceptions of the indefinite possession of these weapons;  

 (g) In a world where basic human needs have not yet been met, the vast 

resources allocated to the modernization of nuclear weapons arsenals could instead 

be redirected to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals; 10 

 (h) Given the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons, it is inconceivable that 

any use of nuclear weapons, irrespective of the cause, would be compatible wit h the 

requirements of international humanitarian law or international law, or the laws of 

morality, or the dictates of public conscience;  

 (i) Given their indiscriminate nature and potential to annihilate humanity, 

nuclear weapons are inherently immoral;  

 4. Notes that all responsible States have a solemn duty to take decisions that 

serve to protect their people and each other from the ravages of a nuclear weapon 

detonation, and that the only way for States to do so is through the total elimination 

of nuclear weapons; 

 5. Stresses that all States share an ethical responsibility to act with urgency 

and determination, with the support of all relevant stakeholders, to take the effective 

measures, including legally binding measures, necessary to eliminate and pr ohibit all 

nuclear weapons, given their catastrophic humanitarian consequences and associated 

risks; 

 6. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-seventh 

session, under the item entitled “General and complete disarmament”, the sub -item 

entitled “Ethical imperatives for a nuclear-weapon-free world”.
