deterrence, had heightened the risk of the- outbreak of nuclear war and led to
greater insecurity and instability in international relations, and that it was
also stated that nuclear weapons were more than weapons of war, that such
weapons were instruments of mass annihilation, as/

Noting further that, in the Political Declaration adopted by the Eighth
Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at
Harare from 1 to 6 September 1986, it was stated that the idea that world
peace could be maintained through ruclear deterrence, a tbctrine that lay at
the root of the continuing escalation in the quantity and quality of nuclear
weapons, was the most dangerous myth in existence, 19/

Believi- #at all nations have a vital interest in negotiations on
nuclear disarmznnent because the existence of rrrclear  weapons in the arsenals
of a handful of States directly and fundamentally jeopardizes the vital
security interests of both nuclear and non-nuclear-weapon States alike,

welcoming proposals on the complete elimination of nuclear weapons
throughout the world,

Considerinq that it is necessary to halt all testing, production and
deployment of nuclear 'weapons of all typus and versions and their delivery
systems as a first step in the process that should lead to the achievement of
substantial reductions in nuclear forces, and welcoming in this context the
Joint Declaration issued on 22 May 1984 by the heads of State or Government of
Al gentina, Greece, India, MexicoI Sweden and the United Republic of
Tanzania, 20/ which was reaffirmed in the Delht Declaration 21/ and the Mexico
Declaration 22/ issued by the leaders of those States on 28 January 1985 and
7 August 1987;r respectively,

Notinq that in the Conference on Disarmament, at its 1987 session,

Convinced that the prevention of nuclear war and the reduction of the
risk of nuclear war are matters of the highest priority and of vital interest
to all people of the world,

Also convinced that the prevention of nuclear war is a problem too
important to be left to the nuolear-weapnn  States alone,

1. Notes with regret that, despite the fact that the Conference on
Disarmament has discussed the question of the prevention of nuclear war for
several years, it has been unable even to establish a subsidiary body to
consider appropriate and practical measures to prevent it;

2. Reiterates its conviction that, in vi@w of the urgency of the matter
and the inadequacy or insufficiency of existing measures, it is necessary to
devise suitable steps to expedite effective action for the prevention of
nuclear war;

3. Again requests the Conr'erence  on Disarmmalt  to undertake, as a
matter of the highest priority , negotiations with a view to achieving
agreement on appropriate and practical measures that could be negotiated and
adopted individually for the prevention of nuclear war and to establish for
that purpose an ad hoc ccmmittee on the subject at the beginning of its 1988
session t

4. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its forty-third
session the item ent,itled ‘Pre~ntion of nuclear war”.

International co-operation for disarmament

The General Assedly,

Stressing again the urgent need for an active and sustained effort to
expedite the implementation of the recommendations and decisions unanimously
adopted at its tenth special session, 27J the first special session devoted to
disarmament,

Recalling  the Declaration .on International Co-operation for Disarmament
of 11 December 1979 21 and its resolutions 36/92 D of 9 December 1981,

17 December 1484, 40/152 I of 16 December 1985 and 41/86 K of 5 December 1986,

Stressing the vital need to proceed to balanced, mutually acceptable,
comprehensively verifiable and eft’ective measures towards halting the arms
race and attaining disarmament, particularly in the nuclear field, for the
preservation of peace and the strengthening of comprehensive international
security,

Bearing in mind the vital interests of all States in the adoption of
concrete effective disarmament measures, which would, through conversiOnr
release considerable material, financial and human resources to be used for
peaceful purposes and, with the assistance of the respective international
machinery, particularly for overcoming economic  underdevelopment in the
developing countries,

Convinced of the need to strengthen constructive international
co-operation based on the political goodwill of States for successful
negotiations on disarmament , and on the increased openness in military matters
in accordance with the priorities established in the Final Document of the
Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly, 27/

Stressing that international co-operation for disarmament should, as a
matter of priority, be aimed at averting nuclear war through the gradual
elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, the
discontinuation of nuclear-weapon tests , the prevention of an arms race in
outer space and conventional disarmament on a global scale, taking into
account the characteristics of the different regions, and at
confidence-building as an indispensable component of relations among States8

Considering  that the progress towards a nuclear-weapon-free world can be
executed  stage by stage in terms of both participation and armaments to be
covered, with the steady strengthening of international security and stability,

Believing that a broader internationalization of all disarmament
negotiations would be an important factor contributing to their success,

Notiw wfth satisfaction an increased dynamism of the efforts of the
international community to avert the nuclear threat and to make  a genuine
breakthrough in the field of disarmament,

Dmphasizinq that the two nuclear-weapon States possessing the mQst
important nuclear arsenals should continue and further expedite their
negotiations with a view to curbing the nuclear arms race while mutually
refraining from launching weapons into outer spacer

Believing that all nuclear-weapon States should make their national
contributions to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free world,

Conscious that in the nuclear space age the reliable security of all
countries in all spheres of international relations can be ensured only by
political means, through the joint efforts of a11 States,

Exprassinq its deep concern and disamointment that the Conference on
Disarmament has not been enabled, this year either, to reach concrete
agreements on any disarmament issues to which the United Nations has assigned
greatest priority and urgency and which have been under consideration for a
number of years,

1. Notes with satisfaction that further progress has been made in the
negotiations on the elaboration of a draft convention on the complete and
effective prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of all
chemical weapons and on their destruction , and urges the Conference on
Disarmament to intensify further its work with a view to cmpleting
negotiations on such a draft convention;

2. Calls upon the Conference on Disarmanent to intensify its work, to
further its mandate more earnestly through negotiations and to adopt concrete

3, Once again urges the Conference on Disarmanent to continue or to
undertake, during its 1988 session , substantive negotiations on the priority
questions of disarmament on its agenda, in accordance with the provisions of
the Final mcument of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly and
other resolutions of the Assembly on those questions;

4 . Calls upon the Conferetxx on Disarmament to provide the existing
ad hoc carunittees with appropriate negotiating mandates and to establish, as a

Implementation of the recaamendations and decisions of
the tenth special session

The Genera I Assenioly ,

Raving reviewed the implementation of the recuumendations and decisions
adopted by the General Assembly at its tenth special session, 47J the first
special session devoted to disarmament, as well as the Concluding Document of
the Twelfth Special Session of the general Assembly, 48/ the second special
session devoted to disarmament,

Recalling its resolutions S-10/2 of 30 June 1978, 34/83 C of
,13. December 1979, 35/46 of 3 December 1980, 354152 C of 12 December 1980,
36/92 M of 9 December 1981, 37/78 F of 9 December 1982, 38/183 R of
20 December 1983, 39,448 0 of 17 December 1984, 40/152  N of 16 December 1985
and 41/86 0 of 4 December 1986 and its decision S-12/24 of 10 July 1982,

Deeply concerned that no concrete results regarding the implementation of
the rFommendations  and decisions of the t;enth special session have been
realized in the course of the more than nine years since that session,

Convinced that international peace and security can be ensured only
through general and complete disarmament under effective international control
and that one of the most urgent tasks is to halt and reverse the arms race and
to undertake concrete measures of disarmament, particularly nuclear
disarmament, and that, in this respect, the nuclear-weapon States and other
militarily significant States have the primary responsibility,

Noting with satisfaction.that the two leading rxlclear-ueapon  States have
reached an agreement in principle on the elimination of intermediate-range and
shorter-range missiles,

Convinced that the conclusion of a treaty on the elimination of
intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles would positively affect the
overall negotiations on disarmament,

Stressing once again that the active participation of Member States in
effective disarmament negotiations is necessary for discharging their
responsibility to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and
security, that all States have the right to contribute to efforts in the field
of disarmament , that it is more than ever imperative in the present

4J Resolution S-10/2.
