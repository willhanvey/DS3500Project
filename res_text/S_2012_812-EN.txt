 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions on the situation in Somalia, in particular 
resolution 1772 (2007),  

 Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political 
independence and unity of Somalia and reiterating its commitment to a 
comprehensive and lasting settlement of the situation in Somalia, 

 Recalling its decision in resolution 2036 (2012) to expand the logistical 
support package for AMISOM to include the reimbursement of certain contingent 
owned equipment including force enablers and multipliers, 

 Determining that the situation in Somalia continues to constitute a threat to 
international peace and security in the region, 

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 

 1. Decides to authorise the Member States of the African Union to maintain 
the deployment until 7 March 2013 of AMISOM, which shall be authorised to take 
all necessary measures, in compliance with applicable international humanitarian 
and human rights law, and in full respect of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, 
political independence and unity of Somalia, to carry out the following tasks: 

 (a) To maintain a presence in the four sectors set out in the AMISOM 
Strategic Concept of 5 January 2012, and in those sectors, in coordination with the 
SNSF, reduce the threat posed by Al Shabaab and other armed opposition groups in 
order to establish conditions for effective and legitimate governance across Somalia; 

 (b) To support dialogue and reconciliation in Somalia by assisting with the 
free movement, safe passage and protection of all those involved with the peace and 
reconciliation process in Somalia; 

 (c) To provide, as appropriate, protection to the Somali authorities to help 
them carry out their functions of government, and security for key infrastructure;

and to ensure the security and freedom of movement of its personnel, as well as of

mission to extend the United Nations logistical support package for AMISOM 
civilian personnel for a further 50 civilian personnel, on a temporary basis to be 
reviewed in light of the upcoming AU and United Nations strategic reviews, 
underlines the importance of these civilians deploying swiftly to areas recently

and paragraphs 4 and 6 of resolution 2036 (2012) for a maximum of 17,731 
uniformed personnel until 7 March 2013, ensuring the accountability and 
transparency of expenditure of the United Nations funds as set out in paragraph 4 of 
resolution 1910 (2010); 

 5. Requests the African Union to keep the Security Council regularly 
informed, through the Secretary-General, on the implementation of AMISOM’s 
mandate, and report to the Council, through the provision of written reports, 60 days
