Annex 
 

  Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration 
 

 

 We, the Heads of State and Government and High Representatives, meeting in 

Morocco on 10 and 11 December 2018, reaffirming the New York Declaration for 

Refugees and Migrants and determined to make an important contribution to 

enhanced cooperation on international migration in all its dimensions, have adopted 

this Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration: 

 

 

  Preamble 
 

 

1. This Global Compact rests on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the 

United Nations. 

2. It also rests on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the International 

Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the International Covenant on Economic, 

Social and Cultural Rights; the other core international human rights treaties; 1 the 

United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, including the 

Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women 

and Children, and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and 

Air; the Slavery Convention and the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of 

Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery; the United 

Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; the United Nations Convention 

to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or 

Desertification, Particularly in Africa; the Paris Agreement; 2  and the International 

Labour Organization conventions on promoting decent work and labour migration, 3 

as well as on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; the Addis Ababa Action 

Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development; the 

Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030; and the New Urban 

Agenda. 

3. Discussions about international migration at the global level are not new. We 

recall the advances made through the United Nations High-level Dialogues on 

International Migration and Development in 2006 and 2013. We also acknowledge 

the contributions of the Global Forum on Migration and Development, launched in 

2007. These platforms paved the way for the New York Declaration for Refugees and 

Migrants, through which we committed to elaborate a global compact on refugees and 

to adopt this Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, in two 

separate processes. The two global compacts, together, present complementary 

international cooperation frameworks that fulfil their respective mandates as laid out 

in the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, which recognizes that 

migrants and refugees may face many common challenges and similar vulnerabilities.

4. Refugees and migrants are entitled to the same universal human right s and 

fundamental freedoms, which must be respected, protected and fulfilled at all times. 

However, migrants and refugees are distinct groups governed by separate legal 

frameworks. Only refugees are entitled to the specific international protection defined  

by international refugee law. This Global Compact refers to migrants and presents a 

cooperative framework addressing migration in all its dimensions.  

5. As a contribution to the preparatory process for this Global Compact, we 

recognize the inputs shared by Member States and relevant stakeholders during the 

consultation and stocktaking phases, as well as the report of the Secretary-General 

entitled “Making migration work for all”. 

6. This Global Compact is a milestone in the history of the global dialogue and 

international cooperation on migration. It is rooted in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, and informed by the Declaration 

of the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development, adopted in 

October 2013. It builds on the pioneering work of the former Special Representative 

of the Secretary-General on Migration, including his report of 3 February 2017.  

7. This Global Compact presents a non-legally binding, cooperative framework 

that builds on the commitments agreed upon by Member States in the New York 

Declaration for Refugees and Migrants. It fosters international cooperation among all 

relevant actors on migration, acknowledging that no State can address migration 

alone, and upholds the sovereignty of States and their obligations under international 

law. 

 

 

  Our vision and guiding principles 
 

 

8. This Global Compact expresses our collective commitment to improving 

cooperation on international migration. Migration has been part of the human 

experience throughout history, and we recognize that it is a source of prosperity, 

innovation and sustainable development in our globalized world, and that these 

positive impacts can be optimized by improving migration governance. The majority 

of migrants around the world today travel, live and work in a safe, orderly and regular 

manner. Nonetheless, migration undeniably affects our countries, communities, 

migrants and their families in very different and sometimes unpredictable ways.  

9. It is crucial that the challenges and opportunities of international migration unite 

us, rather than divide us. This Global Compact sets out our common understanding, 

shared responsibilities and unity of purpose regarding migration, making it work for 

all. 

 

  Common understanding 
 

10. This Global Compact is the product of an unprecedented review of evidence and 

data gathered during an open, transparent and inclusive process. We shared our 

realities and heard diverse voices, enriching and shaping our common understanding 

of this complex phenomenon. We learned that migration is a defining feature of our 

globalized world, connecting societies within and across all regions, making us all 

countries of origin, transit and destination. We recognize that there is a continuous 

need for international efforts to strengthen our knowledge and analysis of migration, 

as shared understandings will improve policies that unlock the potential of sustainable 

development for all. We must collect and disseminate quality data. We must ensure 

that current and potential migrants are fully informed about their rights, obligations 

and options for safe, orderly and regular migration, and are aware of the risks of 

irregular migration. We also must provide all our citizens with access to objective, 

evidence-based, clear information about the benefits and challenges of migration, 



A/73/L.66 
 

 

18-21786 4/35 

 

with a view to dispelling misleading narratives that generate negative perceptions of 

migrants.  

 

  Shared responsibilities 
 

11. This Global Compact offers a 360-degree vision of international migration and 

recognizes that a comprehensive approach is needed to optimize the overall benefits 

of migration, while addressing risks and challenges for individuals and communities 

in countries of origin, transit and destination. No country can address the challenges 

and opportunities of this global phenomenon on its own. With this comprehensive 

approach, we aim to facilitate safe, orderly and regular migration, while reducing the 

incidence and negative impact of irregular migration through internatio nal 

cooperation and a combination of measures put forward in this Global Compact. We 

acknowledge our shared responsibilities to one another as States Members of the 

United Nations to address each other’s needs and concerns over migration, and an 

overarching obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of all migrants, 

regardless of their migration status, while promoting the security and prosperity of all 

our communities. 

12. This Global Compact aims to mitigate the adverse drivers and structural factors 

that hinder people from building and maintaining sustainable livelihoods in their 

countries of origin, and so compel them to seek a future elsewhere. It intends to reduce 

the risks and vulnerabilities migrants face at different stages of migrat ion by 

respecting, protecting and fulfilling their human rights and providing them with care 

and assistance. It seeks to address legitimate concerns of communities, while 

recognizing that societies are undergoing demographic, economic, social and 

environmental changes at different scales that may have implications for and result 

from migration. It strives to create conducive conditions that enable all migrants to 

enrich our societies through their human, economic and social capacities, and thus 

facilitate their contributions to sustainable development at the local, national, regional 

and global levels. 

 

  Unity of purpose 
 

13. This Global Compact recognizes that safe, orderly and regular migration works 

for all when it takes place in a well-informed, planned and consensual manner. 

Migration should never be an act of desperation. When it is, we must cooperate to 

respond to the needs of migrants in situations of vulnerability, and address the 

respective challenges. We must work together to create conditions tha t allow 

communities and individuals to live in safety and dignity in their own countries. We 

must save lives and keep migrants out of harm’s way. We must empower migrants to 

become full members of our societies, highlight their positive contributions, and 

promote inclusion and social cohesion. We must generate greater predictability and 

certainty for States, communities and migrants alike. To achieve this, we commit to 

facilitate and ensure safe, orderly and regular migration for the benefit of all.  

14. Our success rests on the mutual trust, determination and solidarity of States to 

fulfil the objectives and commitments contained in this Global Compact. We unite, in 

a spirit of win-win cooperation, to address the challenges and opportunities of 

migration in all its dimensions through shared responsibility and innovative solutions. 

It is with this sense of common purpose that we take this historic step, fully aware 

that the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration is a milestone, but 

not the end to our efforts. We commit to continue the multilateral dialogue at the 

United Nations through a periodic and effective follow-up and review mechanism, 

ensuring that the words in this document translate into concrete actions for the benefit 

of millions of people in every region of the world.  



 
A/73/L.66 

 

5/35 18-21786 

 

15. We agree that this Global Compact is based on a set of cross-cutting and 

interdependent guiding principles:  

 (a) People-centred. The Global Compact carries a strong human dimension, 

inherent to the migration experience itself. It promotes the well-being of migrants and 

the members of communities in countries of origin, transit and destination. As a result, 

the Global Compact places individuals at its core;  

 (b) International cooperation. The Global Compact is a non-legally binding 

cooperative framework that recognizes that no State can address migration on its own 

because of the inherently transnational nature of the phenomenon. It requires 

international, regional and bilateral cooperation and dialogue. Its authority rests on 

its consensual nature, credibility, collective ownership, joint implementation, follow -

up and review;  

 (c) National sovereignty. The Global Compact reaffirms the sovereign right 

of States to determine their national migration policy and their prerogative to govern 

migration within their jurisdiction, in conformity with international law. Within their 

sovereign jurisdiction, States may distinguish between regular and irregular migration 

status, including as they determine their legislative and policy measures for the 

implementation of the Global Compact, taking into account different national 

realities, policies, priorities and requirements for entry, residence and work, in 

accordance with international law;  

 (d) Rule of law and due process. The Global Compact recognizes that respect 

for the rule of law, due process and access to justice are fundamental to all aspects of 

migration governance. This means that the State, public and private institutions and 

entities, as well as persons themselves, are accountable to laws that are publicly 

promulgated, equally enforced and independently adjudicated, and are consistent with 

international law;  

 (e) Sustainable development. The Global Compact is rooted in the 2030 

Agenda for Sustainable Development, and builds upon its recognition that migration 

is a multidimensional reality of major relevance for the sustainable development of 

countries of origin, transit and destination, which requires coherent and 

comprehensive responses. Migration contributes to positive development outcomes 

and to realizing the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, especially 

when it is properly managed. The Global Compact aims to leverage the potential of 

migration for the achievement of all Sustainable Development Goals, as well as the 

impact this achievement will have on migration in the future;  

 (f) Human rights. The Global Compact is based on international human rights 

law and upholds the principles of non-regression and non-discrimination. By 

implementing the Global Compact, we ensure effective respect for and protection and 

fulfilment of the human rights of all migrants, regardless of their migration status, 

across all stages of the migration cycle. We also reaffirm the commitment to eliminate 

all forms of discrimination, including racism, xenophobia and intolerance, against 

migrants and their families; 

 (g) Gender-responsive. The Global Compact ensures that the human rights of 

women, men, girls and boys are respected at all stages of migration, that their specific 

needs are properly understood and addressed and that they are empowered as agents 

of change. It mainstreams a gender perspective and promotes gender equality and the 

empowerment of all women and girls, recognizing their independence, agency and 

leadership in order to move away from addressing migrant women primarily through 

a lens of victimhood; 

 (h) Child-sensitive. The Global Compact promotes existing international legal 

obligations in relation to the rights of the child, and upholds the principle of the b est 



A/73/L.66 
 

 

18-21786 6/35 

 

interests of the child at all times, as a primary consideration in all situations 

concerning children in the context of international migration, including 

unaccompanied and separated children;  

 (i) Whole-of-government approach. The Global Compact considers that 

migration is a multidimensional reality that cannot be addressed by one government 

policy sector alone. To develop and implement effective migration policies and 

practices, a whole-of-government approach is needed to ensure horizontal and 

vertical policy coherence across all sectors and levels of government;  

 (j) Whole-of-society approach. The Global Compact promotes broad multi-

stakeholder partnerships to address migration in all its dimensions by including 

migrants, diasporas, local communities, civil society, academia, the private sector, 

parliamentarians, trade unions, national human rights institutions, the media and other 

relevant stakeholders in migration governance.  

 

 

  Our cooperative framework 
 

 

16. With the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, we adopted a 

political declaration and a set of commitments. Reaffirming that Declaration in its 

entirety, we build upon it by laying out the following cooperative framework, 

comprising 23 objectives, implementation, as well as follow-up and review. Each 

objective contains a commitment, followed by a range of actions considered to be 

relevant policy instruments and best practices. To fulfil the 23 objectives, we will 

draw from these actions to achieve safe, orderly and regular migration a long the 

migration cycle.

  Objectives and commitments 
 

 

  Objective 1: Collect and utilize accurate and disaggregated data as a basis for 

evidence-based policies 
 

17. We commit to strengthen the global evidence base on international migration by 

improving and investing in the collection, analysis and dissemination of accurate, 

reliable and comparable data, disaggregated by sex, age, migration status and other 

characteristics relevant in national contexts, while upholding the right to privacy 

under international human rights law and protecting personal data. We further commit 

to ensure that this data fosters research, guides coherent and evidence-based 

policymaking and well-informed public discourse, and allows for effective 

monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of commitments over time.  

 To realize this commitment, we will draw from the following actions: 

 (a) Elaborate and implement a comprehensive strategy for improving 

migration data at the local, national, regional and global levels, with the participation 

of all relevant stakeholders, under the guidance of the Statistical Commissio n of the 

United Nations, by harmonizing methodologies for data collection, and strengthening 

analysis and dissemination of migration-related data and indicators;  

 (b) Improve international comparability and compatibility of migration 

statistics and national data systems, including by further developing and applying the 

statistical definition of an international migrant, elaborating a set of standards to 

measure migrant stocks and flows, and documenting migration patterns and trends, 

characteristics of migrants, as well as drivers and impacts of migration;  

 (c) Develop a global programme to build and enhance national capacities in 

data collection, analysis and dissemination to share data, address data gaps and assess 

key migration trends, that encourages collaboration between relevant stakeholders at 



A/73/L.66 
 

 

18-21786 8/35 

 

all levels, provides dedicated training, financial support and technical assistance, 

leverages new data sources, including big data, and is reviewed by the Statistical 

Commission on a regular basis; 

 (d) Collect, analyse and use data on the effects and benefits of migration, as 

well as the contributions of migrants and diasporas to sustainable development, with 

a view to informing the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

Development and related strategies and programmes at the local, national, regional 

and global levels;  

 (e) Support further development of and collaboration between existing global 

and regional databases and depositories, including the International Organization for 

Migration (IOM) Global Migration Data Portal and the World Bank Global 

Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development, with a view to systematically 

consolidating relevant data in a transparent and user-friendly manner, while 

encouraging inter-agency collaboration to avoid duplication; 

 (f) Establish and strengthen regional centres for research and training on 

migration or migration observatories, such as the African Observatory for Migration 

and Development, to collect and analyse data in line with United Nations standar ds, 

including on best practices, the contributions of migrants, the overall economic, social 

and political benefits and challenges of migration in countries of origin, transit and 

destination, as well as drivers of migration, with a view to establishing shared 

strategies and maximizing the value of disaggregated migration data, in coordination 

with existing regional and subregional mechanisms;  

 (g) Improve national data collection by integrating migration-related topics 

into national censuses, as early as practicable, such as on country of birth, country of 

birth of parents, country of citizenship, country of residence five years prior to the 

census, most recent arrival date and reason for migrating, to ensure timely analysis 

and dissemination of results, disaggregated and tabulated in accordance with 

international standards, for statistical purposes;  

 (h) Conduct household, labour force and other surveys to collect information 

on the social and economic integration of migrants or add standard migration modules 

to existing household surveys to improve national, regional and international 

comparability, and make collected data available through public use of statistical 

microdata files;  

 (i) Enhance collaboration between State units responsible for migration d ata 

and national statistical offices to produce migration-related statistics, including by 

using administrative records for statistical purposes, such as border records, visas, 

resident permits, population registers and other relevant sources, while uphold ing the 

right to privacy and protecting personal data;  

 (j) Develop and use country-specific migration profiles, which include 

disaggregated data on all migration-relevant aspects in a national context, including 

those on labour market needs, demand for and availability of skills, the economic, 

environmental and social impacts of migration, remittance transfer costs, health, 

education, occupation, living and working conditions, wages, and the needs of 

migrants and receiving communities, in order to develop evidence-based migration 

policies;  

 (k) Cooperate with relevant stakeholders in countries of origin, transit and 

destination to develop research, studies and surveys on the interrelationship between 

migration and the three dimensions of sustainable development, the contributions and 

skills of migrants and diasporas, as well as their ties to the countries of origin and 

destination.

  Objective 2: Minimize the adverse drivers and structural factors that compel 

people to leave their country of origin 
 

18. We commit to create conducive political, economic, social and environmental 

conditions for people to lead peaceful, productive and sustainable lives in their own 

country and to fulfil their personal aspirations, while ensuring that desperation and 

deteriorating environments do not compel them to seek a livelihood elsewhere 

through irregular migration. We further commit to ensure timely and full 

implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as well as to build 

upon and invest in the implementation of other existing frameworks, in order to 

enhance the overall impact of the Global Compact to facilitate safe, orderly and 

regular migration.  

 To realize this commitment, we will draw from the following actions:  

 (a) Promote the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

Development, including the Sustainable Development Goals and the Addis Ababa 

Action Agenda, and the commitment to reach the furthest behind first, as well as the 

Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030;  

 (b) Invest in programmes that accelerate States’ fulfilment of the Sustainable 

Development Goals with the aim of eliminating the adverse drivers and structural 

factors that compel people to leave their country of origin, including through  poverty 

eradication, food security, health and sanitation, education, inclusive economic 

growth, infrastructure, urban and rural development, employment creation, decent 

work, gender equality and empowerment of women and girls, resilience and disaster 

risk reduction, climate change mitigation and adaptation, addressing the 

socioeconomic effects of all forms of violence, non-discrimination, the rule of law 

and good governance, access to justice and protection of human rights, as well as 

creating and maintaining peaceful and inclusive societies with effective, accountable 

and transparent institutions;  

 (c) Establish or strengthen mechanisms to monitor and anticipate the 

development of risks and threats that might trigger or affect migration movements, 

strengthen early warning systems, develop emergency procedures and toolkits, launch 

emergency operations and support post-emergency recovery, in close cooperation 

with and in support of other States, relevant national and local authorities, national 

human rights institutions and civil society;  

 (d) Invest in sustainable development at the local and national levels in all 

regions, allowing all people to improve their lives and meet their aspirations, by 

fostering sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, including through 

private and foreign direct investment and trade preferences, to create conducive 

conditions that allow communities and individuals to take advantage of opportunities 

in their own countries and drive sustainable development;  

 (e) Invest in human capital development by promoting entrepreneurship, 

education, vocational training and skills development programmes and partnerships, 

productive employment creation, in line with labour market needs, as well as in 

cooperation with the private sector and trade unions, with a view to reducing youth 

unemployment, avoiding brain drain and optimizing brain gain in countries of origin, 

and harnessing the demographic dividend;  

 (f) Strengthen collaboration between humanitarian and development actors, 

including by promoting joint analysis, multi-donor approaches and multi-year

accessible. 

 

  Objective 13: Use immigration detention only as a measure of last resort and 

work towards alternatives 
 

29.  We commit to ensure that any detention in the context of international migration 

follows due process, is non-arbitrary, is based on law, necessity, proportionality and 

individual assessments, is carried out by authorized officials and is for the shortest 

possible period of time, irrespective of whether detention occurs at the moment of 

entry, in transit or in proceedings of return, and regardless of the type of place where 

the detention occurs. We further commit to prioritize non-custodial alternatives to 

detention that are in line with international law, and to take a human rights -based 

approach to any detention of migrants, using detention as a measure of last resort 

only.

a form of cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment of migrants, in accordance with 

international human rights law;  

 (d) Provide access to justice for all migrants in countries of transit and 

destination who are or may be subject to detention, including by facilitating access to 

free or affordable legal advice and assistance of a qualified and independent lawyer, 

as well as access to information and the right to regular review of a detention order;  

 (e) Ensure that all migrants in detention are informed about the reasons for 

their detention, in a language they understand, and facilitate the exercise of their 

rights, including to communicate with the respective consular or diplomatic missions 

without delay, legal representatives and family members, in accordance with 

international law and due process guarantees;  

 (f) Reduce the negative and potentially lasting effects of detention on 

migrants by guaranteeing due process and proportionality, that it is for the shortest 

period of time, that it safeguards physical and mental integrity, and that, at a

the right to family life and family unity, and by working to end the practice of child 

detention in the context of international migration.  

 

  Objective 14: Enhance consular protection, assistance and cooperation 

throughout the migration cycle 
 

30.  We commit to strengthen consular protection of and assistance to our nationals 

abroad, as well as consular cooperation between States, in order to better safeguard 

the rights and interests of all migrants at all times, and to build upon the  functions of

consular services related to migration, but do not have a diplomatic or consular 

presence;  

 (d)  Strengthen consular capacities in order to identify, protect and assist our 

nationals abroad who are in a situation of vulnerability, including victims of human 

and labour rights violations or abuse, victims of crime, victims of trafficking in

Health Organization Framework of Priorities and Guiding Principles to Pro mote the 

Health of Refugees and Migrants; 

 (f)  Provide inclusive and equitable quality education to migrant children and 

youth, as well as facilitate access to lifelong learning opportunities, including by

local, national, regional and global levels, taking into consideration relevant existing 

policy guidelines and recommendations, such as the Global Migration Group ’s 

Mainstreaming Migration into Development Planning: A Handbook for Policymakers 

and Practitioners, in order to strengthen policy coherence and effectiveness of 

development cooperation; 



A/73/L.66 
 

 

18-21786 28/35 

 

 (c)  Invest in research on the impact of non-financial contributions of migrants 

and diasporas to sustainable development in countries of origin and destination, such 

as knowledge and skills transfer, social and civic engagement, and cultural exchange, 

with a view to developing evidence-based policies and strengthening global policy 

discussions;  

 (d)  Facilitate the contributions of migrants and diasporas to their countries of 

origin, including by establishing or strengthening government structures or 

mechanisms at all levels, such as dedicated diaspora offices or focal points, diaspora 

policy advisory boards for Governments to account for the potential of migrants and 

diasporas in migration and development policymaking, and dedicated diaspora focal 

points in diplomatic or consular missions;  

 (e)  Develop targeted support programmes and financial products that 

facilitate migrant and diaspora investments and entrepreneurship , including by 

providing administrative and legal support in business creation and granting seed 

capital-matching, establish diaspora bonds, diaspora development funds and 

investment funds, and organize dedicated trade fairs;  

 (f)  Provide easily accessible information and guidance, including through 

digital platforms, as well as tailored mechanisms for the coordinated and effective 

financial, voluntary or philanthropic engagement of migrants and diasporas, 

especially in humanitarian emergencies in their countries of origin, including by 

involving consular missions; 

 (g)  Enable political participation and engagement of migrants in their 

countries of origin, including in peace and reconciliation processes, in elections and 

political reforms, such as by establishing voting registries for citizens abroad, and 

through parliamentary representation, in accordance with national legislation;  

 (h)  Promote migration policies that optimize the benefits of diasporas for 

countries of origin and destination and their communities, by facilitating flexible 

modalities to travel, work and invest with minimal administrative burdens, including 

by reviewing and revising visa, residency and citizenship regulations, as appropriate;  

 (i)  Cooperate with other States, the private sector and employers’ 

organizations to enable migrants and diasporas, especially those in highly technical 

fields and in high demand, to carry out some of their professional activities and 

engage in knowledge transfer in their home countries, without necessarily losing 

employment, residence status or earned social benefits;  

 (j)  Build partnerships between local authorities, local communities, the 

private sector, diasporas, hometown associations and migrant organizations to 

promote knowledge and skills transfer between their countries of origin and their 

countries of destination, including by mapping the diasporas and their skills, as a 

means to maintain the link between diasporas and their country of origin.  

 

  Objective 20: Promote faster, safer and cheaper transfer of remittances and 

foster financial inclusion of migrants 
 

36.  We commit to promote faster, safer and cheaper remittances by further 

developing existing conducive policy and regulatory environments that enable 

competition, regulation and innovation on the remittance market and by providing 

gender-responsive programmes and instruments that enhance the financial inclusion 

of migrants and their families. We further commit to optimize the transformative 

impact of remittances on the well-being of migrant workers and their families, as well 

as on the sustainable development of countries, while respecting that remittances 

constitute an important source of private capital and cannot be equated to other 



 
A/73/L.66 

 

29/35 18-21786 

 

international financial flows, such as foreign direct  investment, official development 

assistance or other public sources of financing for development.  

 To realize this commitment, we will draw from the following actions:  

 (a) Develop a road map to reduce the transaction costs of migrant remittances 

to less than 3 per cent and eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher than 5 per 

cent by 2030 in line with target 10.c of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development;  

 (b) Promote and support the United Nations International Day of Family 

Remittances and the International Fund for Agricultural Development Global Forum 

on Remittances, Investment and Development as an important platform to build and 

strengthen partnerships for innovative solutions on cheaper, faster and safer transfer 

of remittances with all relevant stakeholders; 

 (c) Harmonize remittance market regulations and increase the interoperability 

of remittance infrastructure along corridors by ensuring that measures to combat 

illicit financial flows and money-laundering do not impede migrant remittances 

through undue, excessive or discriminatory policies;  

 (d) Establish conducive policy and regulatory frameworks that promote a 

competitive and innovative remittance market, remove unwarranted obstacles to non -

bank remittance service providers in accessing payment system infrastructure, apply 

tax exemptions or incentives to remittance transfers, promote market access to diverse 

service providers, incentivize the private sector to expand remittance services, and 

enhance the security and predictability of low-value transactions by bearing in mind 

de-risking concerns, and developing a methodology to distinguish remittances from 

illicit flows, in consultation with remittance service providers and financial 

regulators;  

 (e) Develop innovative technological solutions for remittance transfer, such 

as mobile payments, digital tools or e-banking, to reduce costs, improve speed, 

enhance security, increase transfer through regular channels and open up gender-

responsive distribution channels to underserved populat ions, including persons in 

rural areas, persons with low levels of literacy and persons with disabilities;  

 (f) Provide accessible information on remittance transfer costs by provider 

and channel, such as comparison websites, in order to increase the transparency and 

competition on the remittance transfer market, and promote financial literacy and 

inclusion of migrants and their families through education and training;  

 (g) Develop programmes and instruments to promote investments from 

remittance senders in local development and entrepreneurship in countries of origin, 

such as through matching-grant mechanisms, municipal bonds and partnerships with 

hometown associations, in order to enhance the transformative potential of 

remittances beyond the individual households of migrant workers at all skills levels;  

 (h) Enable migrant women to access financial literacy training and formal 

remittance transfer systems, as well as to open a bank account and own and manage 

financial assets, investments and businesses as means to address gender inequalities 

and foster their active participation in the economy;  

 (i) Provide access to and develop banking solutions and financial instruments 

for migrants, including low-income and female-headed households, such as bank 

accounts that permit direct deposits by employers, savings accounts, loans and credits 

in cooperation with the banking sector.

  Objective 21: Cooperate in facilitating safe and dignified return and 

readmission, as well as sustainable reintegration  
 

37.  We commit to facilitate and cooperate for safe and dignified return and to 

guarantee due process, individual assessment and effective remedy, by upholding the 

prohibition of collective expulsion and of returning migrants when there is a real and 

foreseeable risk of death, torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment 

or punishment, or other irreparable harm, in accordance with our obligations under 

international human rights law. We further commit to ensure that our nationals are 

duly received and readmitted, in full respect for the human right to return to one’s 

own country and the obligation of States to readmit their own nationals. We also 

commit to create conducive conditions for personal safety, economic empowerment, 

inclusion and social cohesion in communities, in order to ensure that reintegration of 

migrants upon return to their countries of origin is sustainable.  

 To realize this commitment, we will draw from the following actions:  

 (a)  Develop and implement bilateral, regional and multilateral  cooperation 

frameworks and agreements, including readmission agreements, ensuring that return 

and readmission of migrants to their own country is safe, dignified and in full 

compliance with international human rights law, including the rights of the child , by 

determining clear and mutually agreed procedures that uphold procedural safeguards, 

guarantee individual assessments and legal certainty, and by ensuring that they also 

include provisions that facilitate sustainable reintegration;  

 (b)  Promote gender-responsive and child-sensitive return and reintegration 

programmes that may include legal, social and financial support, guaranteeing that 

all returns in the context of such voluntary programmes effectively take place on the 

basis of the migrant’s free, prior and informed consent, and that returning migrants 

are assisted in their reintegration process through effective partnerships, including to 

avoid their becoming displaced in the country of origin upon return;  

 (c)  Cooperate on identification of nationals and issuance of travel documents 

for safe and dignified return and readmission in cases of persons who do not have the 

legal right to stay on another State’s territory, by establishing reliable and efficient 

means of identification of our own nationals such as through the addition of biometric 

identifiers in population registries, and by digitalizing civil registry systems, with full 

respect for the right to privacy and protection of personal data;  

 (d)  Foster institutional contacts between consular authorities and relevant 

officials from countries of origin and destination, and provide adequate consular 

assistance to returning migrants prior to return by facilitating access to 

documentation, travel documents and other services, in order to ensure pred ictability, 

safety and dignity in return and readmission;  

 (e)  Ensure that the return of migrants who do not have the legal right to stay 

on another State’s territory is safe and dignified, follows an individual assessment, is 

carried out by competent authorities through prompt and effective cooperation 

between countries of origin and destination, and allows all applicable legal remedies 

to be exhausted, in compliance with due process guarantees and other obligations 

under international human rights law;  

 (f)  Establish or strengthen national monitoring mechanisms on return, in 

partnership with relevant stakeholders, that provide independent recommendations on 

ways and means to strengthen accountability, in order to guarantee the safety, dignity 

and human rights of all returning migrants; 

 (g)  Ensure that return and readmission processes involving children are 

carried out only after a determination of the best interests of the child and take into 



 
A/73/L.66 

 

31/35 18-21786 

 

account the right to family life and family unity, and that a  parent, legal guardian or 

specialized official accompanies the child throughout the return process, ensuring that 

appropriate reception, care and reintegration arrangements for children are in place 

in the country of origin upon return;  

 (h)  Facilitate the sustainable reintegration of returning migrants into 

community life by providing them with equal access to social protection and services, 

justice, psychosocial assistance, vocational training, employment opportunities and 

decent work, recognition of skills acquired abroad, and financial services, in order to 

fully build upon their entrepreneurship, skills and human capital as active members 

of society and contributors to sustainable development in the country of origin upon 

return; 

 (i)  Identify and address the needs of the communities to which migrants 

return by including respective provisions in national and local development strategies, 

infrastructure planning, budget allocations and other relevant policy decisions and 

cooperating with local authorities and relevant stakeholders. 

 

  Objective 22: Establish mechanisms for the portability of social security 

entitlements and earned benefits 
 

38.  We commit to assist migrant workers at all skills levels to have access to social 

protection in countries of destination and profit from the portability of applicable 

social security entitlements and earned benefits in their countries of origin or when 

they decide to take up work in another country.  

 To realize this commitment, we will draw from the following actions:  

 (a)  Establish or maintain non-discriminatory national social protection 

systems, including social protection floors for nationals and migrants, in line with the 

ILO Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202);  

 (b)  Conclude reciprocal bilateral, regional or multilateral social security 

agreements on the portability of earned benefits for migrant workers at all skills 

levels, that refer to applicable social protection floors in the respective States and 

applicable social security entitlements and provisions, such as pensions, health care 

or other earned benefits, or integrate such provisions into other relevant agreements, 

such as those on long-term and temporary labour migration;  

 (c)  Integrate provisions on the portability of entitlements and earned benefits 

into national social security frameworks, designate focal points in countries of origin, 

transit and destination that facilitate portability requests from migrants, address the 

difficulties women and older persons can face in accessing social protection, and 

establish dedicated instruments, such as migrant welfare funds in countries of origin, 

that support migrant workers and their families.  

 

  Objective 23: Strengthen international cooperation and global partnerships for 

safe, orderly and regular migration 
 

39.  We commit to support each other in the realization of the objectives and 

commitments laid out in this Global Compact through enhanced international 

cooperation, a revitalized global partnership and, in the spirit of solidarity, 

reaffirming the centrality of a comprehensive and integrated approach to facilitate 

safe, orderly and regular migration and recognizing that we are all countries of origin, 

transit and destination. We further commit to take joint action, in addressing the 

challenges faced by each country, to implement this Global Compact, underscoring 

the specific challenges faced in particular by African countries, least developed 

countries, landlocked developing countries, small island developing States and 

middle-income countries. We also commit to promote the mutually reinforcing nature 



A/73/L.66 
 

 

18-21786 32/35 

 

between the Global Compact and existing international legal and policy frameworks, 

by aligning the implementation of this Global Compact with such frameworks, 

particularly the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as well as the Addis Ababa 

Action Agenda, and their recognition that migration and sustainable development are 

multidimensional and interdependent.  

 To realize this commitment, we will draw from the following actions:  

 (a)  Support other States as we collectively implement the Global Compact, 

including through the provision of financial and technical assistance, in line with 

national priorities, policies, action plans and strategies, through a whole -of-

government and whole-of-society approach; 

 (b)  Increase international and regional cooperation to accelerate the 

implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in geographical 

areas from which irregular migration systematically originates owing to consistent  

impacts of poverty, unemployment, climate change and disasters, inequality, 

corruption and poor governance, among other structural factors, through appropriate 

cooperation frameworks, innovative partnerships and the involvement of all relevant 

stakeholders, while upholding national ownership and shared responsibility;  

 (c)  Involve and support local authorities in the identification of needs and 

opportunities for international cooperation for the effective implementation of the 

Global Compact and integrate their perspectives and priorities into development 

strategies, programmes and planning on migration, as a means to ensure good 

governance as well as policy coherence across levels of government and policy 

sectors, and maximize the effectiveness and impact of international development 

cooperation; 

 (d)  Make use of the capacity-building mechanism and build upon other 

existing instruments to strengthen the capacities of relevant authorities by mobilizing 

technical, financial and human resources from States, international financial 

institutions, the private sector, international organizations and other sources in order 

to assist all States in fulfilling the commitments outlined in this Global Compact;  

 (e)  Conclude bilateral, regional or multilateral mutually beneficial, tailored 

and transparent partnerships, in line with international law, that develop targeted 

solutions to migration policy issues of common interest and address opportunities and 

challenges of migration in accordance with the Global Compact.  

 

 

  Implementation 
 

 

40.  For the effective implementation of the Global Compact, we require concerted 

efforts at the global, regional, national and local levels, including a coherent United 

Nations system.  

41.  We commit to fulfil the objectives and commitments outlined in the Global 

Compact, in line with our vision and guiding principles, by taking effective steps at 

all levels to facilitate safe, orderly and regular migration at all stages. We will 

implement the Global Compact, within our own countries and at the regional and 

global levels, taking into account different national realities, capacities and levels of 

development, and respecting national policies and priorities. We reaffirm our 

commitment to international law and emphasize that the Global Compact is to be 

implemented in a manner that is consistent with our rights and obligations under 

international law. 

42.  We will implement the Global Compact through enhanced bilateral, regional 

and multilateral cooperation and a revitalized global partnership in a spirit of 



 
A/73/L.66 

 

33/35 18-21786 

 

solidarity. We will continue building on existing mechanisms, platforms and 

frameworks to address migration in all its dimensions. Recognizing the centrality of 

international cooperation for the effective fulfilment of the objectives and 

commitments, we will strive to reinforce our engagement in North-South, South-

South and triangular cooperation and assistance. Our cooperation efforts in this regard 

will be aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis 

Ababa Action Agenda.  

43.  We decide to establish a capacity-building mechanism in the United Nations, 

building upon existing initiatives, that supports efforts of Member States to 

implement the Global Compact. It allows Member States, the United Nations and 

other relevant stakeholders, including the private sector and philanthropic 

foundations, to contribute technical, financial and human resources on a voluntary 

basis in order to strengthen capacities and foster multi -partner cooperation. The 

capacity-building mechanism will consist of: 

 (a)  A connection hub that facilitates demand-driven, tailor-made and 

integrated solutions, by:  

 (i)  Advising on, assessing and processing country requests for the 

development of solutions; 

 (ii)  Identifying main implementing partners within and outside of the United 

Nations system, in line with their comparative advantages and operational 

capacities; 

 (iii)  Connecting the request to similar initiatives and solutions for peer-to-peer 

exchange and potential replication, where existing and relevant; 

 (iv)  Ensuring effective set-up for multi-agency and multi-stakeholder 

implementation; 

 (v)  Identifying funding opportunities, including by initiating the start -up fund; 

 (b)  A start-up fund for initial financing to realize project-oriented solutions, by: 

 (i)  Providing seed funding, where needed, to jump-start a specific project; 

 (ii)  Complementing other funding sources;  

 (iii)  Receiving voluntary financial contributions by Member States, the United 

Nations, international financial institutions and other stakeholders, including the 

private sector and philanthropic foundations;  

 (c)  A global knowledge platform as an online open data source, by:  

 (i)  Serving as a repository of existing evidence, practices and initiatives;  

 (ii)  Facilitating the accessibility of knowledge and sharing of solutions;  

 (iii)  Building on the Global Forum on Migration and Development Platform 

for Partnerships and other relevant sources.  

44.  We will implement the Global Compact in cooperation and partnership with 

migrants, civil society, migrant and diaspora organizations, faith-based organizations, 

local authorities and communities, the private sector, trade unions, parliamentarians, 

national human rights institutions, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent 

Movement, academia, the media and other relevant stakeholders.  

45.  We welcome the decision of the Secretary-General to establish a United Nations 

network on migration to ensure effective and coherent system-wide support for 

implementation, including the capacity-building mechanism, as well as follow-up and 



A/73/L.66 
 

 

18-21786 34/35 

 

review of the Global Compact, in response to the needs of Member States. In this 

regard, we note that: 

 (a)  IOM will serve as the coordinator and secretariat of the network;  

 (b)  The network will fully draw from the technical expertise and experience 

of relevant entities within the United Nations system;  

 (c)  The work of the network will be fully aligned with existing coordination 

mechanisms and the repositioning of the United Nations development system. 

46.  We request the Secretary-General, drawing on the network, to report to the 

General Assembly on a biennial basis on the implementation of the Global Compact, 

the activities of the United Nations system in this regard, as well as the funct ioning 

of the institutional arrangements.  

47.  Further recognizing the important role of State-led processes and platforms at 

the global and regional levels in advancing the international dialogue on migration, 

we invite the Global Forum on Migration and Development, regional consultative 

processes and other global, regional and subregional forums to provide platforms to 

exchange experiences on the implementation of the Global Compact, share good 

practices on policies and cooperation, promote innovative approaches, and foster 

multi-stakeholder partnerships around specific policy issues.  

 

 

  Follow-up and review 
 

 

48.  We will review the progress made at the local, national, regional and global 

levels in implementing the Global Compact in the framework of the  United Nations 

through a State-led approach and with the participation of all relevant stakeholders. 

For follow-up and review, we agree on intergovernmental measures that will assist us 

in fulfilling our objectives and commitments.  

49.  Considering that international migration requires a forum at the global level 

through which Member States can review the implementation progress and guide the 

direction of the work of the United Nations, we decide that:  

 (a)  The High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development, 

currently scheduled to take place every fourth session of the General Assembly, shall 

be repurposed and renamed “International Migration Review Forum”; 

 (b)  The International Migration Review Forum shall serve as the primary 

intergovernmental global platform for Member States to discuss and share progress 

on the implementation of all aspects of the Global Compact, including as it relates to 

the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and with the participation of all 

relevant stakeholders; 

 (c)  The International Migration Review Forum shall take place every four 

years beginning in 2022; 

 (d)  The International Migration Review Forum shall discuss the implementation 

of the Global Compact at the local, national, regional and global leve ls, as well as 

allow for interaction with other relevant stakeholders with a view to building upon 

accomplishments and identifying opportunities for further cooperation;  

 (e)  Each edition of the International Migration Review Forum will result in 

an intergovernmentally agreed Progress Declaration, which may be taken into 

consideration by the high-level political forum on sustainable development.  

50.  Considering that most international migration takes place within regions, we 

invite relevant subregional, regional and cross-regional processes, platforms and 



 
A/73/L.66 

 

35/35 18-21786 

 

organizations, including the United Nations regional economic commissions or 

regional consultative processes, to review the implementation of the Global Compact 

within the respective regions, beginning in 2020, alternating with discussions at the 

global level at a four-year interval, in order to effectively inform each edition of the 

International Migration Review Forum, with the participation of all relevant 

stakeholders. 

51.  We invite the Global Forum on Migration and Development to provide a space 

for annual informal exchange on the implementation of the Global Compact, and to 

report the findings, best practices and innovative approaches to the International 

Migration Review Forum.  

52.  Recognizing the important contributions of State-led initiatives on international 

migration, we invite forums such as the IOM International Dialogue on Migration, 

regional consultative processes and others to contribute to the International Migration 

Review Forum by providing relevant data, evidence, best practices, innovative 

approaches and recommendations as they relate to the implementation of the Global 

Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration.  

53.  We encourage all Member States to develop, as soon as practicable, ambitious 

national responses for the implementation of the Global Compact, and to conduct 

regular and inclusive reviews of progress at the national level, such as through the 

voluntary elaboration and use of a national implementation plan. Such reviews  should 

draw on contributions from all relevant stakeholders, as well as parliaments and local 

authorities, and serve to effectively inform the participation of Member States in the 

International Migration Review Forum and other relevant forums.  

54.  We request the President of the General Assembly to launch and conclude, in 

2019, open, transparent and inclusive intergovernmental consultations to determine 

the precise modalities and organizational aspects of the International Migration 

Review Forums and articulate how the contributions of the regional reviews and other 

relevant processes will inform the Forums, as a means to further strengthen the overall 

effectiveness and consistency of the follow-up and review outlined in the Global 

Compact.
