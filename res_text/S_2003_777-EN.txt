United States of America: draft resolution

The Security Council,

Recalling all its resolutions on the question of Western Sahara, and
reaffirming, in particular, resolution 1429 (2002) of 30 July 2002,

Stressing that in view of lack of progress in the settlement of the dispute over
Western Sahara a political solution is critically needed,

Concerned that this lack of progress continues to cause suffering to the people
of Western Sahara, remains a source of potential instability in the region and
obstructs the economic development of the Maghreb region,

Reaffirming its commitment to assist the parties to achieve a just, lasting and
mutually acceptable political solution, which will provide for the self-determination
of the people of Western Sahara in the context of arrangements consistent with the
principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, and noting the role and
responsibilities of the parties in this respect,

Commending the parties for their continuing commitment to the ceasefire and
welcoming the essential contribution which the United Nations Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) is making in that regard,

Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 23 May 2003
(S/2003/565) and the Peace plan for self-determination of the people of Western
Sahara presented by his Personal Envoy, as well as the responses of the parties and
the neighbouring States,

Acting under Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations,

1. Continues to support strongly the efforts of the Secretary-General and his
Personal Envoy and similarly supports their Peace plan for self-determination of the
people of Western Sahara as an optimum political solution on the basis of agreement
between the two parties;

2. Calls upon the parties to work with the United Nations and with each
other towards acceptance and implementation of the Peace plan;

3. Calls upon all the parties and the States of the region to cooperate fully
with the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy;

4. Reaffirms its call upon the Polisario Front to release without further delay
all remaining prisoners of war in compliance with international humanitarian law,



2

S/2003/777

and its call upon Morocco and the Polisario Front to continue to cooperate with the
International Committee of the Red Cross to resolve the fate of persons who are
unaccounted for since the beginning of the conflict;

5. Reiterates its call upon the parties to collaborate with the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the implementation of confidence-
building measures and continues to urge the international community to provide
generous support to UNHCR and the World Food Programme in order to help them
overcome the deteriorating food situation among the refugees;

6. Decides to extend the mandate of MINURSO until 31 October 2003;

7. Requests that the Secretary-General provide a report on the situation
before the end of the present mandate that contains progress made in the
implementation of the present resolution;

8. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
