including inhuman conditions of detention, public executions, extrajudicial

including fair trial guarantees and an independent judiciary; the imposition of 
the death penalty for political and religious reasons; and the existence of a

Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and sanctions imposed on citizens of 
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea who have been repatriated from 
abroad, leading to punishments of internment, torture, cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or the death penalty, and in this regard urges all States to 
respect the fundamental principle of non-refoulement, to treat those who seek 
refuge humanely and to ensure unhindered access to the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees and his Office, with a view to improving the 
situation of those who seek refuge; 

 (iii) All-pervasive and severe restrictions on the freedoms of thought, 
conscience, religion, opinion and expression, peaceful assembly and

persecution of individuals exercising their freedom of opinion and expression, 
and their families; 

 (iv) Limitations imposed on every person who wishes to move freely within 
the country and travel abroad, including the punishment of those who leave or 
try to leave the country without permission, or their families, as well as 
punishment of persons who are returned by other countries;

severe malnutrition, widespread health problems and other hardship for the 
population in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, in particular for 
persons belonging to vulnerable groups, inter alia, women, children and the 
elderly; 

 (vi) Continuing violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
women, in particular the trafficking of women for the purpose of prostitution 
or forced marriage and the subjection of women to human smuggling, forced 
abortions, gender-based discrimination and violence;

freedoms of persons with disabilities, especially on the use of collective camps 
and of coercive measures that target the rights of persons with disabilities to 
decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children;

association and collective bargaining, the right to strike as defined by the 
obligations of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea under the

prohibition of the economic exploitation of children and of any harmful or 
hazardous work of children as defined by the obligations of the Democratic 
People’s Republic of Korea under the Convention on the Rights of the Child;2

cooperation to him, despite the renewal of the mandate by the Human Rights 
Council in its resolution 7/15; 

 2. Reiterates its very serious concern at unresolved questions of 
international concern relating to the abduction of foreigners in the form of enforced 
disappearance, which violates the human rights of the nationals of other sovereign

People’s Republic of Korea urgently to resolve these questions, including through 
existing channels, in a transparent manner, including by ensuring the immediate 
return of abductees; 

 3. Expresses its very deep concern, while noting the willingness to seek 
humanitarian assistance, at the precarious humanitarian situation in the country, 
compounded by the misallocation of resources away from the satisfaction of basic 
needs and by frequent natural disasters, in particular the prevalence of maternal 
malnutrition and of infant malnutrition, which, despite recent progress, continues to 
affect the physical and mental development of a significant proportion of children, 
and urges the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, in this 
regard, to take preventive and remedial action; 

 4. Commends the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the 
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea for the activities undertaken so far and his

Korea to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, in this 
regard:

Korea are able to return in safety and dignity, are humanely treated and are not 
subjected to any kind of punishment;

of Korea, and to other United Nations human rights mechanisms;

with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and her Office, as
