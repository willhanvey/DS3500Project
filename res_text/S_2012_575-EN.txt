733 (1992), which established an embargo on all delivery of weapons and military 
equipment to Somalia (hereafter referred to as the “Somalia arms embargo”), and 
resolution 2036 (2012), 

 Taking note of the final reports of the Monitoring Group (S/2012/544 and 
S/2012/545) dated 27 June 2012 submitted pursuant to paragraph 6 (m) of resolution 
2002 (2011) and the observations and recommendations contained therein, 

 Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political 
independence and unity of Somalia, Djibouti and Eritrea respectively, 

 Urging the Somali Transitional Federal Institutions (TFIs) and all Roadmap 
signatories to redouble their efforts to fully implement the Roadmap with the 
support of the United Nations Political Office for Somalia (UNPOS) and the 
international community, and reiterating that the Transition will not be extended 
beyond 20 August 2012, in keeping with the Transitional Federal Charter, Djibouti 
Agreement, Kampala Accord, and subsequent consultative meetings, 

 Expressing concern at the continued missing of deadlines in the political 
transition, and noting the primary importance of the transition process, reaffirming 
the importance of preventing further obstacles to the transition process, 

 Condemning flows of weapons and ammunition supplies to and through 
Somalia and Eritrea in violation of the Somalia arms Embargo and the Eritrea arms 
embargo established pursuant to resolution 1907 (2009) (hereafter referred to as the 
“Eritrea arms embargo”), as a serious threat to peace and stability in the region, 

 Deploring all acts of violence, abuses and violations, including sexual and 
gender-based violence, committed against civilians, including children, in violation 
of applicable international law, strongly condemning the recruitment of child 
soldiers, and strongly urging that the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and

recruitment and use of child soldiers, signed on 3 July 2012, and stressing that the 
perpetrators must be brought to justice,

discuss possible steps for clarifying methodological standards for monitoring 
mechanisms, 

 Reaffirming the need for both the Somali authorities and donors to be mutually 
accountable and transparent in the allocation of financial resources, by encouraging 
the application of international standards on fiscal transparency, including through 
the proposed Joint Financial Management Board, in this context expressing concern 
at the worrying reports on financial transparency, 

 Determining that the situation in Somalia, Eritrea’s influence in Somalia, as

that threaten the peace, security or stability of Somalia, including acts that threaten 
the Djibouti Agreement of 18 August 2008 or the political process, or threaten the 
TFIs and their post-transition successors, or the African Union Mission in Somalia 
(AMISOM) by force;

which constitutes financial support for a designated entity;

obligations in delivering services within the framework of the Djibouti Agreement; 

 3. Considers that such acts may also include, but are not limited to, 
engaging in or providing support for acts which obstruct or undermine the transition 
process in Somalia; 

 4. Welcomes the recommendation of the Somalia and Eritrea Monitoring 
Group to set up a Joint Financial Management Board to improve financial 
management, transparency and accountability of Somalia’s public resources, reiterates 
its call for the end of the misappropriation of financial funds and for full cooperation 
in the rapid setting up and effective operation of the Joint Financial Management 
Board, and notes the importance of capacity-building of the relevant Somali 
institutions; 

 5. Underscores the importance of humanitarian aid operations, condemns 
any politicization of humanitarian assistance, or misuse or misappropriation, and

all parties and armed groups to take appropriate steps to ensure the safety and
