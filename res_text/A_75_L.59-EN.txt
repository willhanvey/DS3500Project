well as preventive measures and treatments for communicable and non-communicable 

diseases, in particular those that disproportionately impact developing countries,  

 Reiterating the commitment to the decade of action and delivery for sustainable 

development towards the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda,  

 Welcoming the significant gains achieved in the AIDS response, while noting 

with concern that progress has been uneven among and within countries, and that gains 

remain fragile and reversible without a renewed commitment and accelerated action,  

 Expressing deep concern that, prior to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 

pandemic, the world was not on track to meet the time-bound targets set out in the 

2016 Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS and missed them when they expired at 

the end of 2020, and that the COVID-19 pandemic has created additional setbacks 

and pushed the AIDS response even further off track,  

 Noting that 2021 will mark 40 years since the first case of AIDS was reported 

and 25 years since the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS commenced 

its valuable work, and noting also the ongoing work on a new Global AIDS Strategy 

2021–2026, 

 Recognizing that AIDS remains an urgent global health and development 

challenge, and recognizing also the need to address persistent challenges and gaps in 

the AIDS response, including primary prevention, as well as the impact thereon of the 

COVID-19 pandemic and the underlying inequalities within and among countries on 

which both epidemics thrive, 

 1. Decides to convene a high-level meeting from 8 to 10 June 2021, which 

will undertake a comprehensive review of the progress on the commitments made in

the response, in its social, economic and political dimensions, continues to contribute 

optimally to progress on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the global 

health goal, including successes, best practices, lessons learned, obstacles and gaps, 

challenges and opportunities, including with regard to partnership and cooperation, 

and recommendations to guide and monitor the HIV/AIDS response beyond 2021, 

including new concrete commitments to accelerate action to end the AIDS epidemic 

by 2030 as well as to promote the renewed commitment and engagement of leaders, 

countries, communities and partners to accelerate and implement a comprehensive 

universal and integrated response to HIV/AIDS;
