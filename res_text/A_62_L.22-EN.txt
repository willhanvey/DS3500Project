 Recalling also its resolution 36/120 E of 10 December 1981 and all subsequent

to and residence in East Jerusalem, and the further isolation of the city from the rest 
of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which is having a detrimental effect on the 
lives of Palestinians and could prejudge a final status agreement on Jerusalem,  

 Reaffirming that the international community, through the United Nations, has 
a legitimate interest in the question of the City of Jerusalem and the protection of 
the unique spiritual, religious and cultural dimensions of the city, as foreseen in 
relevant United Nations resolutions on this matter,  

 Having considered the report of the Secretary-General,2  

 1. Reiterates its determination that any actions taken by Israel, the 
occupying Power, to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the Holy 
City of Jerusalem are illegal and therefore null and void and have no validity 
whatsoever, and calls upon Israel to cease all such illegal and unilateral measures;  

 2. Welcomes the decision of those States that had established diplomatic 
missions in Jerusalem to withdraw their missions from the city, in compliance with 
Security Council resolution 478 (1980); 

 3. Stresses that a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the question of 
the City of Jerusalem should take into account the legitimate concerns of both the 
Palestinian and Israeli sides and should include internationally guaranteed 
provisions to ensure the freedom of religion and of conscience of its inhabitants, as 
well as permanent, free and unhindered access to the holy places by the people of all 
religions and nationalities;  

 4. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its 
sixty-third session on the implementation of the present resolution.
