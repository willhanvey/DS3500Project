III. RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SPECIAL POLITICAL AND
      DECOLONIZATION COMMITTEE (FOURTH COMMITTEE) 

11. The Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee)
recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the following draft
resolution:

          Activities of foreign economic and other interests which impede
          the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
          Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in Territories

under colonial domination

The General Assembly,

Having considered the item entitled "Activities of foreign economic and
other interests which impede the implementation of the Declaration on the
Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in Territories under
colonial domination",

Having examined the chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the
Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting
of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples relating to the item, 6/

Recalling its resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, as well as all its
other relevant resolutions, including, in particular, resolution 46/181 of
19 December 1991, endorsing the plan of action for the International Decade for
the Eradication of Colonialism, 7/

Reaffirming the solemn obligation of the administering Powers under the
Charter of the United Nations to promote the political, economic, social and
educational advancement of the inhabitants of the Territories under their
administration and to protect the human and natural resources of those
Territories against abuses,

                        

     6/ A/50/23 (Part III), chap. V.

     7/ See A/46/634/Rev.1 and Corr.1.

/...



A/50/610
English
Page 22

Reaffirming also that any economic or other activity that constitutes an
obstacle to the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and obstructs efforts aimed at
the elimination of colonialism is a direct violation of the rights of the
inhabitants and of the principles of the Charter and all relevant resolutions of
the United Nations,

Reaffirming further that the natural resources are the heritage of the
indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories, 

Aware of the special circumstances of the geographical location, size and
economic conditions of each Territory and bearing in mind the need to promote
economic stability, diversification and strengthening of the respective economy
of each Territory,

Conscious of the particular vulnerability of the small Territories to
natural disasters and environmental degradation,

Conscious also that foreign economic investment when done in collaboration
with the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories and in accordance with
their wishes could make a valid contribution to the socio-economic development
of the Territories and could also make a valid contribution to the exercise of
their rights to self-determination,

Concerned about the activities of those foreign economic, financial and
other interests which exploit the natural and human resources of the
Non-Self-Governing Territories to the detriment of the interests of the
inhabitants of those Territories and deprive them of their right to control the
wealth of their countries,

Bearing in mind the relevant provisions of the final documents of the
successive Conferences of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries
and of the resolutions adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government
of the Organization of African Unity, the South Pacific Forum and the Caribbean
Community,

1. Reaffirms the inalienable right of the peoples of colonial and
Non-Self-Governing Territories to self-determination and independence and to the
enjoyment of the natural resources of their Territories, as well as their right
to dispose of those resources in their best interests;

2. Affirms the value of foreign economic investment undertaken in
collaboration with the people of the Non-Self-Governing Territories and in
accordance with their wishes in order to make a valid contribution to the
socio-economic development of the Territories;

3. Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial
peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate
rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of
those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests, violates the solemn
obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations;

A/50/610

4. Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic,
financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources
that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and
Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean, the Pacific and other regions,
as well as their human resources, to the detriment of their interests, thus
depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and
impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for
self-determination and independence;

5. Reiterates its deep concerns about those activities of foreign
economic and other interests in the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories
which are impeding the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in its resolution
1514 (XV), and the efforts to eliminate colonialism;

6. Calls once again upon all Governments that have not yet done so to
take, in accordance with the relevant provisions of its resolution 2621 (XXV) of
12 October 1970, legislative, administrative or other measures in respect of
their nationals and the bodies corporate under their jurisdiction, if any, that
own and operate enterprises in colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories that
are detrimental to the interests of the inhabitants of those Territories, in
order to put an end to such practices and to prevent new investments that run
counter to the interests of the inhabitants of those Territories;

7. Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine
and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by
foreign economic interests, in violation of the relevant resolutions of the
United Nations, is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those
Territories;

8. Invites all Governments and organizations of the United Nations system
to ensure that the permanent sovereignty of the peoples of colonial and
Non-Self-Governing Territories over their natural resources is fully respected
and safeguarded;

9. Urges the administering Powers concerned to continue to take effective
measures to safeguard and guarantee the inalienable right of the peoples of the
colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories to their natural resources and to
establish and maintain control over the future development of those resources,
and requests the administering Powers to continue to take all necessary steps to

12. The Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) also
recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the following draft decision:

Military activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in
Territories under their administration

1. The General Assembly, having considered the chapter of the report of
the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples
relating to an item on the agenda of the Special Committee entitled "Military
activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their
administration", 8/ and recalling its resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960
and all other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations relating
to military activities in colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories, reaffirms
its strong conviction that military bases and installations in the Territories
concerned could constitute an obstacle to the exercise by the people of those
Territories of their right to self-determination, and reiterates its strong
views that existing bases and installations, which are impeding the
implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples, should be withdrawn.

2. Aware of the presence of such bases and installations in some of those
Territories, the General Assembly urges the administering Powers concerned to
continue to take all necessary measures not to involve those Territories in any
offensive acts or interference against other States.

3. The General Assembly reiterates its concern that military activities
and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their administration
might run counter to the rights and interests of the colonial peoples concerned,

especially their right to self-determination and independence. The Assembly
once again calls upon the administering Powers concerned to terminate such
activities and to eliminate such military bases in compliance with its relevant
resolutions. 

4. The General Assembly reiterates that the colonial and Non-Self-
Governing Territories and areas adjacent thereto should not be used for nuclear
testing, dumping of nuclear wastes or deployment of nuclear and other weapons of
mass destruction.

5. The General Assembly deplores the continued alienation of land in
colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories, particularly in the small island
Territories of the Pacific and Caribbean regions, for military installations. 
The large-scale utilization of the local resources for this purpose could
adversely affect the economic development of the Territories concerned.

6. The General Assembly takes note of the decision of some of the
administering Powers to close or downsize some of those military bases in the
Non-Self-Governing Territories.

7. The General Assembly requests the Secretary-General to continue to
inform world public opinion of those military activities and arrangements in
colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories which constitute an obstacle to the
implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples.

8. The General Assembly requests the Special Committee on the Situation
with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples to continue to examine this
question and to report thereon to the Assembly at its fifty-first session.
