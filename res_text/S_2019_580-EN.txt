to respond to this challenge, in accordance with international law, including by 

promoting international legal cooperation, where relevant, 

 Acknowledging, in this regard, that terrorists can benefit from organized crime, 

whether domestic or transnational, such as the trafficking in arms, drugs, artefacts, 

cultural property and trafficking in persons, as well as the illicit trade in natural 

resources including gold and other precious metals and stones, minerals, charcoal and 

oil, illicit trafficking in wildlife and other crimes that affect the environment, as well 

as from the abuse of legitimate commercial enterprise, non-profit organizations, 

donations, crowdfunding and proceeds of criminal activity, including but not limited 

to kidnapping for ransom, extortion and bank robbery, as well as from transnational 

organized crime at sea, 

 Strongly condemning the continued flow of weapons, including small arms and 

light weapons, military equipment, unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) and their 

components, and improvised explosive device (IED) components to and between ISIL 

(also known as Da’esh), Al-Qaida, their affiliates, and associated groups, illegal 

armed groups and criminals, and encouraging Member States to prevent and disrupt 

procurement networks for such weapons, systems and components between ISIL (also 

known as Da’esh), Al-Qaida and associated individuals, groups, undertakings and 

entities, 

 Emphasizing that the combined presence of terrorism, violent extremism 

conducive to terrorism, and organized crime, whether domestic or transnational, may 

exacerbate conflicts in affected regions, and may contribute to undermining affected 

States, specifically their security, stability, governance, social and economic 

development, and noting that organized criminal groups and terrorists benefiting from 

organized crime, whether domestic or transnational, can, in some cases and in some 

regions, complicate conflict prevention and resolution efforts,  

 Seriously concerned by instances of terrorist groups, including those benefiting 

from organized crime, conducting attacks including those on United Nations 

personnel, 

 Reaffirming its commitment to sovereignty, territorial integrity and political 

independence of all States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, and 

stressing that Member States have the primary responsibility in countering terrorist 

acts and violent extremism conducive to terrorism, 

 Reaffirming that Member States must ensure that any measures taken to counter 

terrorism must comply with all their obligations under international law, in particular 

international human rights law, international refugee law and international 

humanitarian law, underscores that respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms 

and the rule of law are complementary and mutually reinforcing with effective 

counter-terrorism measures and are an essential part of a successful counter-terrorism 

effort, and notes the importance of respect for the rule of law so as to effectively 

prevent and combat terrorism, and further notes that failure to comply with these and 

other international obligations, including under the Charter of the United Nations, is 

one of the factors contributing to increased radicalization to violence and fosters a 

sense of impunity, 

 Underscoring the need of Member States to strengthen, where appropriate, their 

criminal justice, law enforcement and border-control capacities, and to develop their 

capacity to investigate, prosecute, disrupt, and dismantle trafficking networks to 

address the linkages between terrorism and organized crime, whether domestic or 

transnational, 

 Recalling its urge to Member States to fully implement the “Programme of 

Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light 



 
S/2019/580 

 

3/7 19-12419 

 

Weapons in All Its Aspects” and the International Tracing Instrument in order to assist 

in preventing terrorists from acquiring small arms and light weapons, in particular in 

conflict and post-conflict areas, 

 Encouraging Member States to collect relevant information and to further 

identify, analyse and counter any existing, growing or potential links, in some cases, 

between organized crime, whether domestic or transnational, illicit drug-related 

activities, money-laundering and the financing of terrorism, in order to enhance 

criminal justice responses to those crimes, and calling upon the United Nations Office 

on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), within its relevant mandates, to support, upon 

request, the efforts of Member States in that regard,  

 Stressing that the development and maintenance of fair and effective criminal 

justice systems should be a fundamental basis of any strategy to counter terrorism and 

organized crime, whether domestic or transnational,  

 Noting the important contribution that public-private partnerships can make in 

efforts to prevent and combat terrorism, corruption and organized crime, whether 

domestic or transnational, 

 Acknowledging that prisons can serve as potential incubators for radicalization 

to terrorism and terrorist recruitment, and that proper assessment and monitoring of 

persons convicted of terrorist offences is critical to mitigate opportunities for 

terrorists to attract new recruits, recognizing that prisons can also serve to rehabilitate 

and reintegrate prisoners, where appropriate, and also recognizing that Member States 

may need to continue to engage with offenders after release from prison to avoid 

recidivism, in accordance with relevant international law and taking into 

consideration, where appropriate, the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for 

the Treatment of Prisoners, or “Nelson Mandela Rules”, 

 Recalling the importance for Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate (CTED) 

to include in CTED’s country assessments, as appropriate, information regarding 

Member States efforts to address the issue of trafficking in persons and its link with 

sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict situations committed by terrorist groups 

as part of their strategic objectives and ideology, and used as a tactic by certain parties 

to armed conflict, including non-state armed groups designated as terrorist groups,  

 Recalling the Madrid Guiding Principles on Foreign Terrorist Fighters, including 

the recently adopted Addendum, (S/2018/1177), and stressing the importance of full 

and effective implementation of such principles,  

 Noting recent developments and initiatives at the international, regional and 

subregional levels to prevent and suppress international terrorism and organized 

crime, whether domestic or transnational, including the essential role of the Financial 

Action Task Force (FATF) and its Global Network of FATF-style regional bodies, as 

well as the work of the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF), in particular the 

adoption of The Hague Good Practices on the Nexus between Transnational 

Organized Crime and Terrorism, 

 1. Calls upon Member States to enhance coordination of efforts at all levels 

in order to strengthen a global response to linkages between international terrorism 

and organized crime, whether domestic or transnational, which constitute a serious 

challenge and a threat to international security;  

 2. Calls upon Member States to continue to conduct research and collect 

information to enhance knowledge of and better understand the nature and scope of 

the linkages that may exist between terrorism and organized crime, whether domestic 

or transnational, to intensify and accelerate the timely exchange of relevant 

operational information and financial intelligence regarding actions, movements and

S/2019/580 
 

 

19-12419 4/7 

 

patterns of movements of terrorists or terrorist networks, including foreign terrorist 

fighters, in accordance with domestic and international law; 

 3. Further stresses the importance of good governance and the need to fight 

against corruption, money-laundering and terrorist financing, in particular through 

the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational 

Organized Crime (2000), the United Nations Convention against Corruption (2003), 

the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (1999) 

and the comprehensive international standards set forth in the FATF revised Forty 

Recommendations on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism 

and Proliferation, including by adopting and effectively implementing legislative and 

regulatory measures, to enable the competent domestic authorities to freeze or seize, 

confiscate and manage criminal assets, in order to combat illicit finance including 

terrorist financing and money-laundering; 

 4. Calls upon Member States to strengthen their efforts as well as 

international and regional cooperation to counter the threat to the international 

community posed by the illicit cultivation, production, trafficking, and consumption 

of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, which can significantly contribute to 

the financial resources of terrorist groups, and to act in accordance with the principle 

of common and shared responsibility in addressing and countering the world drug 

problem, including through cooperation against the trafficking in illicit drugs and 

precursor chemicals, also underlining the importance of border management 

cooperation, and welcomes in this context the continued efforts of the UNODC;  

 5. Notes with concern that drug traffickers continue to exploit tools of 

modern commerce to traffic in precursors, pre-precursor chemicals and synthetic 

drugs, thereby contributing to the increased misuse of these drugs and the adverse 

consequences of their non-medical use, exploiting, for example, online markets for 

the illicit sale of such synthetic drugs, in particular synthetic opioids, in addition to 

exploiting the international mail system and express consignment carrier shipments 

to distribute such substances; 

 6. Urges all States to ensure that their domestic laws and regulations establish 

serious criminal offenses sufficient to provide the ability to prosecute and penalize in 

a manner duly reflecting the seriousness of the offence of trafficking in persons;  

 7. Calls upon Member States to investigate, disrupt and dismantle organized 

criminal networks involved in trafficking in persons in accordance with national 

legislation, including anti-money-laundering, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws 

and, where appropriate, counter-terrorism laws; 

 8. Further calls upon Member States, where appropriate, to review, amend 

and implement legislation, including for acts of sexual and gender-based violence, to 

ensure that all forms of trafficking in persons, including when it is committed in 

situations of armed conflict or by armed and terrorist groups for the purpose of 

financing terrorism or to serve any strategic goals of terrorist groups are addressed, 

and to consider establishing jurisdiction to end the impunity of offenders;  

 9. Strongly urges all States to implement and strengthen compliance with the 

comprehensive international standards embodied in the revised Forty FATF 

Recommendations on Combating Money Laundering, and the Financing of Terrorism 

and Proliferation and its interpretive notes; and calls upon Member States to increase 

capacity to conduct proactive financial investigations to identify and disrupt 

trafficking in persons and identify potential linkages with terrorism;  

 10. Urges States that have not already done so, in order to prevent terrorists 

from acquiring weapons, to adopt and implement the necessary legislative or other 

measures to establish as criminal offences under their domestic law the following 



 
S/2019/580 

 

5/7 19-12419 

 

illicit activities within their areas of jurisdiction in order to ensure that those engaged 

in such activities can be prosecuted: 

 (a) illegal manufacture, possession, stockpiling and trade of all types of 

explosives, whether military or civilian, as well as other military or civilian materials 

and components that can be used to manufacture improvised explosive devices, 

including detonators, detonating cords and chemical components,  

 (b) trafficking of military and dual-use materials and equipment that could be 

used for the illegal manufacture of arms and armaments, including explosive devices;  

 11. Urges States to adopt legislative and other measures, consistent with 

domestic marking laws and regulations, including criminal measures, to prohibit the 

illegal manufacture of unmarked or inadequately marked small arms and light 

weapons, as well as the illicit falsification, obliteration, removal or alteration of the 

unique markings prescribed in the International Tracing Instrument; 

 12. Further encourages States to promote and strengthen border cooperation 

and regional and subregional coordination, as appropriate, through effective measures 

and enhanced exchange of information, consistent with domestic laws and 

regulations, between law enforcement agencies, customs, and export and import 

licensing authorities, with a view to eradicating and combating the illicit activities 

listed in paragraphs 10 and 11 across borders;  

 13. Expresses concern at the illegal exploitation and trafficking of natural 

resources, such as precious metals and minerals like gold, silver, copper and 

diamonds, as well as timber, charcoal and wildlife, by armed groups, terrorist groups 

and criminal networks supporting them; 

 14. Encourages all States to continue efforts to end the illicit trade in natural 

resources, in particular in the gold sector, and to hold those complicit in the illicit 

trade accountable, as part of broader efforts to ensure that the illicit trade in natural 

resources is not benefiting sanctioned entities, terrorist groups, armed groups or 

criminal networks; 

 15. Calls upon Member States, including through relevant central and 

competent authorities, to: 

 (a) strengthen border management, including by increasing awareness, 

training and capacity of relevant practitioners in border control, including with 

relevant organizations, to investigate and prosecute terrorists and terrorist groups and 

transnational organized criminals working with them, and to effectively identify and 

prevent their movement, 

 (b) consider establishing, in conformity with international law, appropriate 

laws and mechanisms that allow for the broadest possible international cooperation, 

including the appointment of liaison officers, police to police cooperation, the

coordination of cross-border investigations in cases related to the linkages between 

terrorism and organized crime, whether domestic or transnational,  

 (c) implement obligations to collect and analyse Advance Passenger Information 

(API) and develop the ability to collect, process and analyse, in furtherance of 

International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards recommended practices, 

Passenger Name Record (PNR) data and to ensure PNR data is used by and shared 

with competent national authorities, with full respect for human rights and 

fundamental freedoms, which will help security officials make connections between 

individuals associated to organized crime, whether domestic or transnational, and 

terrorists, to stop terrorist travel and prosecute terrorism and organized crime, 



S/2019/580 
 

 

19-12419 6/7 

 

whether domestic or transnational, including by making use of capacity building 

programmes, 

 (d) develop the expertise of their Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) to 

analyse financial intelligence of suspected activity of organized crimes, whether 

domestic or transnational, that support terrorism, including the financing of terrorism, 

and encourages them to work together to develop that capacity, and exchange 

information, in this regard, 

 (e) consider the ratification and implementation of global instruments as well 

as their participation in national, regional and global initiatives that aim to build 

capacity to prevent and counter the illicit trafficking, including through seaports and 

at sea, of natural resources, arms, drugs, artefacts and cultural property, as well as 

trafficking in persons, in order to prevent and counteract the linkages between 

terrorism at sea and organized crime, whether domestic or transnational, 

 (f) enhance, when appropriate, the exchange of information between public 

authorities and relevant private sector entities;  

 16. Urges Member States to ensure that all measures taken to counter terrorism 

comply with their obligations under international law, including international 

humanitarian law, international human rights law and international refugee law, and 

urges states to take into account the potential effects of counterterrorism measures on 

exclusively humanitarian activities, including medical activities, that are carried out 

by impartial humanitarian actors in a manner consistent with international 

humanitarian law; 

 17. Encourages Member States to engage relevant local communities and 

non-governmental actors in developing strategies to counter violent extremism as and 

when conducive to terrorism, as well as strategies to counter organized crime, whether 

domestic or transnational, address the conditions conducive to the spread of violent 

extremism, which can be conducive to terrorism, and organized crime, whether 

domestic or transnational, that may fund terrorism, including by empowering youth, 

families, women, religious, cultural and education leaders, and all other concerned 

groups of civil society; 

 18. Calls on Member States to increase the awareness, training and capacity 

of relevant practitioners in correctional systems on the linkages between terrorism 

and organized crime, whether domestic or transnational, including where perpetrators 

of petty crime may be exploited or recruited by terrorists, as perpetrators of such 

crimes can develop and have actively pursued those linkages and other networks in 

prison settings; 

 19. Further calls on Member States to strengthen the capacity of criminal 

justice systems to combat the linkages, and ensure that investigators, prosecutors and 

legal professionals are trained to recognize such linkages between terrorism and 

organized crime, whether domestic or transnational;  

 20. Encourages Member States to take all appropriate actions to maintain a 

safe and humane environment in prisons, develop tools that can help address 

radicalization to violence and terrorist recruitment, in line with their obligations under 

international law and taking into account, the relevant guidance developed by 

UNODC, and explore ways to prevent, within their prison systems, radicalization to 

violence, and to promote rehabilitation and reintegration of convicted terrorists, as 

well as to impede cooperation and transfer of skills and knowledge between terrorists 

and other criminals, while respecting international human rights law;  

 21. Recognizes the role of regional and subregional organizations and 

mechanisms, consistent with Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations, in 



 
S/2019/580

deepening the assessment of threats in their respective regions, in contributing to the 

effective implementation of Security Council resolutions, in strengthening the 

capacities of Member States, in facilitating technical assistance and information 

sharing, and in contributing to national ownership and disseminating awareness;  

 22. Requests United Nations entities, particularly the United Nations Office 

for Counter Terrorism (UNOCT) and UNODC, as well as other Global Compact 

entities, to continue to provide technical assistance and capacity-building to Member 

States, upon their request, to support them in strengthening their response to linkages 

between international terrorism and organized crime, whether domestic or 

transnational, including by the development of tools that can help address 

radicalization to terrorism in prisons and assess the risks of terrorist recruitment, 

consistent with international law, and encourages the Counter Terrorism Committee 

(CTC), with the support of CTED, to continue working together to facilitate technical 

assistance and capacity building and to raise awareness in this area, in particular by

subregional organizations and working closely, including by sharing information, 

with relevant bilateral and multilateral technical assistance providers;  

 23. Directs the CTC, with the support of the CTED and in coordination with 

other relevant UN entities to continue as appropriate, within their respective 

mandates, to identify and examine Member States efforts in impeding terrorist groups 

from benefitting from organized crime, whether domestic or transnational, with the 

aim of identifying good practices, gaps and vulnerabilities in this field, and, in this 

regard, requests CTED, in accordance with Security Council resolution 2395, and in 

cooperation with the UNOCT and UNODC, to integrate consideration of linkages of 

terrorism and organized crime, whether transnational or domestic, into its country 

assessments and analyses and identify emerging trends and gaps in this regard;  

 24. Encourages Member States to make the best use of INTERPOL policing 

capabilities, including its array of investigative and analytical databases, in order to 

prevent and counter the linkages between terrorism and organized crime, whether 

domestic or transnational; 

 25. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the Security Council, within 

twelve months, a joint report by the UNOCT and UNODC with inputs from the 

relevant entities of the United Nations system, including CTED, the Analytical
