 Reaffirming that regional cooperation plays a fundamental role in promoting 

and protecting human rights and should reinforce universal human rights, as 

contained in international human rights instruments, and their protection,  

 Noting that the developments in the Middle East and North Africa have 

generated growing demand for the services of the Centre, and recognizing that the 

report of the Secretary-General4 indicates that regular budget resources have been 

allocated to reinforce the staffing capacity of the Centre, thus enabling it to better 

respond to training and documentation demands in a more timely and adeq uate 

manner, and to help to fill the gaps in terms of expertise and relevant Arabic -

language training materials, 

 Mindful of the vastness and the diversity of the needs in the field of human 

rights within South-West Asia and the Arab region, and taking into account the need 

for appropriate and sustainable funding of the Centre to fully realize its significant 

function and crucial role in the region, 

 1. Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General;

 2. Notes with appreciation the successful assistance that the Centre has 

provided through human rights capacity-building activities, technical assistance 

programmes and training programmes on combating human trafficking, human 

rights and media, human rights and diplomacy, human rights education and police 

training on human rights, as well as support to national human rights institutions 

and regional consultations on the topics of United Nations human rights 

mechanisms; 

 3. Underlines the Centre’s role as a source for regional expertise and the 

need to meet an increasing number of requests for training and documentation, 

including in the Arabic language; 

 4. Notes that the increasing demand that has been placed on the Centre by 

Member States and other stakeholders reveals a growing recognition of its role and 

impact on strengthening human rights capacities in the region;  

 5. Encourages the continued engagement of the Centre to work with other 

United Nations regional offices to strengthen its work and to avoid duplicatio n; 

 6. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its 

seventieth session a report, in accordance with existing rules and procedures, on the 

implementation of the present resolution.
