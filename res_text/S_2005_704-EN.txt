Annex I
Letter dated 27 October 2005 from the Prime Minister
of Iraq addressed to the President of the Security Council

[Original: Arabic]

Sir,

On 15 December 2005 Iraq voted in a general referendum held at the national
level for the purpose of approving a new Constitution for Iraq. The country thus
took another important step towards building a strong democratic future and
establishing a Government elected in accordance with a permanent Constitution. At
the same time, Iraq is approaching the completion of its political transformation
through the process of electing its future legislative authority and forming a new
Government, which is to take place in December 2005. There still remains an
extensive agenda for reconstruction and political development, the realization of
which will require security and stability.

We are proceeding towards political stability and economic prosperity and
taking fundamental steps towards restoring security and stability. Yet Iraq is still
confronted by forces of terrorism that incorporate foreign elements which carry out
horrific attacks and terrorist acts in an attempt to thwart political and economic
development in Iraq. The Iraqi security forces, which are growing in size, capacity
and experience day by day, need more time to fill out their ranks, fully equip
themselves and complete their training with a view to assuming responsibility for all
security matters and providing adequate security for the Iraqi people. Until such
time as the Iraqi security forces assume full responsibility for Iraq’s security, we
need the continued support of the international community, including the
participation of the Multinational Force, in order to establish lasting peace and
security in Iraq. We understand that the Multinational Force is willing to continue
its efforts. We therefore request the Security Council to extend, for a period of 12
months starting 31 December 2005, the mandate of the Multinational Force, as
provided in Council resolution 1546 (2004), including the tasks and arrangements
specified in the letters annexed thereto, with the proviso that the Council shall
review that mandate upon being so requested by the Government of Iraq or at the
end of a period of eight months from the date of the resolution and declare, in the
extension, that it will terminate the mandate before the expiry of that period should
the Government of Iraq so request.

The Government of Iraq believes that the provisions of resolution 1546 (2004)
relating to the deposit of proceeds into the Development Fund for Iraq and the role
of the International Advisory and Monitoring Board will help to ensure that Iraq’s
natural resources are used for the benefit of the Iraqi people. We understand that the
funds deposited in the Development Fund for Iraq belong to Iraq and will continue
to enjoy the immunities and privileges of the Fund, given the importance of those
terms for the Iraqi people during this critical period. We request the Security
Council to extend the validity of those terms for an additional 12 months and to
review them upon being so requested by the Government of Iraq or at the end of a
period of eight months from the date of the resolution.

The Iraqi people are determined to establish for themselves a stable, peaceful
democracy, which will provide the basis for the establishment of a vibrant economy.

This vision of Iraq’s future can become a reality with the help of the international
community.

It is my understanding that the sponsors intend to have the present letter
annexed to the resolution on Iraq currently being drafted. In the meantime, I should
be grateful if you would have copies of this letter circulated to the members of the
Security Council as soon as possible.

Annex II
Letter dated 29 October 2005 from the Secretary of State
of the United States of America to the President of the
Security Council

Having reviewed the request of the Government of Iraq to extend the mandate
of the Multinational Force (MNF) in Iraq (S/2005/687) and following consultations
with the Government of Iraq, I am writing to confirm, consistent with this request,
that the MNF under unified command stands ready to continue to fulfil its mandate
as set out in Security Council resolution 1546 (2004).

Since the end of the occupation on 28 June 2004, the Government of Iraq and
the MNF have developed an effective and cooperative security partnership to
address the evolving nature of Iraq’s security environment, including the continuing
need to prevent and deter acts of terrorism. This partnership plays a critical role in
the daily efforts to improve security throughout Iraq. In the context of this
partnership, the MNF is prepared to continue to undertake a broad range of tasks to
contribute to the maintenance of security and stability and to ensure force
protection, acting under the authorities set forth in resolution 1546 (2004), including
the tasks and arrangements set out in the letters annexed thereto, and in close
cooperation with the Government of Iraq. The forces that make up the MNF will
remain committed to acting consistently with their obligations under international
law, including the law of armed conflict.

Substantial progress has already been made in helping to build and train the
Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), allowing them to take on increasing security
responsibilities. The Government of Iraq and the MNF are developing a security
plan to set forth the conditions necessary for transfer of security responsibility from
the MNF to the ISF. Conditions permitting, we look forward to notable progress in
the next year. Together, we will build towards the day when the Iraqi forces assume
full responsibility for the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq.

The co-sponsors intend to annex the present letter to the resolution on Iraq
under consideration. In the meantime, I request that you provide copies of the
present letter to members of the Council as quickly as possible.

(Signed) Condoleezza Rice
