III. RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE FIRST COMMITTEE

71. The First Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the
following draft resolutions:

General and complete disarmament

A

Nuclear testing

The General Assembly,

Welcoming the easing of international tension and the strengthening of
trust between States that have prevailed following the end of the cold war,

Reaffirming that the cessation of all nuclear testing will contribute to
the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects, to the process of
nuclear disarmament leading to the ultimate objective of the complete
elimination of nuclear weapons and therefore to the further enhancement of
international peace and security,

Convinced that the cessation of all nuclear testing will provide a
favourable climate for the conclusion of negotiations on a comprehensive
nuclear-test-ban treaty,

Considering that nuclear testing is not consistent with undertakings by the
nuclear-weapon States at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties
to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,

Deeply concerned about the potential negative effects of underground
nuclear testing on health and the environment,

Sharing alarm expressed internationally, regionally and nationally at
recent nuclear tests,

1. Commends those nuclear-weapon States observing nuclear testing
moratoria, and urges them to continue those moratoria pending the entry into
force of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty;

2. Strongly deplores all current nuclear testing;

3. Strongly urges the immediate cessation of all nuclear testing.

Small arms

The General Assembly,

Reaffirming the role of the United Nations in the field of disarmament and
the commitment of Member States to take concrete steps in order to strengthen
that role,

Realizing the urgent need to resolve underlying conflicts, to diminish
tensions and to accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament
under strict and effective international control with a view to maintaining
regional and international peace and security in a world free from the scourge
of war and the burden of armaments,

Reaffirming the inherent right to individual or collective self-defence
recognized in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, which implies
that States also have the right to acquire arms with which to defend themselves,

Reaffirming also the right of self-determination of all peoples, in
particular peoples under colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign
occupation, and the importance of the effective realization of this right, as
enunciated, inter alia, in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action,
adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993, 10/

Realizing that arms obtained through the illicit arms trade are most likely
to be used for violent purposes and that even small arms when so obtained,
directly or indirectly, by terrorist groups, drug traffickers or underground
organizations can pose a danger to regional and international security, and
certainly to the security and political stability of the countries affected,

Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council
entitled "Supplement to an Agenda for Peace", 11/ which stressed the urgent
need for practical disarmament in the context of the conflicts the United
Nations is actually dealing with and of the weapons, most of them light weapons,
that are actually killing people in the hundreds of thousands, 12/ and which
identified light weapons as including, inter alia, small arms and anti-personnel
land-mines,

Recalling its resolution 49/75 G of 15 December 1994, in which it welcomed
the initiative taken by Mali concerning the question of the illicit circulation
of small arms and their collection in the affected States of the Saharo-Sahelian

subregion, as well as the action taken by the Secretary-General in
implementation of this initiative,

Noting the work of the Disarmament Commission on international arms
transfers,

1. Requests the Secretary-General, within the existing resources, to
prepare a report, with the assistance of a panel group of qualified governmental
experts to be nominated by him on the basis of equitable geographical
representation, on:

(a) The types of small arms and light weapons actually being used in
conflicts being dealt with by the United Nations;

(b) The nature and causes of the excessive and destabilizing accumulation
and transfer of small arms and light weapons, including their illicit production
and trade;

(c) The ways and means to prevent and reduce the excessive and
destabilizing accumulation and transfer of small arms and light weapons, in
particular as they cause or exacerbate conflict;

with particular attention to the role of the United Nations in this field and to
the complementary role of regional organizations, and taking into account views
and proposals of Member States and all other relevant information, for
submission to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session;

2. Also requests the Secretary-General to seek the views and proposals of
Member States on the matters mentioned in paragraph 1, to collect all other
relevant information and to make them available for consideration by the panel
of governmental experts referred to in paragraph 1;

3. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-second
session an item entitled "Small arms".

C

Nuclear disarmament with a view to the ultimate
elimination of nuclear weapons

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolution 49/75 H of 15 December 1994,

Recognizing that the end of the cold war has increased the possibility of
freeing the world from the fear of nuclear war,

Appreciating the entry into force of the Treaty on the Reduction and
Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, to which Belarus, Kazakstan, the Russian
Federation, Ukraine and the United States of America are party, and looking
forward to the early entry into force of the Treaty on the Further Reduction and
Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms,

nuclear-test-ban treaty no later than 1996, and utmost restraint that should be
exercised by the nuclear-weapon States pending the entry into force of that
treaty;

(b) The immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a
non-discriminatory and universally applicable convention banning the production
of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices in
accordance with the statement of the Special Coordinator of the Conference on
Disarmament and the mandate contained therein;

(c) The determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and
progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally, with the ultimate goal
of eliminating those weapons, and by all States of general and complete
disarmament under strict and effective international control,

Welcoming positive developments as well as the efforts being made by the
States members of the Conference on Disarmament in the negotiations on a
comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty at the Conference on Disarmament at
Geneva,

Recalling that nuclear non-proliferation and the promotion of nuclear
disarmament are key elements in the maintenance of international peace and
security, which is one of the most important purposes of the United Nations,

subregion,

Aware that the preservation of a balance in the defence capabilities of
States at the lowest level of armaments would contribute to peace and stability
and should be a prime objective of conventional arms control,

Desirous of promoting agreements to strengthen regional peace and security
at the lowest possible level of armaments and military forces,

Believing that militarily significant States, and States with larger
military capabilities, have a special responsibility in promoting such
agreements for regional security,

Believing also that two of the principal objectives of conventional arms
control should be to prevent the possibility of military attack launched by
surprise and to avoid aggression,

1. Decides to give urgent consideration to the issues involved in
conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels;

2. Requests the Conference on Disarmament, as a first step, to consider
the formulation of principles that can serve as a framework for regional
agreements on conventional arms control, and looks forward to a report of the
Conference on this subject;

3. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-first
session the item entitled "Conventional arms control at the regional and
subregional levels".

the process of reducing the number of nuclear weapons and removing such weapons
from a deployed status, and bilateral agreements on the issue of de-targeting
strategic nuclear missiles,

Noting the new climate of relations between the United States of America
and the States of the former Soviet Union, which permits them to intensify their
cooperative efforts to ensure the safety, security and environmentally sound
destruction of nuclear weapons,

Noting also that the Russian Federation and the United States of America
concurred that, once the Treaty on the Further Reduction and Limitation of
Strategic Offensive Arms was ratified, they would proceed to deactivate all
nuclear delivery systems to be reduced under the Treaty by removing their
nuclear warheads or taking other steps to remove them from alert status,

Noting further the agreement between the Russian Federation and the United
States of America to intensify their dialogue to compare conceptual approaches
and to develop concrete steps to adapt the nuclear forces and practices on both
sides to the changed international security situation, including the
possibility, after ratification of the Treaty on the Further Reduction and
Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, of further reductions of and limitations
on remaining nuclear forces,

Taking note of the joint statement of 10 May 1995 between the Russian
Federation and the United States of America on the Treaty on the Limitation of
Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems,

Urging the early ratification of the Treaty on the Further Reduction and
Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms and further intensification of such
efforts to accelerate the implementation of agreements and unilateral decisions

Moratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-mines

The General Assembly,

Recalling with satisfaction its resolutions 49/75 D of 15 December 1994 and
48/75 of 16 December 1993, in which it, inter alia, called upon States to agree
to a moratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-mines that pose grave
dangers to civilian populations, and urged States to implement moratoria on the
export of anti-personnel land-mines,

Also recalling with satisfaction its resolution 49/75 D of
15 December 1994, in which it, inter alia, established as a goal of the
international community the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines,

Noting that, according to the 1994 report of the Secretary-General entitled
"Assistance in mine clearance", 40/ it is estimated that there are more than
110 million land-mines in the ground in more than 60 countries throughout the
world,

Noting also that, according to the same report, the global land-mine crisis
continues to worsen as an estimated 2 to 5 million new land-mines are laid each
year, while only an estimated 100,000 were cleared in 1994,

Expressing deep concern that anti-personnel land-mines kill or maim
hundreds of people every week, mostly innocent and defenceless civilians,
obstruct economic development and reconstruction, and have other severe
consequences for years after emplacement, which include inhibiting the
repatriation of refugees and the return of internally displaced persons,

Gravely concerned with the suffering and casualties caused to
non-combatants as a result of the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate
and irresponsible use, of anti-personnel land-mines,

Recalling with satisfaction its resolutions 48/7 of 19 October 1993 and
49/215 A of 23 December 1994, calling for assistance in mine clearance,

Welcoming the programmes of assistance that exist for demining and
humanitarian support for the victims of anti-personnel land-mines,

Welcoming also the International Meeting on Mine Clearance, held at Geneva
from 5 to 7 July 1995, and noting the statement of the Secretary-General at the
meeting that the international community must take specific and tangible steps
to address the intolerable situation caused by the proliferation of
anti-personnel land-mines throughout the world,

Recalling with satisfaction the report of the Secretary-General concerning
progress on the initiative in resolution 49/75 D, 41/

Convinced that moratoria by States on the export of anti-personnel land-
mines that pose grave dangers to civilian populations are important measures in
helping to reduce substantially the human and economic costs resulting from the
proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of such
devices,

Noting with satisfaction that more than twenty-five States already have
declared moratoria on the export, transfer or sale of anti-personnel land-mines,
with many of these moratoria being declared as a result of the aforementioned
resolutions,

Believing that ongoing efforts to strengthen the Convention on Prohibitions
or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed

to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, 42/ in
particular Protocol II thereto, 43/ are an essential part of the overall
effort to address problems caused by the proliferation, as well as the
indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of anti-personnel land-mines,

Noting the efforts that were made at the Review Conference of the
Convention, held at Vienna in September and October 1995, to strengthen
prohibitions and restrictions in Protocol II governing land-mine use and
transfer, and urging parties to build consensus towards agreement on such
prohibition and restrictions when the Review Conference reconvenes in January
and April 1996,

Believing that, in addition to Protocol II, other measures to control the
production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel land-mines are also
necessary to address problems caused by anti-personnel land-mines, especially
the indiscriminate or illegal use of anti-personnel land-mines that continue to
inflict harm on civilian populations long after emplacement,

Recognizing that States can move most effectively towards the goal of the
eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines as viable alternatives are
developed that significantly reduce the risk to the civilian population, and
emphasizing the need for States to work on developing such alternatives on an
urgent basis,

1. Welcomes the moratoria already declared by certain States on the
export of anti-personnel land-mines;

2. Urges States that have not yet done so to declare such moratoria at
the earliest possible date;

3. Requests the Secretary-General to prepare a report on steps taken by
Member States to implement such moratoria, and to submit it to the General
Assembly at its fifty-first session under the item entitled "General and
complete disarmament";

4. Emphasizes the importance of the Convention on Prohibitions or
Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to
Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects and Protocol II
thereto as the authoritative international instrument governing the responsible
use of anti-personnel land-mines and related devices, and urges parties to build
consensus towards an agreement when the Review Conference reconvenes;

5. Encourages the widest possible accession to the Convention and to
Protocol II thereto, and further urges all States to comply immediately and
fully with the applicable rules of Protocol II;

Nuclear disarmament

The General Assembly,

Reaffirming the commitment of the international community to the goal of
the total elimination of nuclear weapons and the creation of a nuclear-weapon-
free world,

Determined to achieve the objective of prohibiting the development,
production, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons and their destruction, and to
conclude such an international treaty or treaties at an early date,

Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special
Session of the General Assembly, 44/ the first special session devoted to
disarmament, calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation

for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time-frames, wherever
feasible, for progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their
means of delivery, leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the
earliest possible time,

Recognizing that a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty, the proposed
treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive
devices and a convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons constitute
important steps towards the elimination of the nuclear threat, and will
contribute to the achievement of the goal of nuclear disarmament within a time-
bound framework,

Recognizing also that the end of the cold war has brought about favourable
conditions for creating a world free of nuclear weapons,

Welcoming the entry into force of the Treaty on the Reduction and
Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, to which Belarus, Kazakstan, the Russian
Federation, Ukraine and the United States of America are States parties, as well
as the conclusion of the Treaty on the Further Reduction and Limitation of
Strategic Offensive Arms by the Russian Federation and the United States of
America, and looking forward to full implementation of these treaties and to
further concrete steps for nuclear disarmament by all nuclear-weapon States,

Recognizing the complementarity of bilateral and multilateral negotiations
on nuclear disarmament and that bilateral negotiations can never replace
multilateral negotiations in this respect,

Recognizing also that a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty and the
proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive
devices must both constitute disarmament measures and not only non-proliferation
measures, and that they must be important steps leading to the total elimination
of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework,

Noting the support expressed in the Conference on Disarmament and in the
General Assembly for the elaboration of an international convention to assure
non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons,
and the multilateral efforts in the Conference on Disarmament to reach agreement
on such an international convention at an early date,

Recalling its resolution 49/75 E of 15 December 1994 on a step-by-step
reduction of the nuclear threat,

political developments, the time is now opportune for all nuclear-weapon States
to undertake effective nuclear disarmament measures with a view to the total
elimination of these weapons within a time-bound framework;

2. Also recognizes that there is a genuine need to de-emphasize the role
of nuclear weapons, and to review and revise nuclear doctrines accordingly;

3. Urges the nuclear-weapon States to stop immediately the qualitative
improvement, development, stockpiling and production of nuclear warheads and
their delivery systems;

4. Calls upon the nuclear-weapon States to undertake step-by-step
reduction of the nuclear threat and a phased programme of progressive and
balanced deep reductions of nuclear weapons, and to carry out effective nuclear
disarmament measures with a view to the total elimination of these weapons
