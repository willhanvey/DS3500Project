Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty5 to the advancement of nuclear 
disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation objectives, and welcoming the recent 
ratifications of the Treaty by Ghana and Guinea, 

 Reaffirming the conviction that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free 
zones enhances global and regional peace and security, strengthens the nuclear  
non-proliferation regime and contributes towards realizing the objectives of nuclear 
disarmament, 

 Recalling that the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons encouraged the establishment of further 
nuclear-weapon-free zones, on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the

concerted international efforts to create such zones in areas where they do not 
currently exist, especially in the Middle East, 

 Noting with satisfaction the agreement at the 2010 Review Conference of the 
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons on practical steps 
to fully implement the 1995 resolution on the Middle East, 

 Recognizing positive developments in the context of nuclear-weapon-free 
zones, notably the ratification by the Russian Federation of Protocols I and II to the 
Treaty of Pelindaba,6 the submission by the United States of America to the United 
States Senate for advice and consent of the Protocols to the Treaty of Pelindaba and 
the Treaty of Rarotonga,7 the consultations between the Association of Southeast

Nuclear Weapons to both States to continue discussions on follow-on measures in 
order to achieve deeper reductions in their nuclear arsenals,  

 Recalling that the 2010 Review Conference reaffirmed and recognized that the 
total elimination of nuclear weapons is the only absolute guarantee against the use 
or threat of use of nuclear weapons and the legitimate interest of non-nuclear-
weapon States in receiving unequivocal and legally binding security assurances 
from nuclear-weapon States,  

 Deeply disappointed at the absence of progress towards multilateral 
negotiations on nuclear disarmament issues, including in the Conference on 
Disarmament, and underlining the importance of multilateralism in relation to 
nuclear disarmament, while recognizing the value also of bilateral and regional 
initiatives,  

 Mindful that the first meeting of the preparatory process for the 2015 Review 
Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons, to take place in May 2012, will begin to lay the groundwork for 
monitoring the fulfilment by all States parties of their commitments in the 2010 
Review Conference action plan,10 including those by the nuclear-weapon States to 
accelerate concrete progress on the steps leading to nuclear disarmament,  

 1. Reiterates that each article of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of

Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons;4 

 4. Welcomes the expression by the 2010 Review Conference of deep 
concern at the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear 
weapons, as well as its reaffirmation of the need for all States at all times to comply 
with applicable international law, including international humanitarian law;  

 5. Also welcomes the reaffirmation of the continued validity of the practical 
steps agreed to in the final document of the 2000 Review Conference,2 including the 
specific reaffirmation of the unequivocal undertaking of the nuclear-weapon States 
to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear

Pakistan to accede to the Treaty as non-nuclear-weapon States promptly and without 
conditions; 

 10. Urges the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to fulfil the 
commitments under the Six-Party Talks, including those in the September 2005 joint 
statement, to abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes and to 
return, at an early date, to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 
and to its adherence to its International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards 
agreement, with a view to achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in 
a peaceful manner, and reaffirms its firm support for the Six-Party Talks; 

 11. Encourages all States to work together to overcome obstacles within the 
international disarmament machinery, including in the Conference on Disarmament, 
that are inhibiting efforts to advance the cause of nuclear disarmament in a
