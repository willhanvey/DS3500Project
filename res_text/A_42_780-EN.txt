the programme endorsed by the Assembly in paragraph 2 of its resolution

staff of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in
the Nfar East, recognizing that the Agency is doing all it can within the

4. Notes with r~gret that the United Nations Conciliation Commission
for Palestine has been unable t.o find 3 means of aohieving progress in the
implementation of paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (Ill), and
requests the Commission to exert oontinu~ efforts towards the implementation

than 1 September 1988.

5.' Directa attention to the continuing seriousness of tha finanoial
position of the Agency, aa outlined 1n the report of the Commissioner-GeneEall

6. Notes with profound concern that, despite the oomlfiondable arad
successful efforts of the Commissioner-General to oolleot additional
contributions, this increased level of income to the Agenoy i9 still
insufficient to oover essential budget reqUirements in th~ present year an1
that, at currently for~seen levels of giving, defioits will reour eaoh year,

7. Calls upon all Governmenta, 8a a matter of urgenoy, to ~ako the moot
generous efforts possible to meet the antioipated needs of the Aqenoy,
partioularly in the light of the budgetary defioit projeoted in the report of
the Commissioner-General, and therefore urges non-oontributing Governments to
contribute regularly and contributing Governments to oonsider increasing their
regular contributions.
