Recalling also that trade is in many cases the single most important external
source of development financing, and in this context, reiterating the important role
that enhanced market access, balanced rules, appropriate adjustment facility and

programmes can play in the economic development of developing countries,
especially the least developed countries,

knowledge, innovations and practices and, with the approval and involvement of the
holders of such knowledge, innovations and practices, of developing and
implementing benefit-sharing mechanisms on mutually agreed terms for the use of
such knowledge, innovations and practices,

Reaffirming the role of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development as the focal point within the United Nations for the integrated
treatment of trade and development and the interrelated issues in the areas of
finance, technology, investment and sustainable development as reaffirmed by the
São Paulo Consensus,

Noting the significant contribution of the multilateral trading system to
economic growth, development and employment and the importance of maintaining
the process of reform and liberalization of trade policies, and the importance of
rejecting the use of protectionism, so that the system plays its full part in promoting
recovery, growth and development, in particular of developing countries, bearing in
mind paragraph 10 of resolution 55/182,

Taking note of the report of the Trade and Development Board11 and its
statement, as well as the report of the Secretary-General,12

1. Reaffirms the value of multilateralism to the global trading system and
the commitment to achieving a universal, rule-based, open, non-discriminatory and
equitable multilateral trading system that contributes to growth, development and
employment generation, and emphasizes that bilateral and regional trading
arrangements should contribute to the multilateral trading system;

2. Underlines the fact that the increasing interdependence of national
economies in a globalizing world and the emergence of rule-based regimes for
international economic relations have meant that the space for national economic
policy, that is, the scope for domestic policies, especially in the areas of trade,
investment and industrial development, is now often framed by international
disciplines, commitments and global market considerations, that it is for each
Government to evaluate the trade-off between the benefits of accepting international
rules and commitments and the constraints posed by the loss of policy space and
that it is particularly important for developing countries, bearing in mind
development goals and objectives, that all countries take into account the need for
appropriate balance between national policy space and international disciplines and
commitments;

3. Stresses the importance of open, transparent, inclusive democratic and
more orderly processes and procedures for the effective functioning of the
multilateral trading system, including in the decision-making process, so as to
enable developing countries to have their vital interests duly reflected in the
outcome of trade negotiations;

4. Reiterates that development concerns form an integral part of the Doha
Ministerial Declaration,4 and reaffirms the commitments made in the decision of
1 August 2004 of the General Council,5 to fulfil the development dimension of the
Doha Development Agenda,13 which places the needs and interests of developing

countries, especially the least developed among them, at the heart of the Doha work
programme;

5. Expresses its concern over the lack of progress in areas of negotiations of
particular concern to developing countries, which led to missing deadlines provided
in the decision of the General Council of the World Trade Organization;

6. Welcomes the recent aid for trade initiative to address the adjustment
challenges, as well as to build the supply and trade capacities, infrastructure and
institutions of developing countries, and stresses the need for the effective
operationalization with sufficient and additional funding of the initiative to the
benefit of the recipient countries;

7. Reaffirms that all countries have a shared interest in the success of the
Doha work programme, which aims both at further increasing trading opportunities
for developing countries and at making the trading system more conducive to
development, and underscores the need for the major developed countries to make
ambitious proposals in line with their commitments to make progress in all areas of
negotiations, particularly in agriculture, non-agricultural market access, services, the
trade-related intellectual property system and rules as well as operational and
meaningful special and differential treatment for developing countries, and to adopt
practical and concrete solutions to the outstanding implementation-related issues
and concerns raised by developing countries;

8. Calls for the successful and timely conclusion of the negotiations on the
Doha work programme in order to maximize the contribution of the trading system
to raising standards of living, eradicating hunger and poverty, generating
employment and achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including
the Millennium Development Goals, and, in that context, underscores the fact that
enhanced market access for goods and services of export interest to developing
countries as well as strong, special and differential treatment in the outcome of
negotiations in all areas, balanced rules and well-targeted sustainably financed
technical assistance and capacity-building programmes for developing countries are
needed for the realization of the development dimension highlighted in the Doha
work programme, and stresses that the Sixth Ministerial Conference of the World
Trade Organization, to be held in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of
China on 13-18 December 2005, should constitute an important milestone to this
end, and particularly for finalizing the negotiating modalities for successful
conclusion of the Doha round by 2006;

9. Recognizes the need to ensure that the comparative advantage of
developing countries is not undermined by any form of protectionism, including the
arbitrary and abusive use of non-tariff measures, non-trade barriers and other
standards to unfairly restrict the access of developing countries products to
developed countries markets and, in this regard, reaffirms that developing countries
should play an increasing role in the formulation of, inter alia, safety, environment
and health standards, and recognizes also the need to facilitate the increased and
meaningful participation of the developing countries in the work of relevant
international standard-setting organizations;

10. Calls for accelerating the negotiations on the development-related
mandate concerning the Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual



5

A/C.2/60/L.18

Property Rights14 in the Doha Ministerial Declaration, especially the amendments of
the Agreement, in order for intellectual property rules fully to support the objectives
of the Convention on Biological Diversity15 as well as for trade-related aspects of
intellectual property rights and public health to address the problems afflicting many
developing countries, including the least developed countries, especially those
resulting from HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other epidemics;

11. Expresses its concern about the adoption of a number of unilateral
actions that are not consistent with the rules of the World Trade Organization, harm
the exports of all countries, in particular those of developing countries, and have a
considerable bearing on the ongoing World Trade Organization negotiations and on
the achievement and further enhancement of the development dimension of the trade
negotiations;

12. Emphasizes the need for further work to foster greater coherence between
the multilateral trading system and the financial system, and urges the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development, in fulfilment of its mandate, to
undertake the relevant policy analysis in those areas, and to operationalize such
work including through its technical assistance activities;

13. Reaffirms the commitments made at the Fourth Ministerial Conference of
the World Trade Organization4 and at the Third United Nations Conference on the
Least Developed Countries; in this regard calls upon developed countries that have
not already done so to provide immediate bound duty-free, quota-free market access
to all products originating from all least developed countries; also calls upon
developing countries that are in a position to do so to extend duty-free and quota-
free market access to exports of these countries; and in this context reaffirms also
the need to consider additional measures for progressive improvement in market
access for least developed countries;

14. Further reaffirms the commitment to actively pursue the work
programme of the World Trade Organization with respect to addressing the trade-
related issues and concerns affecting the fuller integration of countries with small,
vulnerable economies into the multilateral trading system in a manner
commensurate with their special circumstances and in support of their efforts
towards sustainable development, in accordance with paragraph 35 of the Doha
Ministerial Declaration;

15. Recognizes the special problems and needs of the landlocked developing
countries within a new global framework for transit transport cooperation for
landlocked and transit developing countries, in this regard calls for the full and
effective implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action,8 and stresses the
need for the implementation of the São Paulo Consensus9 adopted at the eleventh
session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in São Paulo,
Brazil, on 18 June 2004, in particular paragraphs 66 and 84 thereof, by the relevant
international organizations and donors in a multi-stakeholder approach;

16. Takes note with satisfaction of the launch of the third round of
negotiations on the Global System of Trade Preferences among Developing

Countries and the progress achieved so far in these negotiations with the aim of
concluding the third round by November 2006;

17. Recognizes the importance of addressing seriously the concerns of
commodity-dependent developing countries, owing to the continuing volatility of
world commodity prices and other factors, and of supporting the efforts of such
countries to restructure, diversify and strengthen the competitiveness of their
commodity sectors, and in this regard notes the formation of an international task
force on commodities by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development;

18. Stresses the importance of facilitating the accession of all developing
countries, in particular the least developed countries, as well as countries with
economies in transition, that apply for membership in the World Trade Organization,
consistent with its criteria, bearing in mind paragraph 21 of resolution 55/182 and
subsequent developments, and calls for the effective and faithful application of the
World Trade Organization guidelines on accession by the least developed countries;

19. Emphasizes the importance of developing human, institutional,
regulatory, research, trade policy and development capacities and infrastructures

20. Invites the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, in
accordance with its mandate, to monitor and assess the evolution of the international

and in particular to analyse issues of concern to developing countries, supporting
them in building capacities to establish their own negotiating priorities and
negotiate trade agreements, including under the Doha work programme;

21. Urges donors, in this regard, to provide the United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development with the increased resources necessary to deliver

enhance their contributions to the trust funds of the Integrated Framework for
Trade-related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries and the Joint
Integrated Technical Assistance Programme;

twelfth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in
