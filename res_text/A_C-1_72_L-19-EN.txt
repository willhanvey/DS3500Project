and 71/54 of 5 December 2016,  

 Reiterating its grave concern at the danger to humanity posed by nuclear 

weapons, which should inform all deliberations, decisions and actions relating to 

nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, 

 Recalling the expression of deep concern by the 2010 Review Conference of 

the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons at the 

catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons, and its 

resolve to seek a safer world for all and to achieve the peace and security of a world 

without nuclear weapons,
1
 

 Noting with satisfaction the renewed attention to the catastrophic humanitarian 

consequences and risks associated with nuclear weapons that has  been generated by 

the international community since 2010 and the growing awareness that these 

concerns should underpin the need for nuclear disarmament and the urgency of 

achieving and maintaining a nuclear-weapon-free world, and noting with 

satisfaction also the prominence accorded to the humanitarian impact of nuclear 

weapons in multilateral disarmament forums,

and developing a greater awareness of the catastrophic consequences of nuclear 

weapon detonations which further reinforce the urgency of nuclear disarmament,  

 Emphasizing the compelling evidence, including that presented at the 

Conferences on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons, that has detailed the 

catastrophic consequences that would result from a nuclear weapon detonation, 

reaching well beyond national borders and also imperilling the achievement of the 

Sustainable Development Goals, the lack of capacity of States and international 

organizations to deal with the aftermath and the risk of an occurrence, due to an 

accident, systems failure or human error,

legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons, leading towards their total 

elimination, pursuant to resolution 71/258 of 23 December 2016,
3
 

 Underlining the importance of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation 

education,  

 Reaffirming that transparency, verifiability and irreversibility are cardinal 

principles applying to nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, which are 

mutually reinforcing processes,

 Recognizing the continued vital importance of the entry into force of the 

Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty
8
 to the advancement of nuclear 

disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation objectives,  

 Recalling that the total elimination of nuclear weapons is the only absolute 

guarantee against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons and the legitimate 

interest of non-nuclear-weapon States in receiving unequivocal and legally binding 

negative security assurances from nuclear-weapon States pending the total 

elimination of nuclear weapons,  

 Reaffirming the conviction that, pending the total elimination of nuclear 

weapons, the establishment and maintenance of nuclear-weapon-free zones 

enhances global and regional peace and security, strengthens the nuclear 

non-proliferation regime and contributes towards realizing the objectives of nuclear 

disarmament, and welcoming the Conferences of States Parties and Signatories to 

Treaties that Establish Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones and Mongolia,  

 Urging States to continue to make real progress towards strengthening all 

existing nuclear-weapon-free zones, inter alia, through the ratification of existing 

treaties and relevant protocols and the withdrawal or revision of any reservations or 

interpretative declarations contrary to the object and purpose of the treaties 

establishing such zones,  

 Recalling the encouragement expressed at the 2010 Review Conference for the 

establishment of further nuclear-weapon-free zones, on the basis of arrangements 

freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned, reaffirming the 

expectation that this will be followed by concerted international efforts to create 

such zones in areas where they do not currently exist, especially in the Middle East, 

in this context noting with deep disappointment the non-fulfilment of the agreement 

at the 2010 Review Conference on practical steps to fully implement the 1995 

resolution on the Middle East, and disappointed that no agreement could be reached 

at the 2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation 

of Nuclear Weapons on this issue,  

 Deeply disappointed at the continued absence of progress towards multilateral 

nuclear disarmament at the Conference on Disarmament, which has been unable for 

the past 21 years to agree upon and implement a programme of work, and 

disappointed that the Disarmament Commission has not produced a substantive 

outcome on nuclear disarmament since 1999,  

 Deeply regretting the lack of any substantive outcome of the 2015 Review 

Conference,  

 Disappointed that the 2015 Review Conference missed an opportunity to 

strengthen the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, enhance 

progress towards its full implementation and universality and monitor the 

implementation of commitments made and actions agreed upon at the 1995, 2000 

and 2010 Review Conferences, and deeply concerned about the impact of this 

failure on the Treaty and the balance between its three pillars,  

 Welcoming the discussions that took place at the first session of the 

Preparatory Committee for the 2020 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty 

on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, held in Vienna from 2 to 12 May 

2017, 

 Encouraging efforts towards the full implementation of the Treaty between the 

Russian Federation and the United States of America on Measures for the Further

all States parties to comply fully with all decisions, resolutions and commitments 

made at the 1995, 2000 and 2010 Review Conferences;  

 2. Also reiterates the deep concern expressed by the 2010 Review 

Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 

Weapons at the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear 

weapons, and the need for all States at all times to comply with applicable 

international law, including international humanitarian law;
1
 

 3. Acknowledges the evidence presented at the Conferences on the 

Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons, and calls upon Member States, in their 

relevant decisions and actions, to give due prominence to the humanitarian 

imperatives that underpin nuclear disarmament and to the urgency of achieving this 

goal;  

 4. Recalls the reaffirmation of the continued validity of the practical steps 

agreed to in the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to 

the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,
9
 including the specific 

reaffirmation of the unequivocal undertaking of the nuclear -weapon States to 

accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear 

disarmament, to which all States parties are committed under article VI of the 

Treaty, recalls the commitment of the nuclear-weapon States to accelerating 

concrete progress on the steps leading to nuclear disarmament, and calls upon the 

nuclear-weapon States to take all steps necessary to accelerate the fulfilment of their 

commitments;  

 5. Calls upon the nuclear-weapon States to fulfil their commitment to 

undertaking further efforts to reduce and ultimately eliminate all types of nuclear 

weapons, deployed and non-deployed, including through unilateral, bilateral, 

regional and multilateral measures;  

 6. Urges all States possessing nuclear weapons to decrease the operational 

readiness of nuclear-weapon systems in a verifiable and transparent manner with a 

view to ensuring that all nuclear weapons are removed from high alert status;  

 7. Encourages the nuclear-weapon States to make concrete reductions in 

the role and significance of nuclear weapons in all military and security concepts, 

doctrines and policies, pending their total elimination;  

 8. Encourages all States that are part of regional alliances that include 

nuclear-weapon States to diminish the role of nuclear weapons in their collective 

security doctrines, pending their total elimination;
