The Security Council,

Taking note of the entry into force on 1 July 2002, of the Statute of the

to facilitate Member States’ ability to contribute to operations established or
authorized by the United Nations Security Council,

Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,

1. Requests, consistent with the provisions of Article 16 of the Rome Statute,

starting 1 July 2002 not commence or proceed with investigation or prosecution of any
such case, unless the Security Council decides otherwise;
