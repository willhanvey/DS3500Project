disarmament, in accordance with commitments made under article VI of the Treaty 
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,4 

 Urging States parties to exert all possible efforts to ensure a successful and 
productive preparatory process for the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the 
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, 

 1. Continues to emphasize the central role of the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons4 and its universality in achieving nuclear 
disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, and calls upon all States parties to 
respect their obligations; 

 2. Reaffirms that the outcome of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties 
to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons3 sets out the agreed 
process for systematic and progressive efforts towards nuclear disarmament; 

 3. Reiterates its call upon the nuclear-weapon States to accelerate the 
implementation of the practical steps towards nuclear disarmament that were agreed 
upon at the 2000 Review Conference, thereby contributing to a safer world for all; 

 4. Calls upon all States to comply fully with all commitments made 
regarding nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation and not to act in any 
way that may compromise either cause or that may lead to a new nuclear arms race; 

 5. Again calls upon all States parties to spare no effort to achieve the 
universality of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and urges 
India, Israel and Pakistan, which are not yet parties to the Treaty, to accede to it as 
non-nuclear-weapon States promptly and without conditions; 

 6. Condemns the announced nuclear-weapon test by the Democratic 
People’s Republic of Korea on 9 October 2006, all nuclear-weapon tests by States 
that are not yet parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 
and any further nuclear-weapon test by any State whatsoever, and urges the 
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to rescind its announced withdrawal from 
the Treaty; 

 7. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-second session 
the item entitled “Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: accelerating the 
implementation of nuclear disarmament commitments” and to review the 
implementation of the present resolution at that session.
