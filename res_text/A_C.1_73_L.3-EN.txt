 The General Assembly, 

 Recognizing the common interest of all mankind in the exploration and use of 

outer space for peaceful purposes, 

 Reaffirming the will of all States that the exploration and use of outer space, 

including the Moon and other celestial bodies, shall be for peaceful purposes and shall 

be carried out for the benefit and in the interest of all countries, ir respective of their 

degree of economic or scientific development,  

 Reaffirming also the provisions of articles III and IV of the Treaty on Principles 

Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, 

including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies,1 

 Recalling the obligation of all States to observe the provisions of the Charter of 

the United Nations regarding the use or threat of use of force in their international 

relations, including in their space activities,  

 Reaffirming paragraph 80 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session 

of the General Assembly,2 in which it is stated that, in order to prevent an arms race 

in outer space, further measures should be taken and appropriate international 

negotiations held in accordance with the spirit of the Treaty, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions on this issue, the most recent of which is 

resolution 72/26 of 4 December 2017, and taking note of the proposals submitted to 

the General Assembly at its tenth special session and at its regular sessions and of the

recommendations made to the competent organs of the United Nations and to the 

Conference on Disarmament, 

 Recognizing that the prevention of an arms race in outer space would avert a  

grave danger for international peace and security,  

 Emphasizing the paramount importance of strict compliance with existing arms 

limitation and disarmament agreements relevant to outer space, including bilateral 

agreements, and with the existing legal regime concerning the use of outer space,  

 Considering that wide participation in the legal regime applicable to outer space 

could contribute to enhancing its effectiveness,  

 Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer 

Space, taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and 

seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms, continued the examination and 

identification of various issues, existing agreements and existing proposals, as well 

as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space, and that 

this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer 

perception of the various positions,  

 Noting also that there were no objections in principle in the Conference on 

Disarmament to the re-establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee, subject to 

re-examination of the mandate contained in the decision of the Conference on 

Disarmament of 13 February 1992,3 

 Emphasizing the mutually complementary nature of bilateral and multilateral 

efforts for the prevention of an arms race in outer space, and hoping that concrete 

results will emerge from those efforts as soon as possible,  

 Convinced that further measures should be examined in the search for effective 

and verifiable bilateral and multilateral agreements in order to prevent an arms race 

in outer space, including the weaponization of outer space,  

 Stressing that the growing use of outer space increases the need for greater 

transparency and better information on the part of the international community,  

 Recalling, in this context, its previous resolutions, in particular resolutions 

45/55 B of 4 December 1990, 47/51 of 9 December 1992 and 48/74 A of 16 December 

1993, in which, inter alia, it reaffirmed the importance of confidence -building 

measures as a means conducive to ensuring the attainment of the objective of the 

prevention of an arms race in outer space,  

 Conscious of the benefits of confidence- and security-building measures in the 

military field, 

 Recognizing that negotiations for the conclusion of an international agreement 

or agreements to prevent an arms race in outer space remain a priority task of the 

Conference on Disarmament and that the concrete proposals on confidence -building 

measures could form an integral part of such agreements,  

 Noting with satisfaction the constructive, structured and focused debate on the 

prevention of an arms race in outer space at the Conference on Disarmament each 

year from 2009 to 2018, 

 Noting the introduction by China and the Russian Federation at the Conference 

on Disarmament of the draft treaty on the prevention of the placement of weapons in

outer space and of the threat or use of force against outer space objects in 2008 and 

the submission of its updated version in 2014,4 

 Taking note of the decision of the Conference on Disarmament to establish for 

its 2009 session a working group to discuss, substantially, without limitation, all 

issues related to the prevention of an arms race in outer space,  and to establish a 

subsidiary body on the prevention of an arms race in outer space for its 2018 session, 

 1. Reaffirms the importance and urgency of preventing an arms race in outer 

space and the readiness of all States to contribute to that common objective, in 

conformity with the provisions of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities 

of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other 

Celestial Bodies;1 

 2. Reaffirms its recognition, as stated in the report of the Ad Hoc Committee 

on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space, that the legal regime applicable 

to outer space by itself does not guarantee the prevention of an arms race in outer 

space, that the regime plays a significant role in the prevention of an arms race in that 

environment, that there is a need to consolidate and reinforce that regime and enhance 

its effectiveness and that it is important to comply strictly with existing agreements, 

both bilateral and multilateral; 

 3. Emphasizes the necessity of further measures with appropriate and 

effective provisions for verification to prevent an arms race in outer space; 

 4. Calls upon all States, in particular those with major space capabilities, to 

contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the 

prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that 

objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining 

international peace and security and promoting international cooperation;  

 5. Reiterates that the Conference on Disarmament, as the sole multilateral 

disarmament negotiating forum, has the primary role in the negotiation of a 

multilateral agreement or agreements, as appropriate, on the prevention of an arms 

race in outer space in all its aspects;  

 6. Invites the Conference on Disarmament to establish a working group under 

its agenda item entitled “Prevention of an arms race in outer space” as early as 

possible; 

 7. Recognizes, in this respect, the growing convergence of views on the 

elaboration of measures designed to strengthen transparency, confidence and security 

in the peaceful uses of outer space;  

 8. Urges States conducting activities in outer space, as well as States 

interested in conducting such activities, to keep the Conference on Disarmament 

informed of the progress of bilateral and multila teral negotiations on the matter, if 

any, so as to facilitate its work; 

 9. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-fourth session 

the item entitled “Prevention of an arms race in outer space”.
