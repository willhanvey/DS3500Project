weapons and on their destruction, and to conclude such an international convention 
at an early date, 

 Recognizing that there now exist conditions for the establishment of a world 
free of nuclear weapons, and stressing the need to take concrete practical steps 
towards achieving this goal, 

 Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special 
Session of the General Assembly,3 the first special session devoted to disarmament, 
calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative 
improvement and development of nuclear-weapon systems, and for a comprehensive 
and phased programme with agreed time frames, wherever feasible, for the 
progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery, 
leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time, 

 Reaffirming the conviction of the States parties to the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons4 that the Treaty is a cornerstone of nuclear 
non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament and the importance of the decision on 
strengthening the review process for the Treaty, the decision on principles and 
objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, the decision on the 
extension of the Treaty and the resolution on the Middle East, adopted by the 1995

Federation9 as a significant step towards reducing their deployed strategic nuclear 
weapons, while calling for further irreversible deep cuts in their nuclear arsenals, 

 Noting with appreciation the unilateral measures taken by the nuclear-weapon 
States for nuclear arms limitation, and encouraging them to take further such 
measures, while reiterating deep concern over the slow pace of progress towards 
nuclear disarmament and the lack of progress by the nuclear-weapon States towards 
accomplishing the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals, 

 Recognizing the complementarity of bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral 
negotiations on nuclear disarmament, and that bilateral negotiations can never 
replace multilateral negotiations in this respect, 

 Noting the support expressed in the Conference on Disarmament and in the 
General Assembly for the elaboration of an international convention to assure 
non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, and 
the multilateral efforts in the Conference on Disarmament to reach agreement on 
such an international convention at an early date, 

 Recalling the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the 
Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, issued on 8 July 1996,10 and 
welcoming the unanimous reaffirmation by all Judges of the Court that there exists 
an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion 
negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and 
effective international control, 

 Mindful of paragraph 98 of the Final Document of the Fifteenth Ministerial 
Conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Tehran from 27 to 
30 July 2008, 

 Recalling paragraph 70 and other relevant recommendations in the Final 
Document of the Fourteenth Conference of Heads of State or Government of 
Non-Aligned Countries, held in Havana on 15 and 16 September 2006,11 calling 
upon the Conference on Disarmament to establish, as soon as possible and as the 
highest priority, an ad hoc committee on nuclear disarmament and to commence 
negotiations on a phased programme for the complete elimination of nuclear 
weapons with a specified time framework, 

 Reaffirming the specific mandate conferred upon the Disarmament 
Commission by the General Assembly, in its decision 52/492 of 8 September 1998, 
to discuss the subject of nuclear disarmament as one of its main substantive agenda 
items, 

 Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration,12 in which Heads of 
State and Government resolved to strive for the elimination of weapons of mass 
destruction, in particular nuclear weapons, and to keep all options open for 
achieving this aim, including the possibility of convening an international 
conference to identify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers,

 Reaffirming that, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, States 
should refrain from the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons in settling their 
disputes in international relations, 

 Seized of the danger of the use of weapons of mass destruction, particularly 
nuclear weapons, in terrorist acts and the urgent need for concerted international 
efforts to control and overcome it, 

 1. Recognizes that the time is now opportune for all the nuclear-weapon 
States to take effective disarmament measures to achieve the total elimination of 
these weapons at the earliest possible time; 

 2. Reaffirms that nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are 
substantively interrelated and mutually reinforcing, that the two processes must go 
hand in hand and that there is a genuine need for a systematic and progressive 
process of nuclear disarmament; 

 3. Welcomes and encourages the efforts to establish new nuclear-weapon-
free zones in different parts of the world on the basis of agreements or arrangements 
freely arrived at among the States of the regions concerned, which is an effective 
measure for limiting the further spread of nuclear weapons geographically and 
contributes to the cause of nuclear disarmament; 

 4. Recognizes that there is a genuine need to diminish the role of nuclear 
weapons in strategic doctrines and security policies to minimize the risk that these 
weapons will ever be used and to facilitate the process of their total elimination; 

 5. Urges the nuclear-weapon States to stop immediately the qualitative 
improvement, development, production and stockpiling of nuclear warheads and 
their delivery systems; 

 6. Also urges the nuclear-weapon States, as an interim measure, to de-alert 
and deactivate immediately their nuclear weapons and to take other concrete 
measures to reduce further the operational status of their nuclear-weapon systems 
while stressing that reductions in deployments and in operational status cannot 
substitute for irreversible cuts in, and the total elimination of, nuclear weapons; 

 7. Reiterates its call upon the nuclear-weapon States to undertake the step-
by-step reduction of the nuclear threat and to carry out effective nuclear 
disarmament measures with a view to achieving the total elimination of these 
weapons with a specified framework of time; 

 8. Calls upon the nuclear-weapon States, pending the achievement of the 
total elimination of nuclear weapons, to agree on an internationally and legally 
binding instrument on a joint undertaking not to be the first to use nuclear weapons, 
and calls upon all States to conclude an internationally and legally binding 
instrument on security assurances of non-use and non-threat of use of nuclear 
weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States; 

 9. Urges the nuclear-weapon States to commence plurilateral negotiations 
among themselves at an appropriate stage on further deep reductions of nuclear 
weapons as an effective measure of nuclear disarmament; 

 10. Underlines the importance of applying the principles of transparency, 
irreversibility and verifiability to the process of nuclear disarmament, and nuclear 
and other related arms control and reduction measures; 



 A/C.1/63/L.14
 

5 08-55469 
 

 11. Underscores the importance of the unequivocal undertaking by the 
nuclear-weapon States, in the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference of 
the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to 
accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear 
disarmament, to which all States parties are committed under article VI of the 
Treaty,13 and the reaffirmation by the States parties that the total elimination of 
nuclear weapons is the only absolute guarantee against the use or threat of use of 
nuclear weapons;14 

 12. Calls for the full and effective implementation of the thirteen practical 
steps for nuclear disarmament contained in the Final Document of the 2000 Review 
Conference;6 

 13. Urges the nuclear-weapon States to carry out further reductions of 
non-strategic nuclear weapons, based on unilateral initiatives and as an integral part 
of the nuclear arms reduction and disarmament process; 

 14. Calls for the immediate commencement of negotiations in the 
Conference on Disarmament on a non-discriminatory, multilateral and 
internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile 
material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of the 
report of the Special Coordinator15 and the mandate contained therein; 

 15. Urges the Conference on Disarmament to agree on a programme of work 
that includes the immediate commencement of negotiations on such a treaty with a 
view to their conclusion within five years; 

 16. Calls for the conclusion of an international legal instrument or 
instruments on adequate security assurances to non-nuclear-weapon States; 

 17. Also calls for the early entry into force and strict observance of the 
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty;7 

 18. Expresses its regret that the 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the 
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was unable to achieve any 
substantive result and that the 2005 World Summit Outcome adopted by the General 
Assembly16 failed to make any reference to nuclear disarmament and nuclear 
non-proliferation; 

 19. Also expresses its regret that the Conference on Disarmament was unable 
to establish an ad hoc committee to deal with nuclear disarmament early in 2008, as 
called for by the General Assembly in its resolution 62/42; 

 20. Reiterates its call upon the Conference on Disarmament to establish, as 
soon as possible and as the highest priority, an ad hoc committee on nuclear 
disarmament early in 2009 and to commence negotiations on a phased programme 
of nuclear disarmament leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons with a 
specified framework of time;
