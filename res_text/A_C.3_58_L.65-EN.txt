Elimination of all forms of religious intolerance

The General Assembly,

Recalling that all States have pledged themselves, under the Charter of the
United Nations, to promote and encourage universal respect for and observance of
human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex,
language or religion,

Reaffirming that discrimination against human beings on the grounds of
religion or belief constitutes an affront to human dignity and a disavowal of the
principles of the Charter,



2

A/C.3/58/L.65

Recalling article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 article 18
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights2 and paragraph 4 of the
United Nations Millennium Declaration,3

Reaffirming its resolution 36/55 of 25 November 1981, by which it proclaimed
the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of
Discrimination based on Religion or Belief,

Noting the provisions of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action
adopted by the World Conference on Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia
and Related Intolerance, held in Durban, South Africa, from 31 August to 8
September 2001,4 aimed at combating religious intolerance,

Emphasizing that the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion and
belief is far-reaching and profound and that it encompasses freedom of thought on
all matters, personal conviction and the commitment to religion or belief, whether
manifested individually or in community with others, and in public or private,

Reaffirming the call, made ten years ago in Vienna at the World Conference on
Human Rights, for all Governments to take all appropriate measures in compliance
with their international obligations and with due regard to their respective legal
systems to counter intolerance and related violence based on religion or belief,
including practices of discrimination against women and the desecration of religious
sites, recognizing that every individual has the right to freedom of thought,
conscience, expression and religion,5

Underlining the important role of education in the promotion of tolerance,
which involves the acceptance of and respect for diversity, and underlining also that
education, in particular at school, should contribute in a meaningful way to
promoting tolerance and the elimination of discrimination based on religion or
belief,

Alarmed that serious instances of intolerance and discrimination on the
grounds of religion or belief, including acts of violence, intimidation and coercion
motivated by religious intolerance, continue to occur in many parts of the world and
threaten the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms,

Profoundly concerned at acts and situations of violence and discrimination
resulting from religious intolerance that affect many women,

Deeply concerned at the overall rise in intolerance and discrimination on the
grounds of religion or belief, including restrictive legislation, administrative
regulations and discriminatory registration and the arbitrary application of these and
other measures,

Recognizing that such intolerance and discrimination frequently manifests
itself through acts of violence against religious minorities in all parts of the world,

Believing that further intensified efforts are therefore required to promote and
protect the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief and to
eliminate all forms of hatred, intolerance and discrimination based on religion or
belief, as emphasized also at the World Conference against Racism, Racial
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance,

1. Reaffirms that freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief is a
human right derived from the inherent dignity of the human person and guaranteed
to all without discrimination;

2. Urges States to ensure that their constitutional and legal systems provide
effective guarantees of freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, including
the provision of effective remedies in cases where the right to freedom of thought,
conscience, religion or belief is violated;

3. Also urges States to ensure, in particular, that no one within their
jurisdiction is, because of their religion or belief, deprived of the right to life, liberty
and security of person, the right to freedom of expression, the right not to be
subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
and the right not to be arbitrarily arrested or detained, and to protect their physical
integrity and bring to justice all perpetrators of violations of these rights;

4. Further urges States, in conformity with international standards of
human rights, to take all necessary action to combat hatred, intolerance and acts of
violence, intimidation and coercion motivated by intolerance based on religion or
belief, with particular regard to persons belonging to religious minorities;

5. Urges States to devote particular attention to combating all practices
motivated by religion or belief which lead, directly or indirectly, to human rights
violations and to discrimination against women;

6. Emphasizes that, as underlined by the Human Rights Committee,
restrictions on the freedom to manifest religion or belief are permitted only if those
limitations that are prescribed by law are necessary to protect public safety, order,
health or morals, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others, and are applied
in a manner that does not vitiate the right to freedom of thought, conscience and
religion;

7. Urges States to ensure that all public officials and civil servants,
including members of law enforcement bodies, the military and educators, in the
course of their official duties, respect different religions and beliefs and do not
discriminate on the grounds of religion or belief and to ensure that all necessary and
appropriate education or training is provided;

8. Calls upon all States to recognize, as provided in the Declaration on the
Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or
Belief,6 the right of all persons to worship or assemble in connection with a religion
or belief and to establish and maintain places for those purposes;

9. Expresses its grave concern at all attacks upon religious places, sites and
shrines, and calls upon all States, in accordance with their national legislation and in
conformity with international human rights standards, to exert their utmost efforts to
ensure that such places, sites and shrines are fully respected and protected and to
take additional measures in cases where they are vulnerable to desecration or
destruction;

10. Recognizes that legislation alone is not enough to prevent violations of
human rights, including the right to freedom of religion or belief, and that the
exercise of tolerance and non-discrimination by persons and groups is necessary for
the full realization of the aims of the Declaration, and in this regard invites States,
religious bodies and civil society to undertake dialogue at all levels to promote
greater tolerance, respect and understanding of freedom of religion or belief and to
encourage and promote, through the educational system and by other means,
understanding, tolerance and respect in matters relating to freedom of religion or
belief;

11. Emphasizes the importance of a continued and strengthened dialogue
among religions or beliefs, including as encompassed in the dialogue among
civilizations, to promote greater tolerance, respect and mutual understanding;

12. Takes note with appreciation of the interim report of the Special
Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on freedom of religion or belief7
and encourages his continued efforts to examine incidents and governmental actions
in all parts of the world that are incompatible with the provisions of the Declaration
and to recommend remedial measures as appropriate;

13. Urges all States to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur, including
by considering favourably his requests to visit their countries so as to enable him to
fulfil his mandate even more effectively, welcomes the initiatives of States to
collaborate with the Special Rapporteur, and encourages civil society to continue its
active collaboration with the Special Rapporteur;

14. Urges States to make all appropriate efforts to encourage those engaged
in education to cultivate respect for all religions or beliefs, thereby promoting
mutual understanding and tolerance;

15. Encourages Governments, when seeking the assistance of the United
Nations Programme of Advisory Services and Technical Assistance in the Field of
Human Rights, to consider, where appropriate, including requests for assistance in
the field of the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of thought,
conscience, religion or belief;

16. Welcomes and encourages the continuing efforts of non-governmental
organizations and religious bodies and groups to promote the implementation and
dissemination of the Declaration, and further encourages their work in relation to
promoting freedom of religion or belief and in highlighting cases of religious
intolerance, discrimination and persecution;

17. Requests the Commission on Human Rights to continue its consideration
of measures to implement the Declaration;

18. Requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the Special Rapporteur
receives the necessary resources to enable him to discharge his mandate fully;

19. Decides to consider the question of the elimination of all forms of
religious intolerance at its fifty-ninth session under the item entitled “Human rights
questions”, and requests the Special Rapporteur to submit an interim report to the
General Assembly on the item.
