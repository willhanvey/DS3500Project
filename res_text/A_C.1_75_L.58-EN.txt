 The General Assembly,

measure, and convinced that this is a meaningful step in the realization of a systematic 

process for achieving nuclear disarmament,

General Assembly by its resolution 50/245 of 10 September 1996, was opened for 

signature on 24 September 1996,  

 Stressing that a universal and effectively verifiable Treaty constitutes a 

fundamental instrument in the field of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and 

will be a major contribution to international peace and security,  

 Stressing also the vital importance and urgency of achieving the entry into force 

of the Treaty, and affirming its resolute determination, 24 years after the Treaty was 

opened for signature, to achieve its entry into force,  

 Encouraged by the signing of the Treaty by 184 States, including 41 of the 44

the Treaty by 168 States, including 36 of the 44 whose ratification is needed for its 

entry into force, among which there are 3 nuclear-weapon States,

 Recalling also the adoption by consensus of the conclusions and 

recommendations for follow-on actions of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties 

to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,1 in which the Conference, 

inter alia, reaffirmed the vital importance of the entry into force of the Comprehensive 

Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as a core element of the international nuclear disarmament 

and non-proliferation regime and included specific actions to be taken in support of 

the entry into force of the Treaty,  

 Recalling the Final Declaration adopted by the eleventh Conference on 

Facilitating the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, held 

in New York on 25 September 2019, convened pursuant to article XIV of the Treaty, 

and welcoming the message issued by the Friends of the Comprehensive Nuclear-

Test-Ban Treaty on 1 October 2020, 

 Noting the contribution of diverse and inclusive participation in building and 

sustaining momentum for the universalization and entry into force of the Treaty, 

including through the Youth Group of the Preparatory Commission for the 

Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization,  

 Welcoming continuing progress in the development of the Treaty’s verification 

regime, which advances the Treaty’s primary non-proliferation and disarmament 

objective, and the establishment of 300 certified facilities of the International 

Monitoring System network,  

 Recognizing the civil and scientific benefits provided by the Treaty’s global 

monitoring system,  

 Commending the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-

Ban Treaty Organization for maintaining its vital operations, including that of the 

International Monitoring System and the International Data Centre, during the 

coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, 

 1. Stresses the vital importance and urgency of signature and ratification, 

without delay and without conditions, in order to achieve the earliest entry into force 

of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty;2 

 2. Welcomes the contributions by the signatory States to the work of the 

Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization,

capable of meeting the verification requirements of the Treaty upon its entry into 

force, in accordance with article IV of the Treaty, and encourages their continuation;  

 3. Underlines the need to maintain momentum towards the completion of all 

elements of the verification regime;  

 4. Urges all States not to carry out nuclear-weapon test explosions or any 

other nuclear explosions, to maintain their moratoriums in this regard and to refrain 

from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of the Treaty, while stressing that 

these measures do not have the same permanent and legally binding effect as the entry 

into force of the Treaty;  

 5. Reiterates its condemnation of the six nuclear tests conducted by the 

Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in violation of relevant Security Council
