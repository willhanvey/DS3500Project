First Committee
Agenda item 97
General and complete disarmament

Albania, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, United States
of America and Zambia: revised draft resolution

Compliance with non-proliferation, arms limitation
and disarmament agreements

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolution 57/86 of 22 November 2002 and other relevant
resolutions on the question,

Recognizing the abiding concern of all Member States for maintaining respect
for the rights and obligations arising from treaties to which they are parties and
other sources of international law,

Convinced that observance by Member States of the Charter of the United
Nations and compliance with non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament
agreements to which they are parties and with other agreed obligations are essential
for regional and global security and stability,

Stressing that failure by States parties to comply with such agreements and
other agreed obligations not only adversely affects the security of States parties but
can also create security risks for other States relying on the constraints and
commitments stipulated in those agreements,

Stressing also that the viability and effectiveness of non-proliferation, arms
limitation and disarmament agreements and other agreed obligations require that
those agreements be fully complied with,

Concerned by non-compliance by some States with their respective
obligations,

Noting that verification and compliance, and enforcement in a manner
consistent with the Charter, are integrally related,

* Reissued for technical reasons.

A/C.1/60/L.1/Rev.1

Recognizing that full compliance by States with their respective non-
proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament agreements and other agreed
obligations contributes to efforts to prevent the development and proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and their technologies and means of delivery contrary
to international obligations, and to efforts to deny non-State actors access to such
capabilities,

1. Underscores the contribution that compliance with non-proliferation,
arms limitation and disarmament agreements and other agreed obligations makes to
enhancing confidence and strengthening security and stability;

2. Urges all States to implement and to comply fully with their respective
obligations;

3. Urges those States not currently in compliance with their respective
obligations to make the strategic decision to come back into compliance with those
obligations;

4. Calls upon all Member States to take concerted action in a manner
consistent with relevant international law to encourage, through bilateral and
multilateral means, the compliance by all States with their respective non-
proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament agreements and other agreed
obligations and to hold those not in compliance with such agreements accountable
for their non-compliance in a manner consistent with the Charter of the United
Nations;

5. Encourages efforts by all States parties, the United Nations and other
international organizations, pursuant to their mandates, to take action, consistent
with the Charter of the United Nations, to prevent serious damage to international
security and stability arising from non-compliance by States with their existing non-
proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament obligations;

6. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
