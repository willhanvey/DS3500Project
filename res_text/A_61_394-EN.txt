these problems and, therefore, should have the possibility to participate in the 
negotiations that arise to tackle them, 

 Bearing in mind the existence of a broad structure of disarmament and arms 
regulation agreements resulting from non-discriminatory and transparent 
multilateral negotiations with the participation of a large number of countries, 
regardless of their size and power,

proliferation and disarmament on the basis of universal, multilateral, non-
discriminatory and transparent negotiations with the goal of reaching general and

priority, 

 Considering that the multilateral disarmament agreements provide the 
mechanism for States parties to consult one another and to cooperate in solving any

be undertaken through appropriate international procedures within the framework of 
the United Nations and in accordance with the Charter,

dialogue and confidence-building measures would contribute essentially to the 
creation of multilateral and bilateral friendly relations among peoples and nations, 

 Being concerned at the continuous erosion of multilateralism in the field of 
arms regulation, non-proliferation and disarmament, and recognizing that a resort to 
unilateral actions by Member States in resolving their security concerns would

multilateralism in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation, and underlined the 
fact that multilateralism and multilaterally agreed solutions, in accordance with the 
Charter, provide the only sustainable method of addressing disarmament and 
international security issues,

regulation and disarmament, which constitute an expression of the results of 
international cooperation and multilateral negotiations in response to the challenges 
facing mankind; 

 5. Calls once again upon all Member States to renew and fulfil their 
individual and collective commitments to multilateral cooperation as an important 
means of pursuing and achieving their common objectives in the area of 
disarmament and non-proliferation; 

 6. Requests the States parties to the relevant instruments on weapons of 
mass destruction to consult and cooperate among themselves in resolving their 
concerns with regard to cases of non-compliance as well as on implementation, in 



A/61/394  
 

06-54756 50 
 

accordance with the procedures defined in those instruments, and to refrain from 
resorting or threatening to resort to unilateral actions or directing unverified non-
compliance accusations against one another to resolve their concerns; 

 7. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General containing the replies of 
Member States on the promotion of multilateralism in the area of disarmament and 
non-proliferation, submitted pursuant to resolution 60/59;2  

 8. Requests the Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States on 
the issue of the promotion of multilateralism in the area of disarmament and 
non-proliferation and to submit a report thereon to the General Assembly at its 
sixty-second session; 

 9. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-second session

  Draft resolution XVII 
Transparency and confidence-building measures in outer  
space activities 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 60/66 of 8 December 2005, 

 Reaffirming that the prevention of an arms race in outer space would avert a 
grave danger to international peace and security, 

 Conscious that further measures should be examined in the search for 
agreements to prevent an arms race in outer space, including the weaponization of 
outer space, 

 Recalling, in this context, its previous resolutions, including resolutions 45/55 
B of 4 December 1990 and 48/74 B of 16 December 1993, which, inter alia, 
emphasize the need for increased transparency and confirm the importance of

  Draft resolution XVIII 
Consolidation of peace through practical disarmament measures 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 51/45 N of 10 December 1996, 52/38 G of 
9 December 1997, 53/77 M of 4 December 1998, 54/54 H of 1 December 1999, 
55/33 G of 20 November 2000, 56/24 P of 29 November 2001 and 57/81 of 
22 November 2002, its decision 58/519 of 8 December 2003 and its resolution 59/82 
of 3 December 2004 entitled “Consolidation of peace through practical disarmament 
measures”, 

 Convinced that a comprehensive and integrated approach towards certain 
practical disarmament measures often is a prerequisite to maintaining and 
consolidating peace and security and thus provides a basis for effective post-conflict 
peacebuilding; such measures include collection and responsible disposal, 
preferably through destruction, of weapons obtained through illicit trafficking or 
illicit manufacture as well as of weapons and ammunition declared by competent 
national authorities to be surplus to requirements, particularly with regard to small 
arms and light weapons, unless another form of disposition or use has been 
officially authorized and provided that such weapons have been duly marked and 
registered; confidence-building measures; disarmament, demobilization and 
reintegration of former combatants; demining; and conversion, 

 Noting with satisfaction that the international community is more than ever 
aware of the importance of such practical disarmament measures, especially with 
regard to the growing problems arising from the excessive accumulation and 
uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons, including their ammunition, 
which pose a threat to peace and security and reduce the prospects for economic 
development in many regions, particularly in post-conflict situations, 

 Stressing that further efforts are needed in order to develop and effectively 
implement programmes of practical disarmament in affected areas as part of 
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration measures so as to complement, on a 
case-by-case basis, peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts, 

 Taking note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General on 
prevention of armed conflict,1 which, inter alia, refers to the role which the 
proliferation and the illicit transfer of small arms and light weapons play in the 
context of the build-up and sustaining of conflicts, 

 Taking note of the statement by the President of the Security Council of 
31 August 20012 underlining the importance of practical disarmament measures in 
the context of armed conflicts, and, with regard to disarmament, demobilization and 
reintegration programmes, emphasizing the importance of measures to contain the 
security risks stemming from the use of illicit small arms and light weapons, 

 Taking note also of the report of the Secretary-General prepared with the 
assistance of the Group of Governmental Experts on Small Arms3 and, in particular,

well as the report of the Open-ended Working Group to Negotiate an International 
Instrument to Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely and Reliable Manner, 
Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons,6  

 1. Stresses the particular relevance of the “Guidelines on conventional arms 
control/limitation and disarmament, with particular emphasis on consolidation of 
peace in the context of General Assembly resolution 51/45 N”, adopted by the 
Disarmament Commission by consensus at its 1999 substantive session;7  

 2. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the consolidation of 
peace through practical disarmament measures, submitted pursuant to resolution 
59/82,3 and once again encourages Member States as well as regional arrangements 
and agencies to lend their support to the implementation of recommendations 
contained therein; 

 3. Emphasizes the importance of including in United Nations-mandated 
peacekeeping missions, as appropriate and with the consent of the host State, 
practical disarmament measures aimed at addressing the problem of the illicit trade 
in small arms and light weapons in conjunction with disarmament, demobilization 
and reintegration programmes aimed at former combatants, with a view to 
promoting an integrated comprehensive and effective weapons management strategy 
that would contribute to a sustainable peacebuilding process; 

 4. Welcomes the activities undertaken by the Group of Interested States, and 
invites the Group to continue to promote, on the basis of lessons learned from 
previous disarmament and peacebuilding projects, new practical disarmament 
measures to consolidate peace, especially as undertaken or designed by affected 
States themselves, regional and subregional organizations as well as United Nations 
agencies; 

 5. Encourages Member States, including the Group of Interested States, to 
continue to lend their support to the Secretary-General, relevant international, 
regional and subregional organizations, in accordance with Chapter VIII of the

world, 

 Bearing in mind that the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, 
Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and 
on Their Destruction of 19721 and the Convention on the Prohibition of the 
Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their 
Destruction of 19932 have already established legal regimes on the complete 
prohibition of biological and chemical weapons, respectively, and determined to 
achieve a nuclear weapons convention on the prohibition of the development, 
testing, production, stockpiling, loan, transfer, use and threat of use of nuclear 
weapons and on their destruction, and to conclude such an international convention

Offensive Reductions (“the Moscow Treaty”) between the United States of America 
and the Russian Federation9 as a significant step towards reducing their deployed 
strategic nuclear weapons, while calling for further irreversible deep cuts in their 
nuclear arsenals, 

 Noting with appreciation further the unilateral measures taken by the nuclear-
weapon States for nuclear arms limitation, and encouraging them to take further 
such measures, 

 Recognizing the complementarity of bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral 
negotiations on nuclear disarmament, and that bilateral negotiations can never 
replace multilateral negotiations in this respect,

General Assembly for the elaboration of an international convention to assure non-
nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, and the 
multilateral efforts in the Conference on Disarmament to reach agreement on such 
an international convention at an early date, 

 Recalling the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the 
Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, issued on 8 July 1996,10 and

items, 

 Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration,13 in which Heads of 
State and Government resolved to strive for the elimination of weapons of mass 
destruction, in particular nuclear weapons, and to keep all options open for 
achieving this aim, including the possibility of convening an international 
conference to identify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers, 

 Reaffirming that, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, States 
should refrain from the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons in settling their 
disputes in international relations,

opportune for all the nuclear-weapon States to take effective disarmament measures 
with a view to achieving the elimination of these weapons; 

 2. Reaffirms that nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are 
substantively interrelated and mutually reinforcing, that the two processes must go 
hand in hand and that there is a genuine need for a systematic and progressive 
process of nuclear disarmament; 

 3. Welcomes and encourages the efforts to establish new nuclear-weapon-
free zones in different parts of the world on the basis of agreements or arrangements 
freely arrived at among the States of the regions concerned, which is an effective 
measure for limiting the further spread of nuclear weapons geographically and 
contributes to the cause of nuclear disarmament; 

 4. Recognizes that there is a genuine need to diminish the role of nuclear 
weapons in strategic doctrines and security policies to minimize the risk that these

situation, 

 Convinced that the relationship between the development of confidence-
building measures in the field of conventional arms and the international security 
environment can also be mutually reinforcing, 

 Considering the important role that confidence-building measures in the field 
of conventional arms can also play in creating favourable conditions for progress in 
the field of disarmament,

  Draft resolution XXII 
Regional disarmament 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 45/58 P of 4 December 1990, 46/36 I of 6 December 
1991, 47/52 J of 9 December 1992, 48/75 I of 16 December 1993, 49/75 N of

22 November 2002, 58/38 of 8 December 2003, 59/89 of 3 December 2004 and 
60/63 of 8 December 2005 on regional disarmament, 

 Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the 
ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire 
for genuine peace and security, the elimination of the danger of war and the release 
of economic, intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits, 

 Affirming the abiding commitment of all States to the purposes and principles 
enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations in the conduct of their international 
relations, 

 Noting that essential guidelines for progress towards general and complete 
disarmament were adopted at the tenth special session of the General Assembly,1  

 Taking note of the guidelines and recommendations for regional approaches to 
disarmament within the context of global security adopted by the Disarmament 
Commission at its 1993 substantive session,2  

 Welcoming the prospects of genuine progress in the field of disarmament 
engendered in recent years as a result of negotiations between the two super-Powers, 

 Taking note of the recent proposals for disarmament at the regional and 
subregional levels, 

 Recognizing the importance of confidence-building measures for regional and 
international peace and security, 

 Convinced that endeavours by countries to promote regional disarmament, 
taking into account the specific characteristics of each region and in accordance 
with the principle of undiminished security at the lowest level of armaments, would 
enhance the security of all States and would thus contribute to international peace 
and security by reducing the risk of regional conflicts, 

 1. Stresses that sustained efforts are needed, within the framework of the 
Conference on Disarmament and under the umbrella of the United Nations, to make 
progress on the entire range of disarmament issues; 

 2. Affirms that global and regional approaches to disarmament complement 
each other and should therefore be pursued simultaneously to promote regional and 
international peace and security;

  Draft resolution XXIII 
Confidence-building measures in the regional and  
subregional context 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Guided by the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United 
Nations,  

 Recalling its resolutions 58/43 of 8 December 2003, 59/87 of 3 December 
2004 and 60/64 of 8 December 2005,  

 Recalling also its resolution 57/337 of 3 July 2003 entitled “Prevention of 
armed conflict”, in which it calls upon Member States to settle their disputes by 
peaceful means, as set out in Chapter VI of the Charter, inter alia, by any procedures 
adopted by the parties,  

 Recalling further the resolutions and guidelines adopted by consensus by the 
General Assembly and the Disarmament Commission relating to confidence-
building measures and their implantation at the global, regional and subregional 
levels,  

 Considering the importance and effectiveness of confidence-building measures 
taken at the initiative and with the agreement of all States concerned and taking into 
account the specific characteristics of each region, since such measures can 
contribute to regional stability, 

 Convinced that resources released by disarmament, including regional 
disarmament, can be devoted to economic and social development and to the 
protection of the environment for the benefit of all peoples, in particular those of the 
developing countries, 

 Recognizing the need for meaningful dialogue among States concerned to avert 
conflict, 

 Welcoming the peace processes already initiated by States concerned to resolve 
their disputes through peaceful means bilaterally or through mediation, inter alia, by 
third parties, regional organizations or the United Nations, 

 Recognizing that States in some regions have already taken steps towards 
confidence-building measures at the bilateral, subregional and regional levels in the 
political and military fields, including arms control and disarmament, and noting 
that such confidence-building measures have improved peace and security in those 
regions and contributed to progress in the socio-economic conditions of their 
people, 

 Concerned that the continuation of disputes among States, particularly in the 
absence of an effective mechanism to resolve them through peaceful means, may 
contribute to the arms race and endanger the maintenance of international peace and 
security and the efforts of the international community to promote arms control and 
disarmament, 

 1. Calls upon Member States to refrain from the use or threat of use of force 
in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations; 



 A/61/394

 

93 06-54756 
 

 2. Reaffirms its commitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes under

may hinder or impair such a dialogue; 

 5. Urges States to comply strictly with all bilateral, regional and 
international agreements, including arms control and disarmament agreements, to 
which they are party; 

 6. Emphasizes that the objective of confidence-building measures should be 
to help strengthen international peace and security and be consistent with the 
principle of undiminished security at the lowest level of armaments; 

 7. Encourages the promotion of bilateral and regional confidence-building 
measures, with the consent and participation of the parties concerned, to avoid 
conflict and prevent the unintended and accidental outbreak of hostilities;

Assembly at its sixty-second session containing the views of Member States on 
confidence-building measures in the regional and subregional context;

  Draft resolution XXIV 
Conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 48/75 J of 16 December 1993, 49/75 O of 
15 December 1994, 50/70 L of 12 December 1995, 51/45 Q of 10 December 1996, 
52/38 Q of 9 December 1997, 53/77 P of 4 December 1998, 54/54 M of 1 December 
1999, 55/33 P of 20 November 2000, 56/24 I of 29 November 2001, 57/77 of 
22 November 2002, 58/39 of 8 December 2003, 59/88 of 3 December 2004 and 
60/75 of 8 December 2005, 

 Recognizing the crucial role of conventional arms control in promoting 
regional and international peace and security, 

 Convinced that conventional arms control needs to be pursued primarily in the 
regional and subregional contexts since most threats to peace and security in the 
post-cold-war era arise mainly among States located in the same region or 
subregion, 

 Aware that the preservation of a balance in the defence capabilities of States at 
the lowest level of armaments would contribute to peace and stability and should be 
a prime objective of conventional arms control, 

 Desirous of promoting agreements to strengthen regional peace and security at 
the lowest possible level of armaments and military forces, 

 Noting with particular interest the initiatives taken in this regard in different 
regions of the world, in particular the commencement of consultations among a 
number of Latin American countries and the proposals for conventional arms control 
made in the context of South Asia, and recognizing, in the context of this subject, 
the relevance and value of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe,1 
which is a cornerstone of European security, 

 Believing that militarily significant States and States with larger military 
capabilities have a special responsibility in promoting such agreements for regional 
security, 

 Believing also that an important objective of conventional arms control in 
regions of tension should be to prevent the possibility of military attack launched by 
surprise and to avoid aggression, 

 1. Decides to give urgent consideration to the issues involved in 
conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels; 

 2. Requests the Conference on Disarmament to consider the formulation of 
principles that can serve as a framework for regional agreements on conventional 
arms control, and looks forward to a report of the Conference on this subject; 

 3. Requests the Secretary-General, in the meantime, to seek the views of 
Member States on the subject and to submit a report to the General Assembly at its 
sixty-second session; 

 4. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-second session 
the item entitled “Conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels”.

of 3 December 2004 and 60/76 of 8 December 2005, 

 Convinced that the continuing existence of nuclear weapons poses a threat to 
all humanity and that their use would have catastrophic consequences for all life on 
Earth, and recognizing that the only defence against a nuclear catastrophe is the 
total elimination of nuclear weapons and the certainty that they will never be 
produced again, 

 Reaffirming the commitment of the international community to the goal of the 
total elimination of nuclear weapons and the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free world, 

 Mindful of the solemn obligations of States parties, undertaken in article VI of 
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,1 particularly to pursue 
negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear-
arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, 

 Recalling the principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and 
disarmament adopted at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to 
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,2  

 Emphasizing the unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon States to 
accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear 
disarmament, adopted at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on 
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,3

 Emphasizing the need for the Conference on Disarmament to commence 
negotiations on a phased programme for the complete elimination of nuclear 
weapons with a specified framework of time, 

 Expressing its regret over the failure of the 2005 Review Conference of the 
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to reach 
agreement on any substantive issues,

the thirteen steps to implement article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons agreed to at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the 
Treaty,10  

 Desiring to achieve the objective of a legally binding prohibition of the 
development, production, testing, deployment, stockpiling, threat or use of nuclear 
weapons and their destruction under effective international control, 

 Recalling the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the 
Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, issued on 8 July 1996,11

reinforcing steps are necessary to contribute to the improvement in the international 
climate for negotiations leading to the elimination of nuclear weapons, 

 Mindful that a diminishing role for nuclear weapons in the security policies of 
nuclear-weapon States would positively impact on international peace and security 
and improve the conditions for the further reduction and the elimination of nuclear 
weapons,

to eliminate the dangers posed by weapons of mass destruction and the resolve to 
strive for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear
