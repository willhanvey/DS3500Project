 The General Assembly, 

 Bearing in mind the role and authority of the General Assembly as a principal 
organ of the United Nations and the importance of its effectiveness and efficiency in 
fulfilling its functions under the Charter of the United Nations, 

 Recognizing that the current interdependent international environment requires 
the strengthening of the multilateral system in accordance with the purposes and 
principles of the United Nations and the principles of international law, 

 Recognizing also the importance of cooperation between the United Nations 
and regional organizations, as well as the benefits to the United Nations of such 
cooperation, 

 Acknowledging that it is for each regional organization to define the modalities 
of its external representation, 

 Recalling its resolution 3208 (XXIX) of 11 October 1974, by which it granted 
observer status to the European Economic Community, 

 Recalling also that, consistent with the relevant legal provisions, the European 
Union has replaced the European Community and is a party to many instruments 
concluded under the auspices of the United Nations and an observer or participant in 
the work of several specialized agencies and United Nations bodies,

of the European Council, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs 
and Security Policy, the European Commission and the European Union delegations,

 3. Recognizes that, following a request on behalf of a regional organization 
that has observer status in the General Assembly and whose member States have
