the right to development and his additional work on and clarifications of the
“development compact” proposal, which contributed to a better understanding of
this proposal, while recognizing that further clarification is still needed;

actors involved in its implementation;

that while development facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights, the lack of
development may not be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally
recognized human rights;

action and international cooperation must reinforce each other in a manner that goes

importance of international cooperation;

legal, political, economic and social environment for the realization of the right to

transparent and accountable governance, as well as the need for efficient national

economic, cultural, political and social rights, without any distinction;
