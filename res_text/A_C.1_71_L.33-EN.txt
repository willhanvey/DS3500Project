  Angola, Argentina, Austria, Burkina Faso, Chile, Ghana, Ireland, Kenya, 

Liechtenstein, Malawi, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Nigeria, Papua New 

Guinea, Peru, Samoa, Sierra Leone, Sweden and Switzerland: draft resolution 
 

 

  Decreasing the operational readiness of nuclear weapons systems 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 62/36 of 5 December 2007, 63/41 of 2 December 

2008, 65/71 of 8 December 2010, 67/46 of 3 December 2012 and 69/42 of 

2 December 2014, 

 Recalling also that the maintenance of nuclear weapons on high alert was a 

feature of cold war nuclear postures, and welcoming the increased confidence and 

transparency since the cessation of the cold war,  

 Concerned that, notwithstanding the end of the cold war, several thousand 

nuclear weapons remain on high alert, ready to be launched within minutes, 

 Noting the continuing engagement in multilateral disarmament forums in 

support of further reductions to the operational status of nuclear weapons systems,  

 Recognizing that the maintenance of nuclear weapons systems at a high level 

of readiness increases the risk of the unintentional or accidental use of such 

weapons, which would have catastrophic humanitarian consequences,  

 Recognizing also that reductions in deployments and the lowering of 

operational status contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security, 

as well as to the process of nuclear disarmament, through the enhancement of 

confidence-building and transparency measures and a diminishing role for nuclear 

weapons in security policies, 

 Welcoming the steps taken by some States in support of nuclear disarmament, 

including de-targeting initiatives, increasing the amount of preparation time 

required for deployment and other measures to diminish further the possibility of 

nuclear launches resulting from accidents, unauthorized actions or misperceptions,

16-17633 2/2 

 

 Recalling the adoption by consensus of the conclusions and recommendations 

for follow-on actions by the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on 

the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,
1
 including the commitments of the 

nuclear-weapon States to promptly engage with a view to, inter alia, considering the 

legitimate interest of non-nuclear-weapon States in further reducing the operational 

status of nuclear weapons systems in ways that promote international stability and 

security, 

 Acknowledging, in this regard, the continued dialogue among the nuclear -

weapon States to advance their nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament 

commitments under the action plan of the 2010 Review Conference
1
 and the 

potential of this process for leading to deeper engagement on nuclear disarmament 

and greater mutual confidence, 

 Taking note of the references to operational readiness in reports of the nuclear -

weapon States during the last review cycle of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 

Nuclear Weapons, 

 Welcoming all opportunities to address the further reduction of the operational 

status of nuclear weapons systems as a step leading to nuclear disarmament,  

 1. Calls for further practical steps to be taken to decrease the operational 

readiness of nuclear weapons systems, with a view to ensuring that all nuclear 

weapons are removed from high alert status;  

 2.  Looks forward to the issue of the lowering of the operational readiness of 

nuclear weapons systems being addressed further at the next review cycle of the 

Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; 

 3. Urges States to update the General Assembly on progress made in the 

implementation of the present resolution;  

 4. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
