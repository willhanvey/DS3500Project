Fifty-fifth session

Agenda item 73
General and complete disarmament

Japan: draft resolution

A path to the total elimination of nuclear weapons

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolutions 49/75 H of 15 December 1994, 50/70 C of 12
December 1995, 51/45 G of 10 December 1996, 52/38 K of 9 December 1997,
53/77 U of 4 December 1998 and 54/54 D of 1 December 1999,

Recognizing that the enhancement of international peace and security and the
promotion of nuclear disarmament mutually complement and strengthen each other,

Reaffirming the crucial importance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as the cornerstone of the international regime for nuclear
non-proliferation and as an essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear
disarmament,

Recalling the progress made by the nuclear-weapon States on reduction of
their nuclear weapons unilaterally or through their negotiations, and the efforts for
nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation by the international community,

Also reaffirming the conviction that further advancement in nuclear
disarmament will contribute to consolidating the international regime for nuclear
non-proliferation, ensuring international peace and security,

Bearing in mind the recent nuclear tests, as well as the regional situations,
which pose a challenge to international efforts to strengthen the global regime of
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons,

Taking note of the report of the Tokyo Forum for Nuclear Non-Proliferation
and Disarmament, bearing in mind the various views of Member States on the
report,

Welcoming the successful adoption of the final document at the 2000 NPT
Review Conference, which includes, inter alia, an unequivocal undertaking by the
nuclear-weapon States to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals

A/C.1/55/L.39

leading to nuclear disarmament to which all States parties are committed under
Article VI of NPT,

1. Reaffirms the importance of achieving the universality of NPT, and calls
upon States not parties to NPT to accede to it as non-nuclear-weapon States without
delay and without conditions;

2. Also reaffirms the importance for all States parties to NPT to fulfil their
obligations under the Treaty;

3. Stresses the central importance of taking the following practical steps for
the systematic and progressive efforts to implement Article VI of the NPT and
paragraphs 3 and 4 (c) of the 1995 Decision on “Principles and Objectives for
Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament”:

(a) The early signature and ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-
Ban Treaty by all States, especially by those States whose ratification is required for
its entry into force, with a view to its early entry into force before 2003, as well as a
moratorium on nuclear-weapon-test explosions or any other nuclear explosions
pending its entry into force;

(b) The immediate commencement of negotiations in the Conference on
Disarmament and their conclusion as early as possible before 2005 of a non-
discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty
banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear
explosive devices, in accordance with the statement of the Special Coordinator in
1995 and the mandate contained therein, taking into consideration both nuclear
disarmament and non-proliferation objectives and, pending its entry into force, a
moratorium on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons;

(c) The establishment of an appropriate subsidiary body with a mandate to
deal with nuclear disarmament in the Conference on Disarmament in the context of
establishing a programme of work;

(d) The inclusion of the principle of irreversibility to apply to nuclear
disarmament, nuclear and other related arms control and reduction measures;

(e) The early entry into force and full implementation of the Treaty on
Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (START II) and the
conclusion of START III as soon as possible, while preserving and strengthening the
ABM Treaty as a cornerstone of strategic stability and as a basis for further
reductions of strategic offensive weapons, in accordance with its provisions;

(f) Steps by all the nuclear-weapon States leading to nuclear disarmament in
a way that promotes international stability, and based on the principle of
undiminished security for all:

(i) Further efforts by all the nuclear-weapon States to continue to reduce
their nuclear arsenals, unilaterally or through their negotiations;

(ii) Increased transparency by the nuclear-weapon States with regard to the
nuclear weapons capabilities and the implementation of agreements pursuant
to Article VI and as voluntary confidence-building measures to support further
progress on nuclear disarmament;

A/C.1/55/L.39

(iii) The further reduction of non-strategic nuclear weapons, based on
unilateral initiatives and as an integral part of the nuclear arms reduction and
disarmament process;

(iv) Concrete agreed measures to further reduce the operational status of
nuclear weapons systems;

(v) A diminishing role for nuclear weapons in security policies to minimize
the risk that these weapons will ever be used and to facilitate the process of
their total elimination;

(vi) The engagement as soon as appropriate of all the nuclear-weapon States
in the process leading to the total elimination of their nuclear weapons;

4. Recognizes also that the realization of a world free of nuclear weapons
will require further steps by the nuclear-weapon States, including:

(a) The continuation of the nuclear disarmament process beyond START III;

(b) Deeper reductions by all the nuclear-weapon States, unilaterally or
through their negotiations, in nuclear weapons in the process of working towards
achieving their elimination;

5. Invites the nuclear-weapon States to keep the States Members of the
United Nations duly informed of the progress or efforts made towards nuclear
disarmament;

6. Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons,
notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile
materials and calls for arrangements by all the nuclear-weapon States to place, as
soon as practicable, fissile material designated by each of them as no longer
required for military purposes under IAEA or other relevant international
verification and arrangements for the disposition of such material for peaceful
purposes to ensure that such material remains permanently outside of military
programmes;

7. Stresses the importance of further development of the verification
capabilities, including IAEA safeguards, that will be required to provide assurance
of compliance with nuclear disarmament agreements for the achievement and
maintenance of a nuclear-weapon-free world;

8. Calls upon all States to redouble their efforts to prevent the proliferation
of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, including their means of delivery,
confirming and strengthening, if necessary, their policies not to transfer equipment,
materials or technology that could contribute to the proliferation of those weapons;

9. Calls for unilateral and cooperative efforts to prevent weapons of mass
destruction, inter alia, nuclear weapons from falling into the hands of non-State
actors;

10. Stresses the importance of the IAEA Model Protocol1 with a view to
enhancing nuclear non-proliferation, and encourages all States which have not done
so to conclude an additional protocol with IAEA as soon as possible;

nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament.
