Elimination of unilateral extraterritorial coercive economic
measures as a means of political and economic compulsion

Libyan Arab Jamahiriya: draft resolution

Elimination of unilateral extraterritorial coercive economic
measures as a means of political and economic compulsion

The General Assembly,

Guided by the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations,
particularly those that call for the development of friendly relations among nations
and the strengthening of cooperation in solving problems of an economic and social
character,

Taking note of the opposition of the international community to unilateral
extraterritorial coercive economic measures,

Recalling its resolutions in which it has called upon the international
community to take urgent and effective steps to end unilateral extraterritorial
coercive economic measures,

Gravely concerned over the continued application of unilateral extraterritorial
coercive measures whose effects have an impact on the sovereignty of other States
and the legitimate interests of their entities and individuals in violation of the norms
of international law and the purposes and principles of the United Nations,

Believing that the prompt elimination of such measures would be consistent
with the purposes and principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and
the relevant provisions of the Agreement on the World Trade Organization,

Recalling its resolutions 51/22 of 27 November 1996, 53/10 of 26 October
1998 and 55/6 of 26 October 2000,

1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation
of resolution 55/6;

* Reissued for technical reasons.



2

A/57/L.4

2. Reaffirms that all peoples have the right to self-determination and that by
virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their
economic, social and cultural development;

3. Express its deep concern at the negative impact of unilaterally imposed
extraterritorial coercive economic measures on trade and financial and economic
cooperation, including at the regional level, because they are contrary to recognized
principles of international law and pose serious obstacles to the freedom of trade and
the free flow of capital at the regional and international levels;

4. Reiterates its call for the repeal of unilateral extraterritorial laws that
impose coercive economic measures contrary to international law on corporations
and nationals of other States;

5. Again calls upon all States not to recognize or apply unilateral
extraterritorial coercive economic measures imposed by any State which are
contrary to recognized principles of international law;

6. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its
fifty-ninth session a report on the implementation of the present resolution;

7. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-ninth session an
item entitled “Elimination of unilateral extraterritorial coercive economic measures
as a means of political and economic compulsion”.
