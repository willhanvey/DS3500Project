 The General Assembly, 

 Guided by the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United 
Nations and the rules of humanitarian international law, 

 Determined to promote multilateralism as an essential means to carry forward 
negotiations on arms regulation and disarmament, 

 Convinced that as humankind is more aware of the need to take immediate 
measures to protect the environment, any event that could jeopardize such efforts 
requires urgent attention to implement the required measures, 

 Taking into consideration the potential harmful effects of the use of armaments 
and ammunitions containing depleted uranium on human health and the 
environment,  

 1. Requests the Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States and 
relevant international organizations on the effects of the use of armaments and 
ammunitions containing depleted uranium, and to submit a report on this subject to 
the General Assembly at its sixty-third session; 

 2. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-third session the 
item entitled “Effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted 
uranium”.
