safer world for all and to achieve the peace and security of a world without nuclear 

weapons,3 

 Noting with satisfaction the renewed attention to the catastrophic humanitarian 

consequences and risks associated with nuclear weapons that has been generated by 

the international community since 2010 and the growing awareness that these 

concerns should underpin the need for nuclear disarmament and the urgency of 

achieving and maintaining a nuclear-weapon-free world, and noting with satisfaction 

also the prominence accorded to the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons in

Documents of the 2000 7  and the 2010 8  Review Conferences of the Parties to the 

Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and in particular the 

unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon States to accomplish the total 

elimination of their nuclear arsenals, leading to nuclear disarmament, in accordance 

with commitments made under article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 

Nuclear Weapons,9  

 Reaffirming the commitment of all States parties to the Treaty on the 

Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to applying the principles of irreversibility, 

verifiability and transparency in relation to the implementation of their treaty 

obligations,  

 Recognizing the continued vital importance of the entry into force of the 

Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty 10  to the advancement of nuclear 

disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation objectives,  

 Recalling that the total elimination of nuclear weapons is the only absolute 

guarantee against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons and the legitimate 

interest of non-nuclear-weapon States in receiving unequivocal and legally binding 

negative security assurances from nuclear-weapon States pending the total 

elimination of nuclear weapons,  

 Reaffirming the conviction that, pending the total elimination of nuclear 

weapons, the establishment and maintenance of nuclear-weapon-free zones enhances 

global and regional peace and security, strengthens the nuclear non-proliferation 

regime and contributes towards realizing the objectives of nuclear disarmament, and 

welcoming the Conferences of States Parties and Signatories to Treaties that Establish 

Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones and Mongolia,  

 Urging States to continue to make real progress towards strengthening all 

existing nuclear-weapon-free zones, inter alia, through the ratification of existing 

treaties and relevant protocols and the withdrawal or revision of any reservations or 

interpretative declarations contrary to the object and purpose of the treaties 

establishing such zones,  

 Recalling the encouragement expressed at the 2010 Review Conference for the 

establishment of further nuclear-weapon-free zones, on the basis of arrangements 

freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned, reaffirming the expectation 

that this will be followed by concerted international efforts to create such zones in 

areas where they do not currently exist, especially in the Middle East, in this context 

noting with deep disappointment the non-fulfilment of the agreement at the 2010 

Review Conference on practical steps to fully implement the 1995 resolution on the 

Middle East,6 and disappointed that no agreement could be reached at the 2015 

Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 

Weapons on this issue,  

 Deeply disappointed at the continued absence of progress towards multilateral 

nuclear disarmament at the Conference on Disarmament, which has been unable for 

the past 22 years to agree upon and implement a programme of work, and

disappointed that the Disarmament Commission has not produced a substantive 

outcome on nuclear disarmament since 1999,  

 Deeply regretting the lack of any substantive outcome of the 2015 Review 

Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,  

 Disappointed that the 2015 Review Conference missed an opportunity to 

strengthen the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, enhance progress 

towards its full implementation and universality and monitor the implementation of 

commitments made and actions agreed upon at the 1995, 2000 and 2010 Review 

Conferences, and deeply concerned about the impact of this failure on the Treaty and 

the balance between its three pillars,  

 Noting with concern the rising tensions in international relations and the 

increased prominence being given by some States to nuclear weapons in their security 

doctrines, including through modernization programmes,  

 Noting the second session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2020 Review 

Conference of the Parties to Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,

 Emphasizing the importance of a constructive and successful preparatory 

process leading to the 2020 Review Conference, and urging all Member States to step 

up their efforts in this regard, and emphasising also that it should contribute to 

strengthening the Treaty and making progress towards achieving its full 

implementation and universality, and monitor the implementation of commitments 

made and actions agreed at the 1995, 2000 and 2010 Review Conferences,  

 Welcoming that the Russian Federation and the United States of America have 

completed the nuclear weapon reductions agreed under the new strategic arms 

reduction treaty, while re-emphasizing the encouragement of the 2010 Review 

Conference to both States to continue discussions on follow-on measures in order to 

achieve deeper reductions in their nuclear arsenals,  

 Underlining the importance of multilateralism in relation to nuclear 

disarmament, while recognizing the value of unilateral, bilateral and regional 

initiatives and the importance of compliance with the terms of these initiatives,  

 1. Reiterates that each article of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 

Nuclear Weapons9 is binding on the States parties at all times and in all circumstances 

and that all States parties should be held fully accountable with respect to strict 

compliance with their obligations under the Treaty, and calls upon all States parties 

to comply fully with all decisions, resolutions and commitments made at the 1995, 

2000 and 2010 Review Conferences;  

 2. Also reiterates the deep concern expressed by the 2010 Review 

Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons

need for all States at all times to comply with applicable international law, including 

international humanitarian law;3  

 3. Acknowledges the evidence presented at the Conferences on the 

Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons, and calls upon Member States, in  their 

relevant decisions and actions, to give due prominence to the humanitarian 

imperatives that underpin nuclear disarmament and to the urgency of achieving this 

goal;  

 4. Recalls the reaffirmation of the continued validity of the practical steps 

agreed to in the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the 



 
A/C.1/73/L.64 

 

5/7 18-17439 

 

Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, 11  including the specific 

reaffirmation of the unequivocal undertaking of the nuclear-weapon States to 

accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear 

disarmament, to which all States parties are committed under article VI of the Treaty, 

recalls the commitment of the nuclear-weapon States to accelerating concrete 

progress on the steps leading to nuclear disarmament, and calls upon the nuclear-

weapon States to take all steps necessary to accelerate the fulfilment of their 

commitments;  

 5. Calls upon the nuclear-weapon States to fulfil their commitment to 

undertaking further efforts to reduce and ultimately eliminate all types of nuclear 

weapons, deployed and non-deployed, including through unilateral, bilateral, regional 

and multilateral measures;  

 6. Urges all States possessing nuclear weapons to decrease the operational 

readiness of nuclear-weapon systems in a verifiable and transparent manner with a 

view to ensuring that all nuclear weapons are removed from high alert status;  

 7. Encourages the nuclear-weapon States to make concrete reductions in the 

role and significance of nuclear weapons in all military and security concepts,

Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of the legitimate interest of non-nuclear-weapon 

States in the constraining by the nuclear-weapon States of the development and 

qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons and their ending the development of 

advanced new types of nuclear weapons, and calls upon the nuclear-weapon States to 

take steps in this regard;  

 10. Notes with concern recent policy statements by nuclear-weapon States 

relating to the modernization of their nuclear weapon programmes, which undermine 

their commitments to nuclear disarmament and increase the risk of the use of nuclear 

weapons and the potential for a new arms race;  

 11. Encourages further steps by all nuclear-weapon States, in accordance with 

the previous obligations and commitments on nuclear disarmament, to ensure the 

irreversible removal of all fissile material designated by each nuclear-weapon State 

as no longer required for military purposes, and calls upon all States to support, within 

the context of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the development of 

appropriate nuclear disarmament verification capabilities and legally binding 

verification arrangements, thereby ensuring that such material remains permanently 

outside military programmes in a verifiable manner;  

 12. Calls upon all States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 

Nuclear Weapons to work towards the full implementation of the resolution on the 

Middle East adopted at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to 

the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,6 which is inextricably linked 

to the indefinite extension of the Treaty, and expresses disappointment and deep 

concern at the lack of a substantive outcome of the 2015 Review Conference of the 

Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, including on the 

process to establish a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons
