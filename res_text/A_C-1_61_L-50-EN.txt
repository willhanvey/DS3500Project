  Role of science and technology in the context of international 
security and disarmament 
 
 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recognizing that scientific and technological developments can have both 
civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for 
civilian applications needs to be maintained and encouraged, 

 Concerned that military applications of scientific and technological 
developments can contribute significantly to the improvement and upgrading of 
advanced weapons systems and, in particular, weapons of mass destruction, 

 Aware of the need to follow closely the scientific and technological 
developments that may have a negative impact on international security and 
disarmament, and to channel scientific and technological developments for 
beneficial purposes, 

 Cognizant that international transfers of dual-use as well as high-technology 
products, services and know-how for peaceful purposes are important for the 
economic and social development of States, 

 Also cognizant of the need to regulate such transfers of dual-use goods and 
technologies and high technology with military applications through multilaterally 
negotiated, universally applicable, non-discriminatory guidelines, 

 Expressing its concern about growing proliferation of ad hoc and exclusive 
export control regimes and arrangements for dual-use goods and technologies, 
which tend to impede the economic and social development of developing countries, 



A/C.1/61/L.50  
 

06-56760 2 
 

 Recalling that in the final document of the Fourteenth Summit Conference of 
Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in Havana from 
11 to 16 September 2006,1 it was again noted with concern that undue restrictions 
on exports to developing countries of material, equipment and technology for 
peaceful purposes persisted,  

 Emphasizing that internationally negotiated guidelines for the transfer of high 
technology with military applications should take into account the legitimate 
defence requirements of all States and the requirements for the maintenance of 
international peace and security, while ensuring that access to high-technology 
products and services and know-how for peaceful purposes is not denied, 

 1. Affirms that scientific and technological progress should be used for the 
benefit of all mankind to promote the sustainable economic and social development 
of all States and to safeguard international security, and that international 
cooperation in the use of science and technology through the transfer and exchange 
of technological know-how for peaceful purposes should be promoted; 

 2. Invites Member States to undertake additional efforts to apply science 
and technology for disarmament-related purposes and to make disarmament-related 
technologies available to interested States; 

 3. Urges Member States to undertake multilateral negotiations with the 
participation of all interested States in order to establish universally acceptable, 
non-discriminatory guidelines for international transfers of dual-use goods and 
technologies and high technology with military applications; 

 4. Encourages United Nations bodies to contribute, within existing 
mandates, to promoting the application of science and technology for peaceful 
purposes; 

 5. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-third session the 
item entitled “Role of science and technology in the context of international security 
and disarmament”.
