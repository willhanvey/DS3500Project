development,

Taking note of the outcome of the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World

Recalling that the Declaration on the Right to Development, adopted by the
General Assembly in its resolution 41/128 of 4 December 1986, confirmed that the

for development is a prerogative both of nations and of individuals who make up
nations, and the individual as the central subject and beneficiary of development,

Stressing that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action3 reaffirmed
the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of
all human rights, and the individual as the central subject and beneficiary of
development,

Recalling all its previous resolutions and those of the Commission on Human
Rights on the right to development, in particular Commission resolution 1998/72 of
22 April 1998, on the urgent need to make further progress towards the realization
of the right to development as set out in the Declaration on the Right to
Development,

Reiterating continued support for the New Partnership for Africa’s
Development7 as a development framework for Africa,

Stressing that poverty eradication is one of the critical elements in the

multifaceted problem that requires a multifaceted approach in addressing economic,
political, social, environmental and institutional dimensions at all levels, especially
in the context of the United Nations Millennium Development Goal of halving, by
the year 2015, the proportion of the world’s people whose income is less than one
dollar a day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger,

Expressing regret that the Working Group on the Right to Development, at its
fourth session, did not reach a conclusion, in particular on the implementation of the
agreed conclusions of the third session of the Working Group, while aware of the
views and observations of the Chairperson-Rapporteur,

1. Endorses the agreed conclusions of the third session of the Working
Group on the Right to Development,8 as adopted by the Commission on Human
Rights in its resolution 2002/69 of 25 April 2002,9 which constitute a solid
foundation for further initiatives towards the promotion and the realization of the
right to development;

2. Regrets that the fourth session of the Working Group did not reach a
conclusion, and encourages it, at its fifth session, to work more effectively in

3. Stresses the importance of the core principles that underpin the purpose
of international human rights instruments, such as equality, equity, non-
discrimination, transparency, accountability, participation and international
cooperation, as critical to mainstreaming the right to development at the
international level;

4. Reaffirms the commitments to implement the goals and targets set in all
the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits and their review
processes, in particular those relating to the realization of the right to development,
recognizing that its realization is critical to achieving the objectives, goals and
targets set in those outcome documents;

5. Reaffirms also that the realization of the right to development is essential
to the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action,3 which
regards all human rights as universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated,
places the human person at the centre of development and recognizes that, while
development facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights, the lack of development
may not be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally recognized human
rights;

6. Stresses that the basic responsibility for the promotion and protection of
all human rights lies with the State, and reaffirms that States have the primary
responsibility for their own economic and social development and that the role of
national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized;

7. Reaffirms that States have the primary responsibility for the creation of
national and international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to
development and their commitment to cooperating with each other to that end;

8. Reaffirms also the need for an international environment that is
conducive to the realization of the right to development;

9. Stresses the need to strive for the greater acceptance, operationalization
and realization of the right to development at the international level, and calls on
States to undertake the necessary policy formulation and to institute the measures
required for the implementation of the right to development as a fundamental human
right;

10. Emphasizes the critical importance of identifying and analysing obstacles
impeding the full realization of the right to development at both the national and
international levels;

11. Affirms that, while globalization offers both opportunities and challenges,
the process of globalization remains deficient in achieving the objectives of
integrating all countries into a globalized world, and stresses the need for policies
and measures at the national and global levels to respond to the challenges and
opportunities of globalization if this process is to be made fully inclusive and
equitable;

12. Recognizes that, despite continuous efforts on the part of the international
community, the gap between developed and developing countries remains
unacceptably wide, that developing countries continue to face difficulties in
participating in the globalization process and that many risk being marginalized and
effectively excluded from its benefits;

13. Reaffirms the commitment, and urges developed countries that have not
yet done so, to make concrete efforts towards meeting the targets of 0.7 per cent of
their gross national product for official development assistance to developing
countries and 0.15 to 0.2 per cent of their gross national product to least developed
countries, and encourages developing countries to build on the progress achieved in
ensuring that official development assistance is used effectively to help meet
development goals and targets;

14. Recognizes that historical injustices have undeniably contributed to the
poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion, economic disparities,
instability and insecurity that affect many people in different parts of the world, in
particular in developing countries;

15. Recognizes also the need to address market access for developing
countries, including in respect of agriculture, services and non-agricultural products,
in particular those of interest to developing countries;

16. Considers that a desirable pace of meaningful trade liberalization, in
particular in relation to agricultural trade and other areas under negotiation;
implementation of commitments on implementation-related issues and concerns;
review of special and differential-treatment provisions, with a view to strengthening
them and making them more precise, effective and operational; avoidance of new
forms of protectionism; and capacity-building and technical assistance for
developing countries are important issues in making progress towards the effective
implementation of the right to development;

17. Underlines the fact that the international community is far from meeting
the target set in the Millennium Declaration1 of halving the number of people living
in poverty by 2015, and emphasizes the principle of international cooperation,
including partnership and commitment, between developed and developing countries
towards achieving the goal;

18. Recognizes the important link between the international economic,
commercial and financial spheres and the realization of the right to development,
stresses, in this regard,  the need to broaden the base of decision-making at the
international level on issues of development concern and to fill organizational gaps,
as well as strengthen the United Nations system and other multilateral institutions,
and also stresses the need to broaden and strengthen the participation of developing
countries and economies in transition in international economic decision-making
and norm-setting;

19. Recognizes also that good governance and the rule of law at the national
level assist all States in the promotion and protection of human rights, including the
right to development, and agrees on the value of the ongoing efforts being made by
States to identify and strengthen good governance practices, including transparent,
responsible, accountable and participatory government, that are responsive and
appropriate to their needs and aspirations, including in the context of agreed
partnership approaches to development, capacity-building and technical assistance;

20. Recognizes further the important role and the rights of women and the
application of a gender perspective as a cross-cutting issue in the process of
realizing the right to development, and notes in particular the positive relationship
between women’s education and their equal participation in the civil, cultural,

A/C.3/58/L.52

economic, political and social activities of the community and the promotion of the
right to development;

21. Stresses the need for the integration of the rights of children, girls and
boys alike, in all policies and programmes, and for ensuring the protection and
promotion of those rights, especially in areas relating to health, education and the
full development of their capacities;

22. Stresses also that further measures must be taken at the national and
international levels to fight HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases, taking into
account ongoing efforts and programmes, and reiterates the need for international
assistance in this regard;

23. Recognizes the need for strong partnerships with civil society
organizations and the private sector in pursuit of poverty eradication and
development, as well as for good corporate governance;

24. Emphasizes the urgent need for taking concrete measures, including the
repatriation of illegally acquired assets and funds to the countries of origin, to fight
against all forms of corruption at the national and international levels, and stresses
the importance of a genuine political commitment on the part of all Governments
through a firm legal framework, and in this context urges States to sign and ratify
the Convention against Corruption4 as soon as possible;

25. Looks forward to the consideration by the Commission on Human Rights
at its sixty-first session of the concept document to be prepared by the
Subcommission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights establishing
options for the implementation of the right to development and their feasibility, inter
alia, an international legal standard of a binding nature, guidelines on the
implementation of the right to development and principles for development
partnership, based on the Declaration on the Right to Development, as well as issues
that any such instrument might address, and the determination by the Commission of
the feasibility of those options;

26. Emphasizes the need to further strengthen the activities of the Office of
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the promotion and
realization of the right to development, including ensuring effective use of the
financial and human resources necessary to fulfil its mandate, and better servicing of
and support for the Working Group on the Right to Development;

27. Requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the Office of the High
Commissioner effectively assists in implementing the recommendations contained in
the agreed conclusions of the third session of the Working Group on the Right to
