Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland and United States of America: 
draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions concerning the situation in Somalia, 
especially resolutions 1814 (2008), 1816 (2008), 1838 (2008), 1844 (2008), 
1846 (2008), and 1851 (2008),  

 Continuing to be gravely concerned by the ongoing threat that piracy and 
armed robbery at sea against vessels pose to the prompt, safe, and effective delivery 
of humanitarian aid to Somalia and the region, to international navigation and the 
safety of commercial maritime routes, and to other vulnerable ships, including 
fishing activities in conformity with international law and the extended range of the 
piracy threat into the western Indian Ocean,  

 Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political 
independence and unity of Somalia, including Somalia’s rights with respect to 
offshore natural resources, including fisheries, in accordance with international law, 

 Further reaffirming that international law, as reflected in the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (“The Convention”), sets 
out the legal framework applicable to combating piracy and armed robbery at sea, as 
well as other ocean activities,  

 Again taking into account the crisis situation in Somalia, and the limited 
capacity of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) to interdict, or upon 
interdiction to prosecute pirates or to patrol or secure the waters off the coast of 
Somalia, including the international sea lanes and Somalia’s territorial waters,  

 Noting the several requests from the TFG for international assistance to 
counter piracy off its coast, including the letters of 2 and 6 November 2009 from the 
Permanent Representative of Somalia to the United Nations expressing the 
appreciation of the TFG to the Security Council for its assistance, expressing the 
TFG’s willingness to consider working with other States and regional organizations 
to combat piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, and requesting 



S/2009/607  
 

09-62479 2 
 

that the provisions of resolutions 1846 (2008) and 1851 (2008) be renewed for an 
additional twelve months,  

 Commending the efforts of the EU operation Atalanta, which the European 
Union is committed to extending until December 2010, North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization operations Allied Protector and Ocean Shield, Combined Maritime 
Forces’ Combined Task Force 151, and other States acting in a national capacity in 
cooperation with the TFG and each other, to suppress piracy and to protect 
vulnerable ships transiting through the waters off the coast of Somalia,  

 Noting with concern that the continuing limited capacity and domestic 
legislation to facilitate the custody and prosecution of suspected pirates after their 
capture has hindered more robust international action against the pirates off the 
coast of Somalia, and in some cases has led to pirates being released without facing 
justice, regardless of whether there is sufficient evidence to support prosecution, 
reiterating that, consistent with the provisions of the Convention concerning the 
repression of piracy, the 1988 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts 
Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (“SUA Convention”) provides for parties 
to create criminal offences, establish jurisdiction, and accept delivery of persons 
responsible for or suspected of seizing or exercising control over a ship by force or 
threat thereof or any other form of intimidation, and stressing the need for States to 
criminalize piracy under their domestic law and to favourably consider the 
prosecution, in appropriate cases, of suspected pirates, consistent with applicable 
international law, 

 Commending the Republic of Kenya’s efforts to prosecute suspected pirates in 
its national courts, and noting with appreciation the assistance being provided by the 
United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and other international 
organizations and donors, in coordination with the Contact Group on Piracy off the 
Coast of Somalia (“CGPCS”), to support Kenya, Somalia and other States in the 
region, including Seychelles and Yemen, to take steps to prosecute or incarcerate in 
a third state after prosecution elsewhere captured pirates consistent with applicable 
international human rights law,  

 Noting the ongoing efforts within the CGPCS to explore possible additional 
mechanisms to effectively prosecute persons suspected of piracy and armed robbery 
at sea off the coast of Somalia,  

 Further noting with appreciation the ongoing efforts by UNODC and UNDP to 
support efforts to enhance the capacity of the corrections system in Somalia, 
including regional authorities, to incarcerate convicted pirates consistent with 
applicable international human rights law,  

 Welcoming the adoption of the Djibouti Code of Conduct concerning the 
Repression of Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in the Western Indian Ocean 
and the Gulf of Aden, and the establishment of the International Maritime 
Organization (IMO) Djibouti Code Trust Fund (Multi-donor trust fund- Japan 
initiated), as well as the International Trust Fund Supporting Initiatives of the 
CGPCS, and recognizing the efforts of signatory States to develop the appropriate 
regulatory and legislative frameworks to combat piracy, enhance their capacity to 
patrol the waters of the region, interdict suspect vessels, and prosecute suspected 
pirates, 



 S/2009/607
 

3 09-62479 
 

 Emphasizing that peace and stability within Somalia, the strengthening of State 
institutions, economic and social development and respect for human rights and the 
rule of law are necessary to create the conditions for a durable eradication of piracy 
and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, and further emphasizing that 
Somalia’s long-term security rests with the effective development by the TFG of the 
National Security Force and Somali Police Force, in the framework of the Djibouti 
Agreement and in line with a national security strategy, 

 Determining that the incidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast 
of Somalia exacerbate the situation in Somalia, which continues to constitute a 
threat to international peace and security in the region,  

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 1. Reiterates that it condemns and deplores all acts of piracy and armed 
robbery against vessels in the waters off the coast of Somalia;  

 2. Notes again its concern regarding the findings contained in the 
20 November 2008 report of the Monitoring Group on Somalia (S/2008/769, page 55) 
that escalating ransom payments and the lack of enforcement of the arms embargo 
established by resolution 733 (1992) are fuelling the growth of piracy off the coast 
of Somalia, and calls upon all States to fully cooperate with the Monitoring Group 
on Somalia; 

 3. Renews its call upon States and regional organizations that have the 
capacity to do so, to take part in the fight against piracy and armed robbery at sea 
off the coast of Somalia, in particular, consistent with this resolution and 
international law, by deploying naval vessels, arms and military aircraft and through 
seizures and disposition of boats, vessels, arms and other related equipment used in 
the commission of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, or for 
which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting such use;  

 4. Commends the work of the CGPCS to facilitate coordination in order to 
deter acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, in 
cooperation with the IMO, flag States, and the TFG and urges States and 
international organizations to continue to support these efforts; 

 5. Acknowledges Somalia’s rights with respect to offshore natural resources, 
including fisheries, in accordance with international law, and calls upon States and 
interested organizations, including the IMO, to provide technical assistance to 
Somalia, including regional authorities, and nearby coastal States upon their request 
to enhance their capacity to ensure coastal and maritime security, including 
combating piracy and armed robbery at sea off the Somali and nearby coastlines, 
and stresses the importance of coordination in this regard through the CGPCS; 

 6. Invites all States and regional organizations fighting piracy off the coast 
of Somalia to conclude special agreements or arrangements with countries willing to 
take custody of pirates in order to embark law enforcement officials (“shipriders”) 
from the latter countries, in particular countries in the region, to facilitate the 
investigation and prosecution of persons detained as a result of operations 
conducted under this resolution for acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the 
coast of Somalia, provided that the advance consent of the TFG is obtained for the 
exercise of third state jurisdiction by shipriders in Somali territorial waters and that 



S/2009/607  
 

09-62479 4 
 

such agreements or arrangements do not prejudice the effective implementation of 
the SUA Convention;  

 7. Encourages Member States to continue to cooperate with the TFG in the 
fight against piracy and armed robbery at sea, notes the primary role of the TFG in 
the fight against piracy and armed robbery at sea, and decides that for a period of 
twelve months from the date of this resolution to renew the authorizations as set out 
in paragraph 10 of resolution 1846 (2008) and paragraph 6 of resolution 1851 
(2008) granted to States and regional organizations cooperating with the TFG in the 
fight against piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, for which 
advance notification has been provided by the TFG to the Secretary-General; 

 8. Affirms that the authorizations renewed in this resolution apply only with 
respect to the situation in Somalia and shall not affect the rights or obligations or 
responsibilities of Member States under international law, including any rights or 
obligations under the Convention, with respect to any other situation, and 
underscores in particular that this resolution shall not be considered as establishing 
customary international law; and affirms further that such authorizations have been 
renewed only following the receipt of the 2 and 6 November 2009 letters conveying 
the consent of the TFG;  

 9. Affirms that the measures imposed by paragraph 5 of resolution 
733 (1992) and further elaborated upon by paragraphs 1 and 2 of resolution 
1425 (2002) do not apply to weapons and military equipment destined for the sole 
use of Member States and regional organizations undertaking measures in 
accordance with paragraph 7 above or to supplies of technical assistance to Somalia 
solely for the purposes set out in paragraphs 5 above which have been exempted 
from those measures in accordance with the procedure set out in paragraphs 11 (b) 
and 12 of resolution 1772 (2007);  

 10. Requests that cooperating States take appropriate steps to ensure that the 
activities they undertake pursuant to the authorizations in paragraph 7 do not have 
the practical effect of denying or impairing the right of innocent passage to the ships 
of any third State;  

 11. Calls on Member States to assist Somalia, at the request of the TFG and 
with notification to the Secretary-General, to strengthen capacity in Somalia, 
including regional authorities, to bring to justice those who are using Somali 
territory to plan, facilitate, or undertake criminal acts of piracy and armed robbery at 
sea, and stresses that any measures undertaken pursuant to this paragraph shall be 
consistent with applicable international human rights law;  

 12. Calls upon all States, and in particular flag, port, and coastal States, 
States of the nationality of victims and perpetrators of piracy and armed robbery, 
and other States with relevant jurisdiction under international law and national 
legislation, to cooperate in determining jurisdiction, and in the investigation and 
prosecution of persons responsible for acts of piracy and armed robbery off the 
coast of Somalia, consistent with applicable international law including 
international human rights law, to ensure that all pirates handed over to judicial 
authorities are subject to a judicial process, and to render assistance by, among other 
actions, providing disposition and logistics assistance with respect to persons under 
their jurisdiction and control, such as victims and witnesses and persons detained as 
a result of operations conducted under this resolution;  



 S/2009/607
 

5 09-62479 
 

 13. Commends in this context the decision by the CGPCS to establish an 
International Trust Fund to support its initiatives and encourages donors to 
contribute to it;  

 14. Urges States parties to the Convention and the SUA Convention to fully 
implement their relevant obligations under these Conventions and customary 
international law and cooperate with the UNODC, IMO, and other States and other 
international organizations to build judicial capacity for the successful prosecution 
of persons suspected of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia;  

 15. Welcomes the revisions by the IMO to its recommendations and guidance 
on preventing and suppressing piracy and armed robbery against ships, and urges 
States, in collaboration with the shipping and insurance industries, and the IMO, to 
continue to develop and implement avoidance, evasion, and defensive best practices 
and advisories to take when under attack or when sailing in the waters off the coast 
of Somalia, and further urges States to make their citizens and vessels available for 
forensic investigation as appropriate at the first port of call immediately following 
an act or attempted act of piracy or armed robbery at sea or release from captivity;  

 16. Requests States and regional organizations cooperating with the TFG to 
inform the Security Council and the Secretary-General within nine months of the 
progress of actions undertaken in the exercise of the authorizations provided in 
paragraph 7 above and further requests all States contributing through the CGPCS to 
the fight against piracy off the coast of Somalia, including Somalia and other States 
in the region, to report by the same deadline on their efforts to establish jurisdiction 
and cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of piracy; 

 17. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Security Council within 
11 months of the adoption of this resolution on the implementation of this resolution 
and on the situation with respect to piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of 
Somalia;  

 18. Requests the Secretary-General of the IMO to brief the Security Council 
on the basis of cases brought to his attention by the agreement of all affected coastal 
States, and duly taking into account the existing bilateral and regional cooperative 
arrangements, on the situation with respect to piracy and armed robbery;  

 19. Expresses its intention to review the situation and consider, as 
appropriate, renewing the authorizations provided in paragraph 7 above for 
additional periods upon the request of the TFG;  

 20. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
