11The General Assembly, 

17 Recalling its resolution 31/159 of 20 December 1976, in paragraph 18 
of vrhich it decided to 1 include Arabic among the official and working 
languages of the machinery of UNCTAD? particularly all Sessions of the 
Conference, the Trade and Development Board and its main committees'~ 

11 Noting that the rules of procedure of the United Nations Conference 
on Trade and Development, the Trade and Development Board and some of its 
main committees have been already amended accordingly, 

11Recalling that, in its resolution 31/208 (VIII) of 22 December 1976, 
it approved the organizational arrangements proposed by the Secretary-
General in his report contained in document A/C. 5/31/60 and Corr.l w·ith a 
view to providing an initial target level of Arabic language services to 
UNCTAD while simultaneously alleviating some of the chronic problems facing 
the provision of such services to the General Assembly and its Hain 
Committees, 

"Noting, however, that, as far as .Arabic translation services are 
concerned, the Secretary~General·s progress report contained in document 
A/C.5/32/9 makes it clear that these organizational arrangements have failed 
to achieve their purported objectives both with regard to UNCTAD and to the 
General Assembly and its Hain Committees, while admitting the uncertain 
nature of their future prospects,

system, and to report with recommendations to the General Assembly at its 
thirty-third session. The General Assembly further decides to include an 
item on language services on the agenda for the thirty-third session. 11 

73. After a short discussion of the draft decision, the representative of the 
United States agreed to withdraw it on the understanding that the report of the 
Joint Inspection Unit on implications of additional languages in the United 
Nations system (A/32/237}, as well as the related report of the Secretary-General, 
would take into account the discussion which had taken place on the draft 
proposal in the Fifth Committee.

of an information services unit in the Department of Economic and Social Affairs; 

(b) Decide that the acceptance by the Secretary-General of the offer of

192. Comments made in the course of the discussion of this question in the 
Committee are reflected in the summary record of the meeting (A/C.5/32/SR.68).

DECISION OF THE COMMITTEE 

201. At its 64th meeting, on 15 December, the Fifth Committee decided to take 
note of the reclassifications from P-4 to P-5 and from P-5 to D-1 (A/C.5/32/83).

202. At the 67th meeting, on 19 December, in the course of the first reading of 
section 22 (Administration, management and general services), the Committee acted

203. In paragraph 22.55 of chapter II of its first report on the proposed programme 
budget for the biennium 1978-1979, 22/ the Advisory Committee on Administrative 
and Budgetary Questions, referring to the Secretary-General's proposed arrangements

paragraphs 22.123-22.137 of the proposed programme budget for the 1978-1979 
biennium, stated that: 

"The Advisory Committee is of the op~n~on that the maintenance of an 
adequate and capable management improvement service, as intended by resolution 
31/94 C, would require an arrangement somewhat different from that now 
proposed by the Secretary-General. In particular, the Committee is concerned 
that the important concept of a small corps of qualified experts, dealing 
with management problems, whose independence and effectiveness is assured 
through a line of direct responsibility of the Under-Secretary-General for 
Administration and ~1anagement might become more difficult to sustain within 
the larger context of the proposed new Service." 23/ 

204. Based on a proposal made by the representative of Japan at the 61st meeting 
as a result of consultations with interested delegations, the Fifth Committee 
took the decision below without objection. 

DECISION OF THE COMHITTEE 

205. The Fifth Committee decided to recommend that the General Assembly should: 

(a) Take note of the observations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative 
and Budgetary Questions in paragraph 22.55 of its report on the proposed programme

Fifth Committee on this question, which the Secretary-General is invited to take 
into account, and decide in the rr.eantime, to maintain the present organizational 
arrangements ; 

(b) Decide to return to and consider the questions raised by the Advisory 
Committee and by delegations at its thirty-third session in the context of the 
review of the "question of administrative and management control of the United 
Nations", which will be on the agenda pursuant to General Assembly resolution 
31/94 C. It is the Assembly's understanding that all options will be open to it 
when it considers this matter at that time (see para. 256 below, draft 
resolution X, sect. X). 

206. In his revised estimates for ~ection 22 L.l (International Civil Service 
r.ommission) (A/C.5/32/28), the Secretary-General proposed that the honorarium of 
the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Commission be increased by $9,000 to an 
amount of $54,000 per annum as from l January 1978 and requested an additional 
amount of $36,000 for the biennium 1978-1979 for that purpose. In its related 
report (A/32/8/Add.ll), the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary 
Questions agreed to the Secretary-General's proposal, with certain observations 
reflected in paragraphs 7 and 8 of its report. 

207. At the 67th meeting, the representative of the United States of America 
introduced the following draft decision (A/C.5/32/L.46): 

"Compensation for certain officers serving the General Assembly" 

"The General Assembly, 

"Decides to reconsider at its thirty-third regular session the proposals 
of the Secretary-General with regard to compensation for the two full-term 
Commissioners of the International Civil Service Commission contained in 
document A/C.5/32/28 and the relevant comments of the Advisory Committee in 
document A/32/8/Add.ll, 

"Requests the Secretary-General, with such impartial advice as he deems 
desirable, to prepare a study on the conditions of service and compensation 
appropriate for those officers serving the General Assembly, other than 
Secretariat officials, whose teTms and conditions of selection, duties and 
responsibilities preclude active en~aV-ement by governmental, intergovernmental 
or other specified entities." 

In so doing, he called attention to the first paragraph of the draft decision and 
informed the Committee that the words 11¥rithout prejudice to the possibility of

recommendation of the Advisory Committee in paragraph 22.16 of its first report 
on the proposed budget estimates for the 1978-1979 biennium.

"The General Assembly, 

"Deeply concerned at the persistence of inflation and monetary instability 
in the developed countries in which the United Nations incurs expenditure, 

"Considering the responsibility borne by the developed countries in which 
the United Nations has headquarters for the generation of their own internal 
inflation and for readjustments and fluctuations in the exchange rates of 
their currencies, 

"Considering further the economic advantages which those developed 
countries derive from the presence of the headquarters of United Nations 
bodies in their territory, 

"Recognizing that countries which are not responsible for inflation in, 
and readjustments and fluctuations in the exchange rates of, developed 
countries in which United Nations bodies have headquarters should not defray 
the cost of the losses occasioned thereby, 

"Taking into account the fact that the losses sustained by the United 
Nations as a result of internal inflation in, and readjustments and 
fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies of, developing countries 
in which it has headquarters are relatively small, 

"Taking into account also that the provisions of this resolution shall 
not apply to those developed countries in •mich the United Nations has 
headquarters and which make voluntary contributions for this purpose, meeting 
the requirements mentioned in operative paragraph 3 of this resolution, 

"Mindful of the provisions of Article 17 of the Charter of the United 
Nations, 

"Believing that, in order to cover the substantial losses caused by 
inflation and monetary instability, a different procedure is required from 
that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations, 

"l. Decides that the losses sustained by the United Nations as a result 
of inflation and monetary instability in the developed countries in which it 
has headquarters shall be covered in the following way: 

"(a) Eighty per cent of such losses shall be borne by the developed 
countries in which the United Nations has headquarters, in proportion to the 
expenditures incurred in those countries; 

"(b) The remaining 20 per cent shall be borne by the other countries, 
pro-rated in shares determined by the scale of assessments approved by the 
General Assembly for the corresponding period; 

'~2. Decides also that the losses sustained by the United Nations as a 
result of internal inflation in, and readjustments and fluctuations in the 
exchange rates of the currencies of, the developing countries in which it has 
headquarters shall be absorbed by the regular budget of the United Nations;

"3. Decides further that the provisions of this resolution shall not 
apply to developed countries in which the United Nations has headquarters and 
which make voluntary contributions in order to offset the losses sustained by 
the United Nations as a result of inflation and monetary instability, provided 
that those contributions are in an amount at least equivalent to the amount 
which would be payable by them as a result of their own internal inflation and 
readjustments and fluctuations in the exchange rates of their currencies." 

222. After some procedural discussion, the representative of the Federal Republic of 
Germany proposed that consideration of the draft resolution be deferred to the 
thirty-third session.

1770th meeting requesting the Secretary-General to base his assumptions on the 
actual rate of inflation on the latest available forecast and for currency 
alignments on the actual rate prevailing at the time the documents are 
prepared, 

11 Noting that the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1978-1979 
includes an appropriation for inflation, and exchange rate variation based on 
assumptions whose accuracy will only be tested as the biennium progresses, 

aDesiring to ensure that appropriate control is exercised over the 
expenditure of appropriations allocated to programmes especially that portion 
provided for inflati(n, and exchange rate variation, 

111. Decides that in issuing allotments to programme managers the 
Secretary-General should during the biennium 1978-1979 and subsequent biennia 
satisfy himself that movements in inflation and currency exchange rates are in 
accordance with budget projections, and if the actual rates are favourable by 
comparison reduce the allocations accordingly; 

"2. Further decides that if additional allocations are requested by 
programme managers because of higher rates of inflation or unfavourable 
movements in currency rates, the Secretary-General should ascertain whether 
savings are possible from other sources and reduce the allocations ac~ordingly;

11 3. Requests that if proposals for additional appropriations are made i:e 
the General Assembly to cover higher rates of inflation or less favourable 
exchange rates, than those budgeted for at various duty stations, detailed 
information should be provided on: 

"(a) Savings resulting from lower inflation rates or favourable currency 
variations at other duty stations; 

"(b) Attempts to cover these additional costs by means of savings from 
other sources, for example, economies achieved in executing programmes, or the 
completion of programmes earlier than anticipated.,;

The General Assembly, 

Recalling its decision of 18 December 1974, 26/ adopted at its twenty-ninth 
session, in which it outlined principles and guidelines for the use of experts 
and consultants in the United Nations, and its decision of 17 December 1975, 27/

DRAFT RESOLUTION III 

Arabic language services in the United Nations 

The General Assembly, 

Recalling its resolution 31/159 of 21 December 1976, in paragraph 18 of which 
it decided to include Arabic among the official and working languages of the 
machinery of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, particularly 
all sessions of the Conference, the Trade and Development Board and its main

Recalling that, in section VIII of its resolution 31/208 of 22 December 1976, 
it approved the organizational arrangements proposed by the Secretary-General in 
his report to the General Assembly at its thirty-first session 33/ with a view to 
providing an initial target level of Arabic language services to the United Nations 
Conference on Trade and Development while simultaneously alleviating some of the 
chronic problems facing the provision of such services to the Assembly and its 
Hain Committees, 

Noting, however, that, as far as Arabic translation services are concerned, 
the progress report of the Secretary-General 34/ makes it clear that those 
organizational arrangements have not sufficiently achieved their purported 
objectives with regard to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 
and to the General Assembly and its Main Committees, while admitting the uncertain 
nature of their future prospects, 

Recognizing the great importance which the Arab States Members of the United 
Nations attach to the work of the United nations Conference on Trade and 
Development as 1-rell as their expressed need for having its documentation issued 
in Arabic in time to enable their delegations to participate constructively in its 
deliberations and activities, 

Convinced that an efficient, timely and less costly provision of Arabic 
translation services to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 
can be achieved only by the installation of an adequately staffed service at its 
headquarters, 

Bearing in mind the magnitude and urgency of the efforts needed to enable 
such a service to meet adequately the Arabic translation requirements of the fifth 
session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, to be held in 
1979, 

1. Takes note of the progress report of the Secretary-General concerning 
Arabic language services in the United Nations; 

2. Requests the Secretary-General, while continuing the speedy 
implementation of the organizational arrangements contained in paragraphs 15 to 21 
of his report, 33/ to replace the present arrangement set out in paragraph 25 of 
his report by establishing, as from 1 January 1978, on a permanent basis, an Arabic 
Translation Section in the United Nations Office at Geneva primarily to serve the 
bodies of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and, as an initial 
step, to provide the staff requirements for the biennium 1978-1979 for this 
Section by transferring to it the posts already established under section VIII of 
General Assembly resolution 31/208, with the addition of a post of Chief of 
Section;

resolution 86 (IV) of 28 May 1976~ endorsed by the General Assembly in paragraph 18 
of its resolution 31/159 of 21 December 1976, and to submit those proposals to the 
Assembly at its thirty-fourth session; 

4. Further requests the Secretary-General to continue his search for and to 
applv adequate methods, including advance translation of appropriate documentation 
and provision of temporary assistance when necessary, to ensure the timely 
provision of Arabic translation services to the General Assembly and its Main 
Committees, and to report on the results to the Assembly as appropriate.
