PROPOSED PROGRAMME BUDGET FOR THE BI~lNIUM 1976-1977 
AND MEDIUM-TERM PLAN FOR TH" P:RRIOD. 1976:.1979 

Report of the Fifth Committee 

Rapporteur: llr. Ahmed ABOUL GHEIT (Egypt) 

l. Under agenda item 96, the Fifth Committee considered the proposed programme 
budget for the biennium 1976-1977. The Committee recommends a gross appropriation 
of $745,813,800 and an estimate for income (other than income derived from staff 
assessment) of $16,740,300. The net expenditure for the biennium 1976-1977 is thus 
estimated at $729,073,500. 

2. As regards the 1-Jorking Capital Fund, the Committee recommends that the Fund 
should be maintained for the biennium 1976-1977 at the level of $40 million. 

3. The Committee also recommends an estimate of $101,552,000 as staff assessment 
for transfer in the course of the biennium 1976-1977 to the Tax Equalization Fund 
from which credits are distributed to Member States in accordance with General 
Assembly resolution 973 (X) of 15 December 1955 . 

. 4. For its examination of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1976-
1977, the Committee had before it, as basic documents, the proposed programme 
budget for the biennium 1976-1977 1/ and the medium-term plan for the period 1976-
1979 2/ submitted by the Secretary~General, as well as the related report of 
the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions on the pr~posed

appropriation sections were considered on the basis of subseQUent reports of the 
Secretary-General and the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary 
Questions. 

GENERAL DEBATE 

5. The general debate on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1976-
1977 and the medium-term plan for the period 1976-1979 is reflected in the summary 
records of the Committee (A/C.5/SR.l70D-l712) during the period 25 September to 
13 October 1975. 

6. Oral statements were made by the Secretary-General (A/C.5/l685) and by the 
Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions 
(A/C.5/l686) at the l700th meeting on 25 September 1975. 

7. Certain delegations reiterated their long-standing reservations regarding 
inclusion in the budget estimates, under section 24, of expenditure relating to 
the payment of interest and principal on the United Nations bond issue. Certain 
delegations also reaffirmed their position regarding section 15 (Regular programme 
of technical assistance); they believed that technical assistance activities 
should be financed exclusively from voluntary contributions. 

DECISIONS TAKEN IN FIRST READING 

Section 3. Political affairs, trusteeship and decolonization 

8. At the l740th meeting, on 14 November, the representative of Algeria, 
commenting on the estimates for the Department of Political Affairs, Trusteeship 
and Decolonization in first reading, stressed the importance of the work performed 
by the Department and introduced a draft decision (A/C.5/L.l25l) proposing that 
the tasks of the Africa Division should be related more closely to ~uestions 
concerning the decolonization of southern Africa. 

DECISION OF Trill FIFTH CO~~ITTEE 

9. At its 1746th meeting, on 24 November, the Committee decided, without 
objection, to include in its report the following text proposed by Algeria and to 
recommend it for adoption by the General Assembly: 

"The Fifth Committee considers it vitally important that the tasks of 
the Africa Division should be related more closely to ~uestions concerning 
the decolonization of southern Africa, in view of the new political 
situation prevailing in the region" (see para. 224 (e.) below).

Section 6. Economic Commission for Europe 

10. When the Committee discussed this section in first reading at its l718th 
meeting, on 21 October, some delegations, supporting the decreases recommended 
by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, pointed out 
that the estimates for the Economic Commission for Europe were considerably 
higher than those for the other regional commissions. Other delegations, however, 
supported the original estimates submitted by the Secretary-General. In their 
opinion the reductions recommended had not taken into account the many tasks of 
the Commission, especially the new economic co-operation tasks entrusted to it 
as a result of decisions taken by the Conference on Security and Co-operation 
in Europe, which was concluded at Helsinki on l August 1975. 

11. One of these latter delegations, while suggesting, in the first instance, 
a redeployment to this section of resources assigned to other completed or marginal 
activities, asked for assurances that the work of the Commission would not suffer 
as a result of the recommended reductions. 

12. The representative of the Secretary-General stated that although the 
reductions proposed by the Advisory Committee would make it difficult, the 
secretariat would do its utmost to carry out the tasks entrusted to the Commission. 

Section 7. Economic and Social Commission for 
Asia and the Pacific 

13. When the Committee discussed this section, in first reading, at its l718th 
and l719th meetings, on 21 and 22 October, some delegations were concerned with 
regard to the deduction recommended by the Advisory Committee on Administrative 
and Budgetary Questions in the appropriation requested for new posts for the 
Commission by the Secretary-General, and, more especially, with regard to the 
further 5 per cent turnover deduction on vacant posts recommended by that Committee. 

DECISION OF THE FIFTH COMMITTEE 

14. At the l719th meeting, on 22 October, on the proposal of Australia, the 
Fifth Committee decided, without objection, to include the following recommendation 
in its report to the General Assembly: 

"The Fifth Committee decides to adopt the recommendations made by the 
Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions under section 7 
on the understanding that, in the event that the recruitment situation 
improves beyond the present projection, the General Assembly, at its thirty-
first session, will consider supplementary requests for additional credits 
for the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific based on a 
new turnover factor calculated on the basis of such improvement in the 
recruitment situation" (see para. 224 (b) below),

Section 8. Economic Commission for Latin America 

15. The Committee considered this section in first reading at its l71'9th and 
l720th meetings, on 22 and 23 October. In the course of the discussion, some 
delegations could not agree with the reductions recommended by the Advisory 
Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. Other delegations pointed 
out that those reductions related mainly to the additional turnover factor applied 
by the Advisory Committee to the large number of vacant posts which existed in 
the Economic Commission for Latin America. 

DECISION OF THE FIFTH COMMITTEE 

16. At the l720th meeting, on 23 October 1975, on the proposal of Japan, the 
Fifth Committee decided, without objection, to recommend that the General Assembly 
should approve the appropriation recommended by the Advisory Committee on 
Administrative and Budgetary Questions for the Economic Commission for Latin 
America on the understanding that, if progress was made in recruiting personnel 
to fill vacant posts and in executing the prograrr@e, the Secretary-General would 
submit, at the thirty-first session of the General Assembly, a request for 
additional c"ppropriations (sPe para. 224 (c) below). 

Section 10. Economic Commission for V/estern Asia 

17. The Committee considered this section in first reading at its l720th meeting, 
on 23 October. During the discussion, some delegations stressed the fact that 
the Economic Commission for Vlestern Asia had only recently been established. 
They pointed out that every effort should be made to help it to achieve its goals 
and to carry out its important initial activities which were consistent with the 
special economic needs of the region; for those reasons, they could not agree 
to the reductions recommended by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and 
Budgetary Questions. 

DECISION OF THE FIFTH COMMITTEE 

18. At the l720th meeting, on 23 October, the Committee decided, without 
objection, to recommend that the General Assembly should approve the appropriation 
for the l:conomic Commission for \)estern Asia, as recommended by the Advisory 
Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, on the understanding that 
the Secretary-General would report to the General Assembly, at its thirty-first 
session, on the implementation of the Commission's programmes and, if in the 
light of that report, additional resources should be required, the Fifth Committee 
would consider the approval of supplementary estimates for the Commission (see 
para. 224 (d) below).

English 
Page 5 

19. During the first reading of the proposed estimates for section 13 (United 
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)), a number of delegations, intervening in 
the discussion, supported the comments of the Advisory Committee on Administrative 
and Budgetary Questions in paragraphs 13.5 and 13.7-13.10 of its first report 
on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1976-1977. ~ 

20. In the above-mentioned paragraphs, the Advisory Committee commented on the 
high rate of growth of the administrative and programme support costs of UNEP 
financed from the Environment Fund; expressed reservations concerning the level 
of many of the proposed posts for the biennium 1976-1977; emphasized the need 
for interorganization co-ordination and harmonization of environment programme 
activities; commented on the magnitude of the estimates for temporary assistance 
for meetings and the need to effect economies with respect to such expenditure; 
and considered that savings could be achieved in the estimates for communications 
as a result of the installation of the United Nations radio station facilities 
in Nairobi. 

DECISION OF THE FIFTH CO/IliviiTTEE 

21. At its l713th meeting, on 14 October, the Fifth Committee decided, without 
objection, to recommend that the General Assembly should: 

(a) Take note of the comments and observations of the Advisory Committee on 
Administrative and Budgetary Questions in paragraphs 13.5 and 13.7-13.10 of its 
report; ~ 

(b) Req_uest the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme 
to take account of those recommendations and observations in the administration 
and management of its programmes; 

(c) Req_uest the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions 
to follow up on this matter as indicated in its report ~ (see para. 224 (e) 
below). 

Section 14. International Narcotics Control 

22. During the first reading of the proposed estimates for section 14 
(International Narcotics Control), some delegations associated themselves with 
the concern expressed by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary 
Questions in paragraph 14.12 of its first report on the proposed programme budget

for the biennium 1976-1977 5/ regarding the possible overlapping and duplication 
of the activities of the secretariats of the International Narcotics Control 
Board and the Division of Narcotic Drugs, respectively. 

DECISION OF THE FIFTH CO~~ITTEE 

23. At its l706th meeting, on 6 October, the Fifth Committee decided, without 
objection, to recommend that the General Assembly should: 

(a) Concur with the observations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative 
and Budgetary Questions contained in paragraph 14.12 of its report; 21 

(b) Request the Economic and Social Council to examine the programme aspects 
of the present secretariats of the International Narcotics Control Board and 
the Division of Narcotic Drugs with a view to identifying any duplication and 
overlapping of activities that might exist, and to consider, within this context, 
the possibility of streamlining or combining both secretariats in the interest 
of economy and expeditious administration and management (see para. 224 (f) 
below). 

Section 17. Office of the United Nations Disaster 
Relief Co-ordinator 

24. The Committee discussed the estimates for this section in first reading at 
its l737th and l745th meetings, on 12 and 21 November, at which time it had for 
its consideration the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of 
emergency relief assistance and technical co-operation activities (A/C.5/l688 and 
Corr.l) and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and 
Budgetary Questions (A/l0008/Add.5). 

25. The following draft resolution (A/C.5/L.l254) proposed by the Chairman was 
also before the Committee: 

"The General Assembly, 

"Taking note of the Secretary-General's report (A/C.5/l688 and Corr.l) 
and the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary 
Questions thereon (A/l0008/Add.5). 

"l. Decides to establish two new subaccounts within the existing 
voluntary Trust Fund established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 
3243 (XXIX) for strengthening the United Nations Disaster Relief Office 
with separate target figures for the biennium 1976-1977 of:

"(b) ~600,000 for programme costs of Technical Assistance in pre-disaster 
planning and prevention; 

"2. Authorizes the Secretary-General, subject to availability of 
voluntary funds as referred to above, to increase progressively up to a 
maximum of $30,000 the amount of emergency assistance per country for any 
one disaster; 

11 3. Requests the Secretary-General to report annually to the General 
Assembly on the status of the fund. 0 

26. At the 1745th meeting, the representative of the Philippines orally proposed 
that the words ''pre-disaster planning and prevention" in paragraph 1 (b) of the 
draft resolution be replaced by "disaster prevention and pre-disaster planning 
assistance to Governments", and that the word 11fundn in paragraph 3 be replaced 
by "Trust Fund". 

DECISION OF THE FIFTH COMMITTEE 

27. At its 1745th meeting, on 21 November, the Committee adopted, by 79 votes 
to 9, with no abstentions, the draft resolution (A/C.5/L.l254) as amended by the 
Philippines (see para. 223 below, draft resolution I). 

Section 22. Administration, management and general services 

28. The Committee considered section 22 (Administration, management and general 
services) at its 1713th, 1715th to 1717th and 1725th meetings, on 14, 16, 17, 20 
and 30 October, respectively. 

29. After considering separately each of the subsections of section 22, as well 
as the section as a whole, the Committee decided to express its support with 
respect to certain paragraphs in the report of the Advisory Committee on 
Administrative and Budgetary Questions §! concerning this section. 

30. In paragraph 22.34 of its report the Advisory Committee, referring to the 
New York Computing Centre, recommended that the Secretary-General should submit 
to the General Assembly, in the context of his progress report on the programme 
budget, inter alia, a clear and concise account of developments in electronic 
data processing and information systems since the twenty-eighth session of the 
Assembly with a forecast of requirements tied to the medium-term plan of the 
Organization.

31. In paragraph 22.38, the Advisory Committee, while not objecting to the 
estimates for the Inter-Organization Board for Information Systems (IOB) included 
in subsection 22D (Electronic Data Processing and Information Systems Service), 
believed that the size of the budget of IOB called for a review of future estimates 
by the General Assembly instead of only by the Administrative Committee on 
Co-ordination. 

32. In paragraph 22.54, the Advisory Conm!ittee referred to the use of the Medical 
Service of the United Nations by UNDP, UNIC:O:F and other units funded from 
extrabudgetary funds, and recommended that the Secretary-General study the question 
in consultation with the organizations concerned and submit to the General 
Assembly proposals for a more equitable distribution of the related costs based 
on the services provided. 

33. In paragraph 22.60, the Advisory Committee recommended non-acceptance of the 
estimates requested by the Secretary-General for providing temporary computer 
services to the Geneva Office pending the development of an interactive system 
with the International Computing Centre, and recommended instead that the 
Secretary-General include in his report referred to in paragraph 30 above the 
possible implications of the development of an interactive system. 

34. In paragraph 22.82, the Advisory Committee trusted that the Secretary-General 
would periodically review the volume of the services provided by the 
Communications, Archives and Records Service so as to ensure that the number of 
posts provided from extrabudgetary resources is commensurate with the volume of 
work involved. 

35. In paragraph 22.91, the Advisory Committee, referring to the insufficient 
manpower resources made available from voluntary funds, recommended that the 
Secretary-General study this question on the basis of recent trends and projections 
over several years and seek from the voluntary programmes concerned a more 
equitable sharing of the costs involved. 

DECISION OF THE FIFTH COMMITTEE 

36. At its l725th meeting, on 30 October, the Committee decided, without 
objection, to recommend that the General Assembly should concur with the 
recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions 
appearing in paragraphs 22.34, 22.38, 22.54, 22.60, 22.82 and 22.91 of its first 
report on the proposed programme budget '")r the biennium 1976-1977 7/ (see

Page 9 

37. In the course of the first reading of section 23 (Conference and Library 
Services), the representative of Belgium orally proposed that the amount 
recommended by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions 
in respect of section 23 for the biennium 1976-1977 be reduced by ~1.5 million, 
it being understood that the reduction should be applied specifically to 
expenditure in publications and documentation. In so doing, he explained that 
the proposal of his delegation was based upon the decision taken by the Committee 
earlier in the session in paragraph 2 of draft resolution A/C.5/L.l278, submitted 
under agenda item 101 (Publications and documentation). 

38. At its 1763rd meeting, on 8 December, the Committee rejected the Belgian 
proposal by 42 votes to 20, with 18 abstentions. 

39. The discussion which took place on the Belgian proposal is reflected in the 
summary records of the Committee (A/C.5/SR.l760 and 1763).

Revis_ed estimates for section 12. United Nations Industrial 
Development Organization (UNIDO) 

40. The Committee considered in first reading the revised estimates for the 
United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) submitted by the 
Secretary-General in document A/C.5/l715/Rev.l. The original estimates for UNIDO 
for 1976-1977, which appeared in section 12 of the Secretary-General's proposed 
progr~~e budget for the biennium l976-l97G§/ were prepared before the Second 
General Conference of UNIDO, held at Lima from 12 to 26 March 1975, which adopted 
the Lima Declaration and Plan of Action on Industrial Development and Co-operation 
(A/10112). That Declaration and Plan of Action called for a strengthening and 
restructuring of UNIDO and imposed additional responsibilities upon UNIDO. 

41. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, in its 
first report on the proposed programme budget for 1976-1977, 21 decided, in view 
of the fact that the UNIDO estimates would be subject to fundamental revision, 
to postpone detailed consideration of section 12 until its autumn 1975 session. 

42. The Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary 
Questions introduced the Advisory Committee's report (A/l0008/Add.20) containing 
its comments on the revised estimates for section 12 submitted by the Secretary-
General (A/C.5/l715/Rev.l) in an oral statement before the Committee. 

43. At the l770th meeting, on 13 December, the representative of the Upper Volta 
proposed the following draft resolution (A/C.5/L.l292) on behalf of Iran, the 
Ivory Coast, Trinidad and Tobago and the Upper Volta: 

01 'rhe General Assembly, 

''Recognizing the vital significance and importance of the Lima 
Declaration and Plan of Action on Industrial Development and Co-operation for 
the industrialization of the developing countries, 

"Noting with regret that the submission made by the Secretary-General in 
his revised estimates for the United Nations Industrial Development 
Organization (A/C.5/l715/Rev.l) provides insufficient information on the 
relationship behrcen the resources therein requested and the programmes 
stemming from the Lima Declaration, 

"l. Accepts the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on 
Administrative and Budgetary Questions regarding the estimates submitted by 
the Secretary-General in his report A/C.5/l715/Rev.l; 

11 2. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly 
at its thirty-first session rev~sed estimates for the United Nations

Industrial Development Organization taking fully into account all elements 
of the Lima Declaration and indicating clearly the resulting progrrumne 
requirements and the related resources." 

The deler;ation of Chad subsequently joined the list of sponsors. 

44. At the lTTlst meeting, on 15 December, the representative of Peru proposed 
the following amendments to the draft resolution (A/C.5/L.l292): 

(a) To insert, as the second preambular paragraph, the following paragraph: 

"Reaffirming General Assembly resolution 3362 (S-VII) which endorsed 
the Lima Declaration and Plan of Action on Industrial Development and 
Co-operation"; 

(b) To replace, in operative paragraph 2, the words "taking fully" by the 
words "providing a considerable increase which would fully take ... ". 

45. The representative of Upper Volta, on behalf of the co-sponsors of the draft 
resolution (A/C.5/L.l292), accepted the first amendment proposed by Peru as the 
first preambular paragraph of the draft decision. The co-sponsors however, 
could not accept the second amendment proposed by Peru. 

46. The representative of Peru then withdrew the second amendment proposed by 
his delegation stating that it was doing so in order to facilitate a consensus on 
the draft resolution (A/C.5/L.l292). 

4T. A separate vote was requested on each of the two operative paragraphs of the 
draft resolution (A/C.5/L.l292). 

48. At the lTTlst meeting, on 14 December, the Committee voted on the draft 
resolution (A/C.5/L.l292) as follows: 

(a) Operative paragraph 1 was adopted by 82 votes to one, with 8 abstentions; 

(b) Operative paragraph 2 was adopted by 84 votes to none, with 6 abstentions; 

(c) The draft resolution as a whole, as amended by Peru, was adopted by 
83 votes to none, with 9 abstentions (see para. 223 below, draft resolution II). 

49. The comments made in the course of the discussion of this question as well 
as the explanations of vote are reflected in the summary records of the 
Committee (A/C.5/SR.lTT0 and lTTl).

OTHER DECISIONS 

50. In the course of the examination of individual sections of the budget in 
first reading, the Committee took a number of decisions of a broader nature which 
related to the proposed programme budget as a whole. 

51. At the 1747th meeting, on 24 November, the draft decisions set forth 1n 
paragraphs 52 to 54 below were introduced to the Committee. 

52. The representative of New Zealand introduced the following draft decision 
(A/C.5/L.l238): 

"The Fifth Committee, having in mind the Secretary-General's appeal 
to Member States to help ease the cash-flow position of the United Nations 
Organization by forwarding their assessed contributions more promptly 
(A/C.5/l685 of 25 September 1975), and in view of the complex tasks 
envisaged for the Organization under resolution 3362 (S-VII) of the 
seventh special session, requests the Secretary-General to resume, from 
30 September 1975 and on a regular and at least quarterly basis thereafter, 
publication of a document showing, for each Nember State, amounts assessed, 
paid and owing to the regular budget and on continuing operations for which 
there is a special assessment. The document should be made available to 
all Member States and should contain essentially the same information as 
that published in document A/5822, last issued on 30 November 1964." 

53. The representative of Cuba introduced the following draft decision 
(A/C.5/L.l232): 

"The Fifth Committee recommends that the General Assembly decide that 
the implications of inflation and currency instability for the United Nations 
budget should not be included in the budget for the biennium 1976-1977 under 
the policy of full budgeting, but should be submitted subsequently in 
supplementary estimates at the end of each financial year, since they 
constitute extraordinary expenses whose amount it is difficult to foresee 
and their inclusion in the regular budget of the United Nations imposes a 
burden on the majority of Member States by requiring them to pay for such 
expenses in advance. 11 

54. The representative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics introduced the 
following three draft decisions (A/C.5/L.l229, A/C.5/L.l230 and A/C.5/L.l233): 

(a) ''J'he General Assembly supports the opinion expressed by the Advisory 
Committee in paragraph 28 of its first report 10/ that programme increases 
should follow rather than precede action by the-legislative organs, and 
proposes that the requirements laid down in rules 153 and 154 of the rules 
of procedure of the General Assembly should in future be strictly observed. 11

Republic of Germany, supnorted by Belgium, Greece, New Zealand and the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, requested the following information: 

(a) The amounts which would be required under the various sections of the 
programme budget for the biennium 1976-1977, taking into account the related 
recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions 
and assuming average annual rates of further inflation in 1976 and 1977 at levels 
2 to 3 percentage points below those applied to the initial estimates submitted by 
the Secretary-General; 

(b) An indication of the manner in which the over-all reduction resulting 
from the application of such lower inflation rates could be distributed among 
various sections of the budget, on a priority rather than on an across-the-board 
basis and assuming, to this end, that programmes with recent legislative authority 
and programmes directly benefiting Member States, in particular developing 
countries, should have priority over older programmes, programmes with less 
tangible impact and administrative and support activities. 

178. At the l764th meeting, on 8 December, the Controller, in an oral statement 
before the Committee, introduced a working paper submitted by the Secretariat in 
answer to the above-mentioned request. 

179. After considerable discussion at the l766th meeting, the Controller made an 
oral statement in which he transmitted to the Committee the results of the 
re-examination of the inflation and currency fluctuation assumptions made by the 
Secretary-General when preparing his initial estimates for the biennium 1976-1977. 
In so doing, he stated, inter alia, that he had provided the Committee with the 
most reliable evidence available and that it was up to the Committee to judge 
whether it considered that evidence acceptable and whether it would be advisable 
for the appropriate adjustments to be made in the budget estimates at the current 
session; whatever decision the Committee might take, he would endeavour to continue 
to manage the total funds approved with the utmost care. In this latter connexion, 
he drew the attention of the Committee to the final performance report in respect 
of 1974-1975 (A/C.5/l710) which illustrated the manner in which management 
procedures contributed to keeping to a minimum the net additional appropriations 
requested before a financial period ended. 

180. At the l770th meeting, on 13 December, the representative of New Zealand 
proposed the following draft decision (A/C.5/L.l293): 

"The Fifth Committee recommends to the General Assembly that it: 

'Decide to request the Secretary-General, in preparing the final revised 
estimates for the programme budget 1976-1977, to base his assumptions with 
regard to the rate of inflation in each year of the biennium on the latest 
available forecasts, and for currency alignments on the actual rates 
prevailing at the time the documents are prepared.'"

orally proposed that in the phrase "on t'1e l2"test available forecasts ' the vord 
11the" be replaced by "his" o 

182. The representative of the Upper Volta proposed that the following paragraph 
(A/C.5/L.l294) be added to the New Zealand draft decision (A/C.5/L.l293): 

"Further decides that consequential adjustments shall be made in the 
performance reports of 1976 and 1977 to take into account actual rates of 
inflation and currency fluctuations." 

183. The representative of Greece orally proposed that in the New Zealand draft 
decision (A/C.5/L.l293) the words "with regard to the rate of inflation in each year 
of the biennium on the latest available forecasts, and" be deleted. 

184. The representative of Greece subsequently withdrew his proposal. 

185. The representative of New Zealand accepted the amendments proposed by the 
United Kingdom and the Upper Volta. 

186. After some discussion, at its l770th meeting, on 13 December, the Committee

Volta (A/C.5/L.l294) and as orally amended by the United Kingdom, by 61 votes to 
8, with 5 abstentions (see para. 188 below). 

187. The comments made by delegations in the course of the discussion of this 
subject as well as the statements made by the Controller are reflected in the
