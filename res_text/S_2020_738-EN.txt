 The Security Council, 

 Recalling all of its previous resolutions, statements of its President, and press 

statements on the situation in the Central African Republic (CAR),  

 Welcoming the efforts made by the CAR authorities, in coordination with their 

international partners, to advance the reform of the security sector (SSR), including 

the ongoing deployment of CAR defence and security forces, encouraging them to 

implement their National Defence Plan, Force Employment Concept, and National 

Security Policy, and acknowledging the urgent need for the CAR authorities to train 

and equip their defence and security forces to be able to respond proportionately to 

threats to the security of all citizens in the CAR,  

 Welcoming also the commitment demonstrated and the progress made by the 

CAR authorities, along with their international partners, to achieve the key 

benchmarks for the review of the arms embargo measures, through inter alia 

suspension or progressive lifting of these measures, established in the statement of its 

President of 9 April 2019 (S/PRST/2019/3) (“the key benchmarks”) and taking note 

of the letter of the CAR authorities addressed to the President of the Security Council 

(S/2020/57),  

 Stressing the importance of the CAR authorities achieving the key benchmarks 

in order to contribute to the advancement of the SSR process, the disarmament, 

demobilisation, reintegration and repatriation (DDRR) process and necessary 

weapons and ammunition management reforms and encouraging the CAR authorities 

to maintain their efforts and continue their progress in this regard,  

 Recalling that deliveries of weapons, ammunition and military equipment and 

the provision of technical assistance or training, to the CAR security forces and 

intended solely for support of or use in the CAR process of SSR, by Member States 

or international, regional and subregional organisations should only be used for the 

purposes specified in the relevant notifications and exemption requests and 

underlining their contribution to the development of CAR security sector institutions, 

to the response to the specific needs of the CAR defence and security forces, and to 

the support to the progressive extension of State authority,  

 Stressing the need for the CAR authorities to ensure physical protection, control, 

management, traceability, and accountability of weapons, ammunition and military 

equipment transferred to their control,  

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 16 June 2020 (S/2020/545) 

submitted pursuant to resolution 2499 (2019),
