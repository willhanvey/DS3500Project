1
 in which 

States were requested to take all possible steps to prevent pollution of the seas,  

 Emphasizing the need to protect and preserve the marine environment in 

accordance with international law,  

 Taking into account the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and 

Development,
2
 especially principle 16, in which it was stipulated that the polluter 

should, in principle, bear the cost of pollution, and taking into account also chapter 

17 of Agenda 21,
3
 

 Noting with great concern the environmental disaster caused by the 

destruction by the Israeli Air Force on 15 July 2006 of the oil storage tanks in the 

direct vicinity of El-Jiyeh electric power plant in Lebanon, resulting in an oil slick 

that covered the entirety of the Lebanese coastline, extended to the Syrian coastline 

and hindered efforts to achieve sustainable development, as already highlighted by

the General Assembly in its resolutions 61/194, 62/188, 63/211, 64/195, 65/147, 

66/192, 67/201, 68/206, 69/212, 70/194 and 71/218, 

 Noting that the Secretary-General expressed grave concern at the lack of any 

acknowledgement on the part of the Government of Israel of its responsibilities 

vis-à-vis reparations and compensation to the Government and people of Lebanon 

and the Syrian Arab Republic affected by the oil spill,  

 Recalling that, in paragraph 5 of its resolution 71/218, it reiterated its request 

to the Government of Israel to assume responsibility for prompt and adequate 

compensation to the Government of Lebanon and other countries directly affected 

by the oil slick, such as the Syrian Arab Republic, whose shores have been partially 

polluted, and recognizing the conclusion of the Secretary-General that this request 

of the General Assembly has yet to be implemented,  

 Acknowledging that the Secretary-General concluded that this oil spill is not 

covered by any of the international oil spill compensation funds and thus merits 

special consideration, and recognizing that further consideration needs to be given 

to the option of securing the relevant compensation from the Government of Israel,  

 Acknowledging also the conclusions on measuring and quantifying the 

environmental damage set out in the report of the Secretary-General,
4
 

 Noting again with appreciation the assistance offered by donor countries and 

international organizations for the clean-up operations and the early recovery and 

reconstruction of Lebanon through bilateral and multilateral channels, including the 

Athens Coordination Meeting on the response to the marine pollution incident in the 

Eastern Mediterranean, held on 17 August 2006, as well as the Stockholm 

Conference for Lebanon’s Early Recovery, held on 31 August 2006,  

 Acknowledging that the Secretary-General has welcomed the agreement of the 

Lebanon Recovery Fund to host the Eastern Mediterranean Oil Spill Restoration 

Trust Fund, under its existing mechanism, and expressing concern that to date no 

contributions have been made to the Trust Fund,  

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;
4
 

 2. Reiterates, for the twelfth consecutive year, its deep concern about the 

adverse implications of the destruction by the Israeli Air Force of the oil storage 

tanks in the direct vicinity of the Lebanese El-Jiyeh electric power plant for the 

achievement of sustainable development in Lebanon;  

 3. Considers that the oil slick has heavily polluted the shores of Lebanon 

and partially polluted Syrian shores and consequently has had serious implications 

for livelihoods and the economy of Lebanon, owing to the adverse implications for 

natural resources, biodiversity, fisheries and tourism, and for human health in the  

country; 

 4. Acknowledges the conclusions in the report of the Secretary-General, in 

which he stated that studies show that the value of the damage to Lebanon amounted 

to 856.4 million United States dollars in 2014, and requests the Secretary -General to 

urge United Nations bodies and agencies and other relevant organizations involved 

in the initial assessment of the relevant environmental damage to undertake, within 

existing resources, a further study, building on, inter alia, the initial work of the 

World Bank presented in the report of the Secretary-General submitted to the

General Assembly at its sixty-second session,
5
 with a view to measuring and 

quantifying the environmental damage sustained by neighbouring countries;  

 5. Reiterates its request in this regard to the Government of Israel to 

assume responsibility for prompt and adequate compensation to the Government of 

Lebanon for the aforementioned damage and to other countries directly affected by 

the oil slick, such as the Syrian Arab Republic, whose shores have been partially 

polluted, for the costs of repairing the environmental damage caused by the 

destruction, including the restoration of the marine environment, in particular in the 

light of the conclusion contained in the report of the Secretary -General that there 

remains grave concern at the lack of implementation of the relevant provisions of 

the resolutions of the General Assembly on the subject vis-à-vis reparations and 

compensation to the Government and people of Lebanon and the Syrian Arab 

Republic affected by the oil spill; 

 6. Reiterates its appreciation for the efforts of the Government of Lebanon 

and those of Member States, regional and international organizations, regional and 

international financial institutions, non-governmental organizations and the private 

sector in the initiation of clean-up and rehabilitation operations on the polluted 

shores, and encourages Member States and the above-mentioned entities to continue 

their financial and technical support to the Government of Lebanon towards 

achieving the completion of clean-up and rehabilitation operations, with the aim of 

preserving the ecosystem of Lebanon and that of the Eastern Mediterranean Basin;  

 7. Welcomes the agreement of the Lebanon Recovery Fund to host the 

Eastern Mediterranean Oil Spill Restoration Trust Fund, based on voluntary 

contributions, to provide assistance and support to the States directly and adversely 

affected in their integrated environmentally sound management, from clean -up to 

safe disposal of oily waste, of this environmental disaster resulting from the 

destruction of the oil storage tanks at El-Jiyeh electric power plant; 

 8. Notes that in his report the Secretary-General urged Member States, 

international organizations, international and regional financial  institutions, 

non-governmental organizations and the private sector to intensify their support for 

Lebanon in this matter, particularly for recovery and rehabilitation activities on the 

Lebanese coast, reiterates its invitation to States and the international donor 

community to make voluntary financial contributions to the Trust Fund, and in this 

regard requests the Secretary-General to mobilize international technical and 

financial assistance in order to ensure that the Trust Fund has sufficient and 

adequate resources; 

 9. Recognizes the multidimensionality of the adverse impact of the oil slick, 

and requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its 

seventy-third session a report on the implementation of the present resolution under 

the item entitled “Sustainable development”.
