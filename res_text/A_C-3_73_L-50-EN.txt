 Strongly condemning the grave human rights situation in the Syrian Arab 

Republic, the indiscriminate killing and deliberate targeting of civilians as such, 

including those involving the continued indiscriminate use of heavy weapons and 

aerial bombardments, which has caused more than 400,000 fatalities, including the 

killing of more than 17,000 children, the continued widespread and systematic gross 

violations, as well as abuses, of human rights and violations of international 

humanitarian law, including by the starvation of civilians as a method of warfare and 

the use of chemical weapons, including chlorine gas, sarin and sulfur mustard, which 

are prohibited under international law, and acts of violence that foment sectarian 

tensions by the Syrian authorities against the Syrian population,  

 Reiterating that the only sustainable solution to the current crisis in the Syrian 

Arab Republic is through an inclusive and Syrian-led political process, under the 

auspices of the United Nations, that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian 

people and the establishment of a constitutional committee that would prepare the 

work for free and fair elections and political transition in line with Security Council

3/13 18-18305 

 

resolution 2254 (2015), with a view to establishing credible, inclusive and 

non-sectarian governance, with the full and meaningful participation of  women, 

reaffirming in this regard the important role of women in the prevention and 

resolution of conflicts and in peacebuilding, and stressing the importance of their 

equal participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and 

promotion of peace and security and the need to increase their role in decision-making 

with regard to conflict prevention and resolution,  

 Expressing its full support for the efforts of the Special Envoy for Syria to 

establish urgently a credible and legitimate constitutional committee to advance the 

efforts of the United Nations to achieve a sustainable political solution to the conflict 

in the Syrian Arab Republic in line with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), and 

recalling that pursuant to Council resolution 2254 (2015) a political solution to the 

conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic also comprises free and fair elections, under the 

supervision of the United Nations, to the satisfaction of the governance and to the 

highest international standards of transparency and accountability, with all Syrians, 

including displaced persons and refugees, eligible to participate, as well as the 

establishment of a neutral and safe environment,  

 Reconfirming its endorsement of the Geneva communiqué of 30 June 2012, 

endorsing the joint statement on the outcome of the multilateral talks on Syri a held in 

Vienna of 30 October 2015 and the statement of the International Syria Support Group 

of 14 November 2015 (“the Vienna statements”) in pursuit of the full implementation 

of the Geneva communiqué, facilitated by the Special Envoy, as the basis for a Syrian-

led and Syrian-owned political transition in order to end the conflict in the Syrian 

Arab Republic, and stressing that the Syrian people will decide the future of Syria,  

 Noting with deep concern the culture of impunity for the most serious violations 

of international law and violations and abuses of human rights law committed during 

the present conflict, which has provided a fertile ground for further violations and 

abuses,  

 Recalling that, amid expressions of popular discontent over restrictions on the 

enjoyment of civil, political, economic and social rights, civilian protests erupted in 

Dar’a in March 2011, and noting that the violent oppression of civilian protests by 

the Syrian authorities, which later escalated to the direct shelling of civi lians, fuelled 

the escalation of armed violence and violent extremist groups, and terrorist groups, 

including so-called ISIL (also known as Da’esh), Nusrah Front (also known as Hay’at 

Tahrir al-Sham), Al-Qaida-affiliated terrorist groups, and all other individuals, 

groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida or ISIL so designated by 

the Security Council, and other violent extremist groups,   

 Recalling also the specific obligations under international humanitarian law to 

respect and protect, in situations of armed conflict, medical personnel and 

humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means of 

transport and equipment, and hospitals and other medical facilities, and to ensure that 

the wounded and sick receive, to the fullest extent practicable and with the least 

possible delay, the medical care and attention required, recalling also that, under 

international law, attacks intentionally directed against hospitals and places where the 

sick and wounded are collected, provided that they are not military objectives, as well 

as attacks intentionally directed against buildings, material, medical units and 

transport and personnel using the distinctive emblems of the Geneva Conventions of 

12 August 194929 in conformity with international law are war crimes, and recalling 

the applicable rules of international humanitarian law relating to the non-punishment 

of any person for carrying out medical activities compatible with medical ethics,

A/C.3/73/L.50 
 

 

18-18305 4/13 

 

 Expressing grave concern at the indiscriminate use of force by the Syrian 

authorities against civilians, which has caused immense human suffering and 

fomented the spread of extremism and extremist groups and which demonstrates the 

continuing failure of the Syrian authorities to protect the populatio n and implement 

the relevant resolutions and decisions of United Nations bodies and has created a safe 

haven for crimes against humanity,  

 Expressing grave concern also at the remaining presence of extremism and 

violent extremist groups, terrorism and terrorist groups, and strongly condemning all 

violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian 

law committed in the Syrian Arab Republic by any party to the conflict, in particular 

so-called ISIL (also known as Da’esh), Nusrah Front, Al-Qaida-affiliated terrorist 

groups, militias fighting on behalf of the regime and other violent extremist groups,  

 Noting with serious concern the observation of the Independent International 

Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic that non-State armed groups still 

resort to the use of force against civilians,  

 Reaffirming its condemnation in the strongest possible terms of the use of 

chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances, emphasizing that any use of 

chemical weapons anywhere, at any time, by anyone, under any circumstances, is 

unacceptable and is and would be a violation of international law, and expressing its 

strong conviction that those individuals responsible for the use of chemical weapons 

must and should be held accountable,  

 Condemning in the strongest possible terms the fact that chemical weapons have 

been used since 2012 in the Syrian Arab Republic, including as reported by the 

Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint 

Investigative Mechanism in its reports of 2016 and 2017, concluding that the Syrian 

Arab Armed Forces were responsible for the attacks which released toxic substances 

in Tallmannis in 2014 and in Sarmin and Qaminas in 2015, that ISIL (also known as 

Da'esh) used sulfur mustard in Mari‘ in 2015 and in Umm Hawsh in 2016 and that 

the Syrian Arab Republic was responsible for the release of sarin at Khan Shaykhun 

in 2017, accordingly noting with great concern the reports of the fact-finding mission 

of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons regarding alleged 

incidents in Lataminah and Saraqib, as well as its interim report regarding the alleged 

use of toxic chemicals as a weapon in Duma, and  demanding that the perpetrators 

immediately desist from any further use of chemical weapons,  

 Expressing support for the work carried out by the Independent International 

Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, welcoming its reports, strongly 

condemning the lack of cooperation by the Syrian authorities with the Commission 

of Inquiry, reiterating its decision to transmit the reports of the Commission of Inquiry 

to the Security Council, expressing its appreciation to the Commission of Inquiry for 

its briefings to members of the Security Council, and requesting that the Commission 

of Inquiry continue to brief the General Assembly and members of the Security 

Council, 

 Noting with serious concern the observation of the Commission of Inquiry that, 

since March 2011, the Syrian authorities have conducted widespread attacks against 

the civilian population as a matter of policy, including targeted attacks against 

protected persons and objects, including medical facilities, personnel and tra nsport 

and blocked humanitarian convoys, as well as enforced disappearances, torture in 

detention, summary executions and other violations and abuses, and underscoring the 

need for those allegations to be examined and evidence to be collected and made 

available for future accountability efforts,  



 
A/C.3/73/L.50 

 

5/13 18-18305 

 

 Strongly condemning the reported killing of detainees in Syrian military 

intelligence facilities and the widespread practice of enforced disappearance, 

arbitrary detention and the use of sexual and gender-based violence and torture in 

detention centres referred to in the reports of the Commission of Inquiry, including, 

but not limited to, Branch 215, Branch 227, Branch 235, Branch 251, the Air Force 

Intelligence Investigation Branch at Mazzah military airport and Saydnaya prison, 

including the reported practice of mass hangings by the authorities, as well as the 

reported killing of detainees at military hospitals, including Tishrin and Harasta 

hospitals,  

 Expressing its deepest concern about the findings of the Commission of Inquiry 

and also the allegations contained in the evidence presented by “Caesar” in January 

2014 regarding the torture and execution of persons incarcerated by the Syrian 

authorities, and underscoring the need for those allegations and similar ev idence to 

be collected, examined and made available for future accountability efforts,   

 Recalling the statements made by the Secretary-General, the United Nations 

High Commissioner for Human Rights and the special procedures of the Human 

Rights Council that crimes against humanity and war crimes are likely to have been 

committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, noting the repeated encouragement by the 

High Commissioner for the Security Council to refer the situation to the International 

Criminal Court, and regretting that a draft resolution 30  was not adopted 

notwithstanding broad support from Member States,  

 Noting with concern the existence and application of Law No. 10/2018 in the 

national legislation of the Syrian Arab Republic and similar measures, which would 

have a significant detrimental impact on the rights of Syrians displaced by the conflict 

to claim their property and to return to their homes in a safe, voluntary and dignified 

manner when the situation on the ground allows it, and calling for its immediate 

repeal,  

 Expressing concern that the implementation of Security Council resolutions 

2139 (2014), 2165 (2014), 2191 (2014), 2254 (2015), 2258 (2015), 2268 (2016), 2286 

(2016), 2393 (2017) and 2401 (2018) remains largely unfulfilled, and noting the 

urgent need to strengthen efforts to address the humanitarian situation in the Syrian 

Arab Republic, including through protection of civilians and full, immediate, 

unimpeded and sustained humanitarian access,  

 Recalling its commitment to Security Council resolutions 2170 (2014), 2178 

(2014) and 2253 (2015) of 17 December 2015,  

 Alarmed that more than 5.6 million refugees, including more than 3.8 million 

women and children, have been forced to flee the Syrian Arab Republic and that 

13.6 million people in the Syrian Arab Republic, of whom 6.5 million are internally 

displaced, require urgent humanitarian assistance, which has resulted in an influx of 

Syrian refugees into neighbouring countries, other countries in the region and beyond, 

and alarmed at the risk the situation presents to regional and international stability,  

 Expressing its profound indignation at the death of more than 17,000 children 

and the many more injured since the beginning of the peaceful protests in March 2011, 

and at all grave violations and abuses committed against children in contravention of 

applicable international law, such as their recruitment and use, killing and maiming, 

sexual violence, kidnapping and abductions, attacks on schools and hospitals, and 

denial of humanitarian access, as well as their arbitrary arrest, detention, torture and 

ill-treatment and their use as human shields,

report entitled “Out of sight, out of mind: deaths in detention in the Syrian Arab

State, with the full and effective participation of women, where there is no room for 

sectarianism or discrimination on ethnic, religious, linguistic, gender or any other 

grounds, and where all persons receive equal protection, regardless of gender, religion 

or ethnicity, and further demands that all parties work urgently towards the 

comprehensive implementation of the final communiqué, including through the 

establishment of an inclusive transitional governing body with full executive powers, 

which shall be formed on the basis of mutual consent while ensuring the continuity 

of governmental institutions.
