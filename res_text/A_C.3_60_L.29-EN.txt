language or religion,

Recalling the relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights in this

Welcoming the progress achieved in the follow-up to the Durban Declaration
and Programme of Action,

Noting with regret the cancellation of the meeting entitled “Civilization and
harmony: values and mechanisms of the global order” which was to be held in
Turkey in 2004 as a follow-up to the Organization of the Islamic Conference-
European Union Joint Forum on Civilizations and Harmony: the Political
Dimension, held in Istanbul on 12 and 13 February 2002, underscoring that such
initiatives to deepen dialogue and reinforce understanding among the two biggest
groups of nations of Eurasia and Africa will be continued,

Reaffirming that discrimination against human beings on the grounds of
religion or belief constitutes an affront to human dignity and a disavowal of the
principles of the Charter,

Convinced that religious and cultural diversity in a globalizing world needs to
be used as a vehicle for creativity, dynamism and promoting social justice, tolerance
and understanding as well as international peace and security, and not as a rationale
for a new ideological and political confrontation,

Recognizing the valuable contributions of all religions to modern civilization
and the contribution that dialogue among civilizations can make to an improved
awareness and understanding of the common values shared by all humankind,

Reaffirming that cultural diversity is a cherished asset for the advancement and
welfare of humanity at large and should be valued, enjoyed, genuinely accepted and
embraced as a permanent feature that enriches our societies,

Emphasizing that States, non-governmental organizations, religious bodies and
the media have an important role to play in promoting tolerance and freedom of
religion and belief, in particular through education that teaches tolerance and respect
for religion and belief,

Alarmed at the continuing negative impact of the events of 11 September 2001
on Muslim minorities and communities in some non-Muslim countries and the
negative projection of Islam in the media, and the introduction and enforcement of
laws that specifically discriminate against and target Muslims,

Alarmed also at the serious instances of intolerance, discrimination and acts of
violence based on religion or belief, intimidation and coercion motivated by
extremism, religious or otherwise, occurring in many parts of the world and
threatening the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms,

Noting with concern that defamation of religions is among the causes of social
disharmony and leads to violations of human rights,

Noting with deep concern the increasing trend in recent years of statements
attacking religions, Islam and Muslims in particular, especially in human rights
forums,

1. Expresses deep concern at negative stereotyping of religions and
manifestations of intolerance and discrimination in matters of religion or belief still
in evidence in some regions of the world;



3

A/C.3/60/L.29

2. Strongly deplores physical attacks and assaults on businesses, cultural
centres and places of worship of all religions as well as targeting of religious
symbols;

3. Notes with deep concern the intensification of the campaign of
defamation of religions, and the ethnic and religious profiling of Muslim minorities,
in the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September 2001;

4. Expresses deep concern that Islam is frequently and wrongly associated
with human rights violations and terrorism;

5. Also expresses deep concern at programmes and agendas pursued by
extremist organizations and groups aimed at the defamation of religions, in
particular when supported by Governments;

6. Deplores the use of the print, audio-visual and electronic media,
including the Internet, and any other means to incite acts of violence, xenophobia or
related intolerance and discrimination towards Islam or any other religion;

7. Recognizes that in the context of the fight against terrorism and the
reaction to counter-terrorism measures, defamation of religions becomes an
aggravating factor that contributes to the denial of fundamental rights and freedoms
of target groups, as well as their economic and social exclusion;

8. Stresses the need to effectively combat defamation of all religions, Islam
and Muslims in particular especially in human rights forums;

9. Urges States to take resolute action to prohibit the dissemination through
political institutions and organizations of racist and xenophobic ideas and material
aimed at any religion or its followers that constitute incitement to discrimination,
hostility or violence;

10. Also urges States to provide, within their respective legal and
constitutional systems, adequate protection against acts of hatred, discrimination,
intimidation and coercion resulting from defamation of religions, to take all possible
measures to promote tolerance and respect for all religions and their value systems
and to complement legal systems with intellectual and moral strategies to combat
religious hatred and intolerance;

11. Urges all States to ensure that all public officials, including members of
law enforcement bodies, the military, civil servants and educators, in the course of
their official duties, respect different religions and beliefs and do not discriminate
on the grounds of religion or belief, and that necessary and appropriate education or
training is provided;

12. Underscores the need to combat defamation of religions by strategizing
and harmonizing actions at local, national, regional and international levels through
education and awareness-raising;

13. Urges States to ensure equal access to education for all, in law and in
practice, including access to free primary education for all children, both girls and
boys, and access for adults to lifelong learning and education based on respect for
human rights, diversity and tolerance without discrimination of any kind, and to
refrain from any legal or other measures leading to racial segregation in access to
schooling;



4

A/C.3/60/L.29

14. Calls upon the international community to initiate a global dialogue to
promote a culture of tolerance and peace based on respect for human rights and
religious diversity, and urges States, non-governmental organizations, religious
bodies and the print and electronic media to support and promote such a dialogue;

15. Calls upon the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to
promote and include human rights aspects in the dialogue among civilizations,
inter alia through:

(a) Integrating them into topical seminars and special debates on the positive
contributions of cultures, as well as religious and cultural diversity, including
through educational programmes, particularly the World Programme for Human
Rights Education proclaimed on 10 December 2004;4

(b) Collaboration by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Human Rights with other relevant international organizations in holding joint
conferences designed to encourage this dialogue and promote understanding of the
universality of human rights and their implementation at various levels;

16. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to it at its sixty-first session a
report on the implementation of the present resolution.
