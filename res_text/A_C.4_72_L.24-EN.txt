 Expressing deep concern also about the Israeli policy of closures and the 

imposition of severe restrictions, including through hundreds of obstacles to 

movement, checkpoints and a permit regime, all of which obstruct the freedom of 

movement of persons and goods, including medical and humanitarian goods, and the 

follow-up and access to donor-funded projects of development cooperation and 

humanitarian assistance, throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 

East Jerusalem, and impair the Territory’s contiguity, consequently violating the

care and widespread medical neglect, including for prisoners who are ill, with the 

risk of fatal consequences, and denial of family visits, that impair their well-being, 

and expressing grave concern also about the ill-treatment and harassment and all 

reports of torture of any Palestinian prisoners,  

 Expressing deep concern about the recent hunger strikes by numerous 

Palestinian prisoners in protest of the harsh conditions of their imprisonment and 

detention by the occupying Power, while taking note of agreements reached on 

conditions of detention in Israeli prisons and calling for their full and immediate 

implementation, 

 Recalling the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of 

Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules)
17

with international humanitarian law and human rights law, in order to ensure 

dignified closure in accordance with their religious beliefs and traditions,

provocation and incitement by extremist Israeli settlers and groups of armed 

settlers, especially against Palestinian civilians, including children, and their 

properties, including homes, agricultural lands and historic and religious sites, 

including in Occupied East Jerusalem, and deploring the violation of the human 

rights of Palestinians in this regard, including acts of violence leading to death and 

injury among civilians,

contribute to ending the violence and protecting the Palestinian civilian population
