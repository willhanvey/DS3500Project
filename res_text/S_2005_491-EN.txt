France, Greece, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland and United States of America: draft resolution

The Security Council,

Recalling all its previous resolutions on Lebanon, including resolutions 425
(1978) and 426 (1978) of 19 March 1978 and 1583 (2005) of 28 January 2005 as
well as the statements of its President on the situation in Lebanon, in particular the
statement of 18 June 2000 (S/PRST/2000/21),

Recalling further the letter from its President to the Secretary-General of
18 May 2001 (S/2001/500),

Recalling also the Secretary-General’s conclusion that, as of 16 June 2000,
Israel had withdrawn its forces from Lebanon in accordance with resolution 425
(1978) and met the requirements defined in the Secretary-General’s report of
22 May 2000 (S/2000/460), as well as the Secretary-General’s conclusion that the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) had essentially completed two
of the three parts of its mandate, focusing now on the remaining task of restoring
international peace and security,

Reaffirming that the Council has recognized the Blue Line as valid for the
purpose of confirming Israel’s withdrawal pursuant to resolution 425 (1978) and
that the Blue Line must be respected in its entirety,

Gravely concerned at the persistence of tension and violence along the Blue
Line, in particular the hostilities that took place in May and the grave incident on
29 June, which demonstrated once more that the situation remains volatile and
fragile, as outlined in the Secretary-General’s report of 21 July 2005 (S/2005/460),

Emphasizing once again the interim nature of UNIFIL,

Recalling its resolution 1308 (2000) of 17 July 2000,

Recalling also its resolution 1325 (2000) of 31 October 2000,

Recalling further the relevant principles contained in the Convention on the
Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel adopted on 9 December 1994,

Responding to the request of the Government of Lebanon to extend the
mandate of UNIFIL for a new period of six months presented in the letter from its
Chargé d’affaires to the United Nations of 11 July 2005 to the Secretary-General
(S/2005/444),

S/2005/491

Taking note of the Secretary-General’s opinion that the situation does not
support a change in UNIFIL’s mandate or another reconfiguration of the Force at
this stage, and his recommendation that its mandate be extended with no changes to
the strength and composition of the Force,

1. Endorses the report of the Secretary-General on UNIFIL of 21 July 2005
(S/2005/460);

2. Decides to extend the present mandate until 31 January 2006;

3. Reiterates its strong support for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and
political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries
and under the sole and exclusive authority of the Government of Lebanon;

4. Condemns all acts of violence, including the recent incidents across the
Blue Line that have resulted in deaths and injuries on both sides, expresses great
concern about the serious breaches and the sea, land and continuing air violations of
the withdrawal line, and urges the parties to put an end to these violations, to refrain
from any act or provocation that could further escalate the tension and to abide
scrupulously by their obligation to respect the safety of the UNIFIL and other
United Nations personnel, including by avoiding any course of action which
endangers United Nations personnel;

5. Reiterates its call on the parties to continue to fulfil the commitments
they have given to respect fully the entire withdrawal line identified by the United
Nations, as set out in the Secretary-General’s report of 16 June 2000 (S/2000/590),
and to exercise utmost restraint;

6. Calls upon the Government of Lebanon to fully extend and exercise its
sole and effective authority throughout the south, including through the deployment
of sufficient numbers of Lebanese armed and security forces, to ensure a calm
environment throughout the area, including along the Blue Line, and to exert control
and monopoly over the use of force on its entire territory and to prevent attacks
from Lebanon across the Blue Line;

7. Welcomes the Secretary-General’s intention to discuss with the Lebanese
Government the next steps in preparing for an expansion of its authority in the
south;

8. Supports the continued efforts of UNIFIL to maintain the ceasefire along
the withdrawal line through mobile land and air patrols and observation from fixed
positions and through close contacts with the parties to correct violations, resolve
incidents and prevent their escalation, while stressing the primary responsibility of
the parties in this regard;

9. Welcomes the continued contribution of UNIFIL to operational mine
clearance, encourages further assistance in mine action by the United Nations to the
Government of Lebanon in support of both the continued development of its
national mine action capacity and clearance of the remaining mine/UXO threat in
the south, commends donor countries for supporting these efforts through financial
and in kind contributions and encourages further international contributions, and
stresses the necessity for provision to the Government of Lebanon and UNIFIL any
additional existing maps and minefield records;

10. Calls on the parties to ensure UNIFIL is accorded full freedom of
movement throughout its area of operation as outlined in the Secretary-General’s

S/2005/491

report, requests UNIFIL to report any obstruction it may face in the discharge of its
mandate, and reiterates its call on the parties to cooperate fully with the United
Nations and UNIFIL;

11. Welcomes the efforts being undertaken by UNIFIL to implement the
Secretary-General’s zero tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and to
ensure full compliance of its personnel with the United Nations code of conduct,
requests the Secretary-General to continue to take all necessary action in this regard
and to keep the Security Council informed, and urges troop-contributing countries to
take appropriate preventive action including the conduct of predeployment
awareness training, and to take disciplinary action and other action to ensure full
accountability in cases of such conduct involving their personnel;

12. Requests the Secretary-General to continue consultations with the
Government of Lebanon and other parties directly concerned on the implementation
of this resolution and to report thereon to the Council before the end of the present
mandate as well as on the activities of UNIFIL and the tasks presently carried out by
the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO);

13. Expresses its intention to keep the mandate and structures of UNIFIL
under regular review, taking into account the prevailing situation on the ground, the
activities actually performed by the Force in its area of operation, its contribution
towards the remaining task of restoring international peace and security, the views
of the Lebanese Government and the implications for the Force of an increased
presence of the Lebanese army in the south;

14. Looks forward to the early fulfilment of the mandate of UNIFIL;

15. Stresses the importance of, and the need to achieve, a comprehensive,
just and lasting peace in the Middle East, based on all its relevant resolutions
including its resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338 (1973) of
22 October 1973.
