Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial

  Cuba: draft resolution 
 

 

  Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial 

embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Determined to encourage strict compliance with the purposes and principles 

enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations,  

 Reaffirming, among other principles, the sovereign equality of States, 

non-intervention and non-interference in their internal affairs and freedom of 

international trade and navigation, which are also enshrined in many international 

legal instruments, 

 Recalling the statements of the Heads of State or Government of Latin America 

and the Caribbean at the Summits of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean 

States regarding the need to put an end to the economic, commercial and financial 

embargo imposed against Cuba, 

 Concerned about the continued promulgation and application by Member States 

of laws and regulations, such as that promulgated on 12 March 1996 known as “the 

Helms-Burton Act”, the extraterritorial effects of which affect the sovereignty of 

other States, the legitimate interests of entities or persons under their jurisdiction and 

the freedom of trade and navigation,  

 Taking note of declarations and resolutions of different intergovernmental 

forums, bodies and Governments that express the rejection by the international 

community and public opinion of the promulgation and application of measures of 

the kind referred to above, 

 Recalling its resolutions 47/19 of 24 November 1992, 48/16 of 3 November 

1993, 49/9 of 26 October 1994, 50/10 of 2 November 1995, 51/17 of 12 November 

1996, 52/10 of 5 November 1997, 53/4 of 14 October 1998, 54/21 of 9 November 

1999, 55/20 of 9 November 2000, 56/9 of 27 November 2001, 57/11 of 12 November 

2002, 58/7 of 4 November 2003, 59/11 of 28 October 2004, 60/12 of 8 November 

2005, 61/11 of 8 November 2006, 62/3 of 30 October 2007, 63/7 of 29 October 2008, 

64/6 of 28 October 2009, 65/6 of 26 October 2010, 66/6 of 25 October 2011, 67/4 of

18-16441 2/2 

 

13 November 2012, 68/8 of 29 October 2013, 69/5 of 28 October 2014, and 70/5 of 

27 October 2015, 71/5 of 26 October 2016 and 72/4 of 1 November 2017, 

 Recalling also the measures adopted by the Executive of the United States of 

America in 2015 and 2016 to modify several aspects of the application of the 

embargo, which contrast with the measures announced on 16 June 2017 to reinforce 

its implementation, 

 Concerned that, since the adoption of its resolutions 47/19, 48/16, 49/9, 50/10, 

51/17, 52/10, 53/4, 54/21, 55/20, 56/9, 57/11, 58/7, 59/11, 60/12, 61/11, 62/3, 63/7, 

64/6, 65/6, 66/6, 67/4, 68/8, 69/5, 70/5, 71/5 and 72/4, the economic, commercial and 

financial embargo against Cuba is still in place, and concerned also about the adverse 

effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other 

countries, 

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of 

resolution 72/4;1  

 2. Reiterates its call upon all States to refrain from promulgating and 

applying laws and measures of the kind referred to in the preamble to the present 

resolution, in conformity with their obligations under the Charter of the United 

Nations and international law, which, inter alia, reaffirm the freedom of trade and 

navigation; 

 3. Once again urges States that have and continue to apply such laws and 

measures to take the steps necessary to repeal or invalidate them as soon as possible 

in accordance with their legal regime;  

 4. Requests the Secretary-General, in consultation with the appropriate 

organs and agencies of the United Nations system, to prepare a report on the 

implementation of the present resolution in the light of the purposes and principles of 

the Charter and international law and to submit it to the General Assembly at its 

seventy-fourth session; 

 5. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-fourth session 

the item entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial 

embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba”.
