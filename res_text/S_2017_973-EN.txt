 Recalling its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace 

and security, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations,

 Recognizing that trafficking in persons in areas affected by armed conflict and 

post-conflict situations can be for the purpose of various forms of exploitation, 

including exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual 

exploitation, forced labour, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the 

removal of organs; further recognizing that trafficking in persons in armed conflict 

and post-conflict situations can also be associated with sexual violence in conflict 

and that women and children in situations of armed conflict and persons forcibly 

displaced by armed conflict, including refugees, can be especially vulnerable to 

trafficking in persons in armed conflict and to these forms of exploitation,  

 Recalling the Political Declaration on the implementation of the United 

Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, adopted by the 

General Assembly on 27 September 2017, and further welcoming the resolve of 

Member States expressed therein to take decisive concerted action to end trafficking 

in persons, wherever it may occur,  

 Reiterating deep concern that despite its condemnation of acts of trafficking in 

persons in areas affected by armed conflict, such acts continue to occur,  

 Reiterating its solidarity with victims of trafficking in persons in armed 

conflict and post-conflict situations and noting the importance of providing them 

with appropriate care, assistance and services for their physical, psychological and 

social recovery, rehabilitation and reintegration, in full respect of their huma n rights 

and in a manner that takes full account of the extreme trauma they have suffered and 

the risk of further victimization and stigmatization,  

 Reaffirming that trafficking in persons in the context of armed conflict, 

especially women and girls, cannot and should not be associated with any religion, 

nationality or civilization,  

 Recalling resolutions 2359 (2017) and 2374 (2017), which express concern 

over the serious challenges posed by different forms of transnational organized 

crime, including trafficking in persons and the smuggling of migrants in the Sahel 

region, and recalling also resolutions 2240 (2015) and 2380 (2017), which express 

concern that the situation in Libya is exacerbated by the smuggling of migrants and 

human trafficking into, through and from the Libyan territory, which could provide 

support to other organized crime and terrorist networks in Libya,  

 Reiterating the critical importance of all Member States fully implementing 

relevant Security Council resolutions, including resolutions 2195 (2014), 2253 

(2015), 2199 (2015) and 2368 (2017), which express concern that terrorists benefit 

from transnational organized crime in some regions, including from trafficking in 

persons, as well as 2242 (2015), which expresses concern that acts of sexual 

violence and gender-based violence are known to be part of the strategic objectives 

and ideology of certain terrorist groups used as a tactic of terrorism and an 

instrument to increase their finances and their power through recruitment and the 

destruction of communities; and further reiterating the connection between 

trafficking in persons, sexual violence and terrorism and other organized criminal 

activities, which can prolong and exacerbate conflict and instability or intensify its 

impact on civilian populations,  

 Recognizing the need to continue to foster a global partnership against 

trafficking in persons among all stakeholders, including inter alia, through bilateral, 

multilateral and regional processes and initiatives,  

 Recognizing that trafficking in persons entails the violation or abuse of human 

rights and underscoring that certain acts or offences associated with trafficking in 

persons in the context of armed conflict may constitute war crimes; and recalling 

further the responsibilities of States to end impunity and to prosecute those

responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes as well as other 

crimes and the need for States to adopt appropriate measures within their national 

legal systems for those crimes for which they are required under international law to 

exercise their responsibility to investigate and prosecute,  

 Condemning in the strongest terms continued gross, systematic and 

widespread abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law 

by ISIL (also known as Da’esh); and abductions of women and children by ISIL, 

ANF, and associated individuals, groups, undertakings, and entities and expressing 

outrage at their exploitation and abuse, including rape and sexual violence, forced 

marriage and enslavement by these entities, encouraging all State and non-state 

actors with evidence to bring it to the attention of the Council, along with any 

information that human trafficking and related forms of exploitation and abuse may 

support the perpetrators financially, emphasizing that States are required to ensure 

that their nationals and persons within their territory do not make available any 

funds, financial assets or economic resources for ISIL’s benefit, and noting that any 

person or entity who transfers funds to ISIL directly or indirectly in connection with 

such exploitation and abuse would be eligible for listing by the Security Council 

Committee established pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011), 2253 

(2015) and 2368 (2017) concerning ISIL (Da’esh), Al-Qaida and associated 

individuals, groups, undertakings and entities,  

 Recognizing that persons affected by armed conflict and fleeing conflict are at 

great risk of being subjected to trafficking in persons, and stressing the need to 

prevent and identify instances of trafficking in persons among those forcibly 

displaced or otherwise affected by armed conflict,  

 Expressing grave concern over the high numbers of women and children 

subjected to trafficking in armed conflicts, and recognizing that acts of trafficking in 

persons are often associated with other violations of applicable international law 

and other abuses, including those involving recruitment and use, abduction and 

sexual violence including, inter alia, rape, sexual slavery, forced prostitu tion and 

forced pregnancy; and calling on all Member States to hold perpetrators accountable 

and to assist victims in their recovery and reintegration,  

 Reiterating its grave concern over the abduction of children in situations of 

armed conflict, the majority of which are perpetrated by non-State armed groups, 

recognizing that abductions occur in a variety of settings, including schools, further 

recognizing that abduction often precedes or follows other abuses and violations of 

applicable international law against children, including those involving recruitment 

and use, killing and maiming, as well as rape and other forms of sexual violence, 

which may amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity, and calling on all 

Member States to hold perpetrators of abductions accountable,  

 Expressing deep concern over the heightened vulnerability to exploitation and 

abuse of children forcibly displaced by armed conflict, particularly when separated 

from their families or caregivers, and underlining the need to ensure protection of 

all unaccompanied children who are victims of or those vulnerable to trafficking in 

persons through their prompt identification and immediate assistance taking into 

account their specific needs,  

 Condemning all violations and abuses against children in armed conflict, 

including trafficking in persons and recalling all its resolutions on children and 

armed conflict that call for the protection of children, and in particular Resolution 

1261 (1999) as well as Resolution 1612 (2005), establishing the Monitoring and 

Reporting Mechanism on children and armed conflict,
