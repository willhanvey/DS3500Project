The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolution 33/91 H of 16 December 1978 in which it requested
the Committee on Disarmament, at an appropriate stage of its implementation of the
proposal set forth in the Programrle of Action contained in the Final Document of
the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly, 61 to consider ureently the
Question of adequately verified cessation and prohibition of the production of
fissionable lnaterial for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices and
to keep the {Genera!! Assembly informed of the progress of that c0nsideration,

Notin~ that the agenda adopted by the Cormnittee on Disarmament includes the
item entitled "Nuclear weapons in all aspects" and that the agenda for 1979

facilitatins the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and explosive
devices ~

Requests the Committee on Disarmament, at an appropriate stage of its work on
the item entitled "Nuclear weapons in all aspects", to pursue its consioeration of
