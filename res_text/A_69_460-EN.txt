  Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of 

Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized

 The General Assembly, 

 Having considered the item entitled “Implementation of the Declaration on the 

Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized 

agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations”,  

 Having also considered the report of the Secretary-General1 and the report of 

the Economic and Social Council2 on the item, 

 Having examined the chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the 

Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of 

Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for 2014 relating to the item, 3 

 Recalling its resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 and 1541 (XV) of 

15 December 1960 and the resolutions of the Special Committee, as well as other 

relevant resolutions and decisions, including in particular Economic and Social

 Bearing in mind the relevant provisions of the final documents of the 

successive Conferences of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries 

and of the resolutions adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government 

of the African Union, the Pacific Islands Forum and the Caribbean Community,  

 Conscious of the need to facilitate the implementation of the Declaration on 

the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in 

resolution 1514 (XV), 

 Noting that the large majority of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories 

are small island Territories, 

 Welcoming the assistance extended to Non-Self-Governing Territories by 

certain specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, 

in particular the United Nations Development Programme,  

 Welcoming also the participation in the capacity of observers of those  

Non-Self-Governing Territories that are associate members of regional commissions

Assembly and the Special Committee on specific Territories,  

 Noting that only some specialized agencies and other organizations of the 

United Nations system have been involved in providing assistance to Non-Self-

Governing Territories, 

 Stressing that, because the development options of the small island Non-Self-

Governing Territories are limited, there are special challenges to planning for and 

implementing sustainable development and that those Territories will be constrained 

in meeting the challenges without the continuing cooperation and assistance of the 

specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system,  

 Stressing also the importance of securing the resources necessary for funding 

expanded programmes of assistance for the peoples concerned and the need to enlist 

the support of all major funding institutions within the United Nations system in 

that regard, 

 Reaffirming the mandates of the specialized agencies and other organizations 

of the United Nations system to take all appropriate measures, within their 

respective spheres of competence, to ensure the full implementation of General 

Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant resolutions,  

 Expressing its appreciation to the African Union, the Pacific Islands Forum, 

the Caribbean Community and other regional organizations for the continued 

cooperation and assistance that they have extended to the specialized agencies and 

other organizations of the United Nations system in this regard, 

 Expressing its conviction that closer contacts and consultations between and 

among the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations 

system and regional organizations help to facilitate the effective formulation of 

programmes of assistance to the peoples concerned,  

 Mindful of the imperative need to keep under continuous review the activities 

of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system in 

the implementation of the various resolutions and decisions of the United Nations 

relating to decolonization, 

 Bearing in mind the extremely fragile economies of the small island Non-Self-

Governing Territories and their vulnerability to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, 

cyclones and sea-level rise, and recalling the relevant resolutions of the General 

Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 68/89 of 11 December 2013 on the implementation of 

the Declaration by the specialized agencies and the international institutions 

associated with the United Nations, 

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General; 

 2. Recommends that all States intensify their efforts in the specialized 

agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system in which they are 

members to ensure the full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the

Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), and other relevant resolutions of the United 

Nations;

those peoples; 

 5. Expresses its appreciation to those specialized agencies and other 

organizations of the United Nations system that have continued to cooperate with 

the United Nations and the regional and subregional organizations in the

including possible participation at the regional seminars on decolonization, upon the 

invitation of the Special Committee;

of the United Nations system and regional organizations to strengthen existing

mandates, in order to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors o f those 

Territories; 

 10. Requests the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United

 (d) Illegal exploitation of the marine and other natural resources of the

A/69/460 
 

 

14-62784 6/7
