Reaffirming once more the applicability of the Geneva Convention relative to
the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, ~I to the
Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem, and the other
occupied Arab territories,

Noting that Israel's record, policies and actions establish conclusively that
it is not a peace-loving Member State and that it has not carried out its
obligations under the Charter of the United Nations,

Noting also that Israel has refused,. in violation of Article 25 of the
Charter, to accept and carry out the numerous relevant decisions of the Security
Council, in particular resolution 497 (1981), thus failing to carry out its
obligations under the Charter,

1. Strongly condemns Israel for its failure to comply with Security Council
resolution 497 (1981) and General Assembly resolutions 36/226 B, ES-9/1, 37/123 A,
38/180 A, 39/146 B, 40/168B, 41/162 B, 421209 C and 43/54 B;

2. Declares once more that Israel's continued occupation of the Syrian Arab
Golan and its decision of 14 December 1981 to impose its' laws, jurisdiction and
administration on the occupied Syrian Arab Golan constitute an act of aggression
under the provisions of Article 39 of the .Charter of the United Nations and General
Assembly resolution 3314 (XXIX);

3. Declares once more that Israel's decision to impose its laws,
jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Arab Golan is illegal and
therefore null and void and has no validity whatsoever;

4. Declares all Y.sraeli policies and practices of, or aimed at, annexation
of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem, and of the
other occupied Arab territories, to be illegal and in violation of international
law and of the relevant United Nations resolutions;

5. Determines once more that all actions taken by Israel to give effect to
its decision relating to the occupied Syrian Arab Golan are illegal and invalid and
shall not be recognized;

6. Reaffirms its determination that all relevant provisions of the
Regulations annexed to the Hague Convention IV of 1907, 3/ and the Geneva
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of
12 August 1949, continue to apply to the Syrian territory occupied by Israel since
1967, and calls upon the parties thereto to respect and ensure respect for their
obligations under these instruments in all circumstances;
