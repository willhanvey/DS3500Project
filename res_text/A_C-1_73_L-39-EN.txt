  Implementation of the Convention on Cluster Munitions 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolutions 63/71 of 2 December 2008 on the Convention on 

Cluster Munitions and 70/54 of 7 December 2015, 71/45 of 5 December 2016 and 

72/54 of 4 December 2017 on the implementation of the Convention,  

 Reaffirming its determination to put an end for all time to the suffering and 

casualties caused by cluster munitions at the time of their use, when they fail to 

function as intended or when they are abandoned,  

 Deploring the recent cases of cluster munitions use and related civilian 

casualties, and calling upon those who continue to use cluster munitions to cease any 

such activity immediately,  

 Conscious that cluster munition remnants kill or maim civilians, including 

women and children, obstruct economic and social development, including through 

the loss of livelihood, impede post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction, delay or 

prevent the return of refugees and internally displaced persons, can have a negative 

impact on national and international peacebuilding and humanitarian assistance 

efforts, and have other severe consequences for many years after use,  

 Concerned about the dangers presented by the large national stockpiles of 

cluster munitions retained for operational use, and determined to ensure their rapid 

destruction, 

 Recognizing the impact of cluster munitions on women, men, girls and boys and 

the importance of relevant States providing adequate, gender- and age-sensitive 

assistance to victims of cluster munitions,

 Believing it necessary to contribute effectively in an efficient, coordinated 

manner to resolving the challenge of removing cluster munition remnants located 

throughout the world, and to ensure their destruction,  

 Mindful of the need to coordinate adequately efforts undertaken in various 

forums, including through the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,1 

to address the rights and needs of victims of various types of weapons, and resolved 

to avoid discrimination among victims of various types of weapons,  

 Reaffirming that in cases not covered by the Convention on Cluster Munitions2 

or by other international agreements, civilians and combatants remain under the 

protection and authority of the principles of international law, derived from 

established custom, from the principles of humanity and from the dictates of public 

conscience,  

 Welcoming the steps taken nationally, regionally and globally in recent years 

aimed at prohibiting, restricting or suspending the use, stockpiling, production and 

transfer of cluster munitions, and welcoming in this regard that, since 2014, all 

Central American States have joined the Convention, thus fulfilling their aspiration 

to become the first cluster munitions-free region in the world,  

 Stressing the role of public conscience in furthering the principles of humanity, 

as evidenced by the global call for an end to civilian suffering caused by cluster 

munitions, and recognizing the efforts to that end undertaken by the United Nations, 

the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Cluster Munition Coalition and 

numerous other non-governmental organizations around the world,  

 Noting that a total of 120 States have joined the Convention, 104 as States 

parties and 16 as signatories,  

 Recalling that 2018 marks the tenth anniversary of the Convention, and 

emphasizing the need to make further efforts in accelerating the universalization 

process,  

 Taking note of the initiative of the Secretary-General’s initiative Securing Our 

Common Future: An Agenda for Disarmament, in particular the section entitled 

“Disarmament that saves lives”,  

 Taking note also of the 2015 Dubrovnik Declaration3 and the Dubrovnik Action 

Plan4 adopted at the First Review Conference of States Parties to the Convention on 

Cluster Munitions, held in Dubrovnik, Croatia, from 7 to 11 September 2015,  

 Taking note further of the political declaration establishing 2030 as a target date 

to implement all individual and collective outstanding obligations under the 

Convention as adopted by consensus under the presidency of the Netherlands at the 

Sixth Meeting of States Parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions, held in 

Geneva from 5 to 7 September 2016,  

 Welcoming the dialogue undertaken by the German presidency of the Seventh 

Meeting of States Parties with States not parties to the Convention, including the 

military-to-military dialogue, in support of universal adherence to the Convention, 

and recognizing the assistance that the country coalition concept can provide to 

affected countries in the implementation of their obligations under the Convention,

 1. Urges all States outside the Convention on Cluster Munitions2 to join as

destruction of cluster munition remnants and related activities more effective;  

 6. Reiterates the invitation to States not parties to participate in a continued 

dialogue on issues relevant to the Convention in order to enhance its humanitarian

munitions;

States, the United Nations, other relevant international organizations or institutions,

in the future meetings of States parties to the Convention;

from outstanding dues, including options to ensure sustainable financing for the 

meetings and prompt payment of respective shares of the estimated costs;  

 9. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-fourth session, 

under the item entitled “General and complete disarmament”, a sub-item entitled 

“Implementation of the Convention on Cluster Munitions”.
