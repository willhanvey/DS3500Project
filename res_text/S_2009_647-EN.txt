 Reaffirming that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of 
the most serious threats to peace and security and that any acts of terrorism are 
criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivations, whenever and by 
whomsoever committed, and reiterating its unequivocal condemnation of Al-Qaida, 
Usama bin Laden, the Taliban and other individuals, groups, undertakings and 
entities associated with them, for ongoing and multiple criminal terrorist acts aimed 
at causing the deaths of innocent civilians and other victims, destruction of property 
and greatly undermining stability, 

 Reaffirming the need to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter 
of the United Nations and international law, including applicable international 
human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, threats to international peace and 
security caused by terrorist acts, stressing in this regard the important role the 
United Nations plays in leading and coordinating this effort,

taking by individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, 
Usama bin Laden or the Taliban with the aim of raising funds, or gaining political 
concessions, 

 Reiterating its support for the fight against illicit production and trafficking of 
drugs from, and chemical precursors to Afghanistan, in neighbouring countries, 
countries on trafficking routes, drug destination countries and precursors producing 
countries,

approach involving the active participation and collaboration of all States, and 
international and regional organizations to impede, impair, isolate and incapacitate 
the terrorist threat,

security, and stressing in this regard the need for robust implementation of the 
measures in paragraph 1 of this resolution as a significant tool in combating terrorist 
activity,

improvements to the Committee’s procedures and the quality of the Consolidated 
List, and expressing its intent to continue efforts to ensure that procedures are fair 
and clear,  

 Reiterating that the measures referred to in paragraph 1 of this resolution are 
preventative in nature and are not reliant upon criminal standards set out under 
national law,
