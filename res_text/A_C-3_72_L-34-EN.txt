 Reaffirming the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United

peoples, the non-use of force or of the threat of use of force in international

 Acknowledging with appreciation the work and contributions of the open-

ended intergovernmental working group established by the Human Rights Council 

with the mandate of considering the possibility of elaborating an international 

regulatory framework, including the option of elaborating a legally binding 

instrument on the regulation, monitoring and oversight of the activities of private 

military and security companies,  

 Alarmed and concerned at the danger that the activities of mercenaries 

constitute to peace and security in developing countries in various parts of the 

world, in particular in areas of armed conflict, and about the threat they pose to the 

integrity of and respect for the constitutional order of the affected countries,  

 Deeply concerned at the loss of life, the substantial damage to property and the 

negative effects on the policies and economies of affected countries resulting from 

international criminal mercenary activities,  

 Convinced that, notwithstanding the way in which mercenaries or mercenary -

related activities are used or the form that they take to acquire some semblance of 

legitimacy, they are a threat to peace, security and the self -determination of peoples 

and an obstacle to the enjoyment of all human rights by peoples,

the Human Rights Council on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human

violate the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations;

operations by third Powers encourage, inter alia, the demand for mercenaries on the 

global market; 

 4. Urges, once again, all States to take the steps necessary and to exercise 

the utmost vigilance against the menace posed by the activities of mercenaries and

 16. Also requests the Working Group on the use of mercenaries to continue
