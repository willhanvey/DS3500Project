solidarity with the victims of terrorism and their families, and stressing the 

importance of assisting victims of terrorism and providing them and their families 

with support to cope with their loss and grief,  

 Gravely concerned that in some cases terrorists or terrorist groups, in 

particular ISIL, Al-Qaida, and associated individuals, groups, undertakings, and 

entities continue to profit from involvement in transnational organized crime, and 

expressing concern that terrorists benefit from transnational organized crime in 

some regions, including from the trafficking of arms, persons, drugs, and artifacts, 

and from the illicit trade in natural resources including gold and other precious 

metals and stones, minerals, wildlife, charcoal and oil, as well as from kidnapping 

for ransom and other crimes including extortion and bank robbery,  

 Expressing concern at the continuing use, in a globalized society, by terrorists 

and their supporters, of information and communications technologies,  in particular 

the Internet, to facilitate terrorist acts, and condemning their use to incite, recruit, 

fund, or plan terrorist acts,  

 Expressing concern also at the continued flow of international recruits to ISIL, 

Al-Qaida, and associated groups, and recalling its resolution 2178 (2014) deciding 

that Member States shall, consistent with international human rights law, 

international refugee law, and international humanitarian law, prevent and suppress

the financing of their travel and of their activities,  

 Particularly concerned at the growing involvement of terrorist groups, 

especially in areas of conflict, in the destruction and the trafficking in cultural 

property and related offences, and recognizing the indispensable role of 

international cooperation in crime prevention and criminal justice responses to 

combat such trafficking and related offences in a comprehensive and effective 

manner, 

 Reiterating the obligation of Member States to prevent the movement of 

terrorists and terrorist groups, in accordance with applicable international law, by, 

inter alia, effective border controls, and, in this context, to exchange information 

expeditiously, improve cooperation among competent authorities to prevent the 

movement of terrorists and terrorist groups to and from their territories, the supply 

of weapons for terrorists, and financing that would support terrorists,  

 Stressing that terrorism can only be defeated by a sustained and 

comprehensive approach involving the active participation and collaboration of all 

States and international and regional organizations to impede, impair, isolate, and 

incapacitate the terrorist threat, 

 Underlining the importance of strengthening international cooperation, 

including by investigators, prosecutors and judges, in order to prevent, investigate 

and prosecute terrorist acts, and recognizing the persisting challenges associated 

with strengthening international cooperation in combating terrorism including in 

stemming the flow of FTFs to and returning from conflict zones, in particular due to 

the cross border nature of the activity,

through relevant authorities including judicial authorities and channels, including 

law enforcement, intelligence, security services, and financial intelligence unit s, and 

also calling upon Member States to improve integration and utilization of financial 

intelligence with other types of information available, such as that provided by the 

private sector to national governments, to more effectively counter the terroris t 

financing threats posed by ISIL, Al-Qaida, and associated individuals, groups, 

undertakings and entities, including through actions related to investigative 

techniques, evidence gathering and prosecution,  

 Calling upon Member States to continue information-sharing, through 

appropriate channels and arrangements, and consistent with international and

particular their supply of weapons and sources of material support, and on the  

ongoing international counter-terrorism cooperation including among special 

services, security agencies and law enforcement organizations and criminal justice 

authorities,
