The Security Council,

Reaffirming all its previous resolutions and statements pertaining to the
situation between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and the requirements contained therein,
including in particular resolutions 1622 (2005) of 13 September 2005 and 1640
(2005) of 23 November 2005, as well as the statement of its President of
24 February 2006 (S/PRST/2006/10),

Stressing its unwavering commitment to the peace process, and to the full and
expeditious implementation of the Algiers Agreements,

Stressing further that lasting peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea (hereinafter

full demarcation of the border between the two parties, and recalling that both
parties have agreed to accept the delimitation and demarcation decisions of the
Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC) as final and binding,

Reaffirming its strong commitment to ensure that the two parties permit the
United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) to perform its duties
without restrictions and provide UNMEE with the necessary access, assistance,
support and protection required for the performance of these duties, and in this
regard stressing that demarcation of the border cannot proceed effectively unless
UNMEE is allowed full freedom of movement throughout its area of operations,

Welcoming the successful convening of the meeting of the Witnesses to the
Algiers Agreements on 22 February 2006 in New York, as well as the convening of
the EEBC meeting on 10 March 2006 in London,

Bearing in mind the reports of the Secretary-General of 3 January 2006
(S/2006/1) and of 6 March 2006 (S/2006/140) and the options on the future of
UNMEE contained therein,

Decides to extend the mandate of UNMEE for a period of one month until
15 April 2006;

Demands that the two parties fully comply with resolution 1640 (2005), in
particular paragraphs 1 and 5;

Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
