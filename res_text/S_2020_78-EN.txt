 The Security Council,  

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 14 November 2019 on his 

Good Offices (S/2019/883) and of 7 January 2020 on the United Nations operation in 

Cyprus (S/2020/23), and expressing its full support for his Good Offices to remain 

available to assist the sides, should they jointly decide to re-engage in negotiations 

with the necessary political will,  

 Underscoring that the responsibility for finding a solution lies first and foremost 

with the Cypriots themselves, and reaffirming the primary role of the United Nations 

in assisting the parties to bring the Cyprus conflict and division of the island to a 

comprehensive and durable settlement with a sense of urgency,  

 Urging the sides to renew their efforts to achieve an enduring, comprehensive 

and just settlement based on a bicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality, 

as set out in relevant Security Council resolutions, including paragraph 4 of its 

resolution 716 (1991), and stressing that the status quo is unsustainable,  

 Expressing deep concern at the further escalation and increased tensions in the 

eastern Mediterranean over hydrocarbons exploration, convinced of the many 

important benefits, including economic benefits, for all Cypriots that would flow from 

a comprehensive and durable settlement, and reiterating the Secretary-General’s call 

for serious efforts to avoid any further escalation and to defuse tensions, 

 Recalling its resolution 1325 (2000) and related resolutions, recognising that 

the full, equal and meaningful participation and leadership of women is essential in 

building peace in Cyprus and will contribute to making any future settlement 

sustainable, welcoming efforts to bring together a broader range of women actors on 

both sides, encouraging the sides to ensure the unique concerns of women are 

addressed in a future settlement, and looking forward to the outcome of the gender-

sensitive socio-economic impact assessment requested in its resolution 2453 (2019),  

 Recalling its resolution 2250 (2015) that recognises the important and positive 

contribution of youth in efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and 

security, and as a key aspect of the sustainability, inclusiveness and success of 

peacekeeping and peace building efforts, and further encourages the full, effective 

and meaningful participation of youth in this process,  

 Recognising that effective contact and communication between the sides 

enhances the prospects for settlement and is in the interests of  all Cypriots, and helps 

to address island-wide matters, including environmental protection and crime,
