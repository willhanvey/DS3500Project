 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions, in particular resolutions 2364 (2017) and 

2359 (2017), concerning the situation in Mali,  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, unity and territorial 

integrity of Mali, emphasizing that the Malian authorities have primary 

responsibility for the provision of stability and security throughout the territory of 

Mali, and underscoring the importance of achieving national ownership of peace- 

and security-related initiatives, 

 Recognizing the legitimate aspiration of all Malian citizens to enjoy lasting 

peace and development, 

 Recognizing that the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali (“the 

Agreement”) signed in 2015 by the Government of Mali, the Plateforme coalition of 

armed groups, and the Coordination des Mouvements de l’Azawad  coalition of 

armed groups, and its continued implementation, represents a historic opportunity to 

achieve lasting peace in Mali, 

 Condemning the repeated violations of the ceasefire arrangements by the 

Plateforme and Coordination armed groups in the Kidal and Menaka regions, urging 

them to cease hostilities, to strictly adhere to the ceasefire arrangements and to 

resume a constructive dialogue without delay for the full implementation of the  

Agreement, and welcoming to this extent the recent signing of a truce agreement on 

23 August 2017 in Bamako, 

 Recognizing the recent progress achieved for the implementation of the 

Agreement, including the establishment of all interim administrations in t he North, 

while expressing its deep concern over the persistent delays for its full 

implementation two years after it was concluded, and highlighting the pressing need 

to deliver tangible and visible peace dividends to the population in the North and 

other parts of Mali in order to keep the momentum of the Agreement,  

 Affirming its intention to facilitate, support and follow closely the 

implementation of the Agreement, commending the role played by Algeria and other 

members of the international mediation team to assist the Malian parties to 

implement the Agreement, emphasizing the need for increased engagement by the 

members of the international mediation team, and further emphasizing the central 

role the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Mali should continue to 

play to support and oversee the implementation of the Agreement,

 Deploring that the slow progress in the implementation of the Agreement, 

particularly its defence and security provisions, as well as the delayed restructuring 

of the security sector, have hampered efforts to restore security and the authority of 

the Malian State and the delivery of basic social services in the North of Mali, and 

stressing the primary responsibility of the Government of Mali, the Plateforme and 

Coordination armed groups to accelerate the implementation of the Agreement in 

order to improve the security situation across Mali and to forestall attempts by 

terrorist groups to derail the implementation of the Agreement,  

 Expressing its serious concern about the volatile security situation, especially 

the expansion of terrorist and other criminal activities into Central and Southern 

Mali as well as the intensification of criminal activities such as drug trafficking and 

trafficking in persons in Mali,

transnational organized crime in the Sahel region, including arms, drug and cultural 

property trafficking, the smuggling of migrants, trafficking in persons, and its 

increasing links, in some cases, with terrorism, and underscoring the responsibility 

of the countries in the region in addressing these threats and challenges,  

 Noting that impunity can encourage a culture of corruption in which 

trafficking and other criminal interests can thrive, further encouraging instability 

and insecurity, and calling for the Malian government to devote appropriate law 

enforcement resources in this regard and encouraging international, regional and 

sub-regional cooperation and support to the Malian Government in this endeavour, 

 Strongly condemning the activities in Mali and in the Sahel region of terrorist 

organizations, including the Mouvement pour l’unicité et le jihad en Afrique de

al Islam wal-Muslimin (Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims), Islamic State 

in Greater Sahara and Ansaroul Islam, which continue to operate in Mali and 

constitute a threat to peace and security in the region and beyond , as well as human

Maghreb, Ansar Eddine and its leader Iyad Ag Ghali, and Al-Mourabitoun on the 

ISIL (Da’esh) and Al-Qaida sanctions list established pursuant to resolutions 1267

the established listing criteria,  

 Strongly condemning the continuing attacks, including terrorist attacks against
