Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East,
covering the period from 1 July 1991 to 30 June 1992, ],/

1. Notes with deep regret that repatriation or compensation of the
refugees as provided for in paragraph 11 of General A.ssembly resol ution
194 (III) has not been effected, that no substantial progress has been made in
the programme endorsed by the Assembly in paragraph 2 of its resolution
513 (VI) of 26 January 1952 for the reintegration of refugees either by
repatriation or resettlement and that, therefore, the situation of. the
refugees continues to be a matter of serious concern;

2. Expresses its thanks to the Commissioner-General and to all the
staff of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in
the Near East, recognizing that the Agency is doing all it can within the
limits of available resources, and also expresses its thanks to the
specialized agencies and private organizations for their valuable work in
assisting the refugees;

3. Reiterates its request that the headquarters of the Agency should be
relocated to its former si te within its area of operations as soon as
practicable;

4. Notes with re~ that the United Nations Conciliation Commis sion
for Palestine has been unable to find a means of achieving progres 5 in the
implementation of paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution ~94 (III) I 1/
and requests the Commission to exert continued efforts towards the
implementation of that paragraph and to report to the Assembly as appropriate,
but no later than 1 September 1993; .

5. Directs attention to the continuing seriousness of the financial
posi tion of the Agency, as outlined in the report of the Cammi ssioner-General;

6. Notes with profound concern that .. despite the commendable and
successful efforts of the Commissioner-General to collect addi tiona1
contributions, this increased level of income to the Agency is sti~l
insufficient to cover essential budget requirements in the pre sent year and
that, at currently foreseen levels of giving, deficits will recur each year;

7. Calls upon all Governments, as a matter of urgency, to make the mos t
generous efforts possible to meet the anticipated needs of the Agency,
particularly in the light of the budgetary deficit projected in the report of
the Commissioner-General, and therefore urges non-contributing Governments to
