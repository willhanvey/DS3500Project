  Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Reiterating that the cessation of nuclear-weapon test explosions or any other 

nuclear explosions constitutes an effective nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation 

measure, and convinced that this is a meaningful step in the realization of a systematic 

process for achieving nuclear disarmament,  

 Recalling that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, adopted by the 

General Assembly by its resolution 50/245 of 10 September 1996, was opened for 

signature on 24 September 1996,  

 Stressing that a universal and effectively verifiable Treaty constitutes a 

fundamental instrument in the field of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and 

will be a major contribution to international peace and security,  

 Stressing also the vital importance and urgency of achieving the entry into force 

of the Treaty, as noted also in Security Council resolution 2310 (2016) of 

23 September 2016, and affirming its resolute determination, 22 years after the Treaty 

was opened for signature, to achieve its entry into force,  

 Encouraged by the signing of the Treaty by 184 States, including 41 of the 44 

whose ratification is needed for its entry into force, and welcoming the ratification of

the Treaty by 167 States, including 36 of the 44 whose ratification is needed for its 

entry into force, among which there are 3 nuclear-weapon States,  

 Recalling its resolution 72/70 of 4 December 2017,  

 Recalling also the adoption by consensus of the conclusions and 

recommendations for follow-on actions of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties 

to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,1 in which the Conference, 

inter alia, reaffirmed the vital importance of the entry into force of the Comprehensive 

Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as a core element of the international nuclear disarmament 

and non-proliferation regime and included specific actions to be taken in support of 

the entry into force of the Treaty,  

 Welcoming the Final Declaration adopted by the tenth Conference on 

Facilitating the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, held 

in New York on 20 September 2017, convened pursuant to article XIV of the Treaty, 

and recalling the Joint Ministerial Statement on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban 

Treaty, adopted at the ministerial meeting held in New York on 27 September 2018,  

 Noting the conference of the CTBTO Youth Group , held in Moscow from 18 to 

20 October 2017, and the “intergenerational dialogue”, held in Astana from 28 August 

to 2 September 2018, which brought together members of the group of eminent 

persons established to support the article XIV process and members of the Youth 

Group to build and sustain momentum for the universalization and entry into force of 

the Treaty, 

 Welcoming continuing progress in the development of the Treaty’s verification 

regime, which advances the Treaty’s primary non-proliferation and disarmament 

objective, and the establishment of over 91 per cent of the stations planned for the 

International Monitoring System network,  

 Recognizing the civil and scientific benefits provided by the Treaty’s global 

monitoring system,  

 1. Stresses the vital importance and urgency of signature and ratification, 

without delay and without conditions, in order to achieve the earliest entry into force 

of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty;2  

 2. Welcomes the contributions by the signatory States to the work of the 

Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty 

Organization, in particular its efforts to ensure that the verification regime of the 

Treaty will be capable of meeting the verification requirements o f the Treaty upon its 

entry into force, in accordance with article IV of the Treaty, and encourages their 

continuation; 

 3. Underlines the need to maintain momentum towards the completion of all 

elements of the verification regime;  

 4. Urges all States not to carry out nuclear-weapon test explosions or any 

other nuclear explosions, to maintain their moratoriums in this regard and to refrain 

from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of the Treaty, while stressing that 

these measures do not have the same permanent and legally binding effect as the entry 

into force of the Treaty;  

 5. Condemns in the strongest terms the six nuclear tests conducted by the 

Democratic People’s Republic of Korea since 2006 in violation of relevant Security

Council resolutions, 3  urges full compliance with the obligations under those 

resolutions, including that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea abandon its 

nuclear weapons programme and not conduct any further nuclear tests, notes with 

encouragement the statement of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea 

concerning a moratorium on nuclear tests and efforts towards the dismantlement of 

the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, reaffirms its support for the complete, verifiable and 

irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner, including 

through the Six-Party Talks, and welcomes all efforts and dialogue to this end, 

including the recent inter-Korean summits and the summit between the United States 

of America and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea;  

 6. Urges all States that have not yet signed or ratified, or that have signed but 

not yet ratified, the Treaty, in particular those whose ratification is needed for its entry 

into force, to sign and ratify it as soon as possible and to accelerate their ratification 

processes with a view to ensuring their earliest successful conclusion;  

 7. Welcomes, since the adoption of its previous resolution on the subject, the 

ratification of the Treaty by Thailand and the signature of the Treaty by Tuvalu, since 

each ratification or signature is a significant step towards the entry into force of the 

Treaty;  

 8. Encourages further expressions from among the remaining States whose 

ratification is needed for the Treaty to enter into force of their intention to pursue and 

complete the ratification process;

and, where in a position to do so, to promote adherence to the Treaty through bilateral 

and joint outreach, seminars and other means;  

 10. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-fourth session 

the item entitled “Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty”.
