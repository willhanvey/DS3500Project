the Treaty,4 

 Recognizing that the enhancement of international peace and security and the 
promotion of nuclear disarmament are mutually reinforcing,  

 Reaffirming that further advancement in nuclear disarmament will contribute 
to consolidating the international regime for nuclear non-proliferation, which is, 
inter alia, essential to international peace and security, 

 Taking note of concrete proposals and initiatives on nuclear disarmament, 
including those put forward or undertaken by nuclear-weapon States, including 
recently by France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 

 Expressing deep concern regarding the growing dangers posed by the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, inter alia, nuclear weapons, including 
that caused by proliferation networks, 

 Recognizing the importance of implementing Security Council resolution 1718 
(2006) of 14 October 2006 with regard to the nuclear test proclaimed by the 
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on 9 October 2006, while taking note of the

in order to facilitate the successful outcome of the 2010 Review Conference of the 
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; 

 3. Reaffirms the importance of the universality of the Treaty, and calls upon 
States not parties to the Treaty to accede to it as non-nuclear-weapon States without 
delay and without conditions, and pending their accession to refrain from acts that 
would defeat the objective and purpose of the Treaty as well as to take practical 
steps in support of the Treaty; 

 4. Encourages further steps leading to nuclear disarmament, to which all 
States parties to the Treaty are committed under article VI of the Treaty, including 
deeper reductions in all types of nuclear weapons, and emphasizes the importance of 
applying irreversibility and verifiability, as well as increased transparency in a way 
that promotes international stability and undiminished security for all, in the process 
of working towards the elimination of nuclear weapons;
