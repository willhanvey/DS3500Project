of 4 June 1997, 1129 (1997) of 12 September 1997, 1143 (1997) of 4 December

amount of revenue available for the purchase of humanitarian supplies, laid down
new provisions and procedures designed to improve the implementation of the
humanitarian programme and to further achievements in meeting the humanitarian
needs of the Iraqi population and reiterated the obligation of Iraq to facilitate the

Taking note of the concluding observations of the Human Rights Committee,5
the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination,6 the Committee on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,7 the Committee on the Rights of the Child8
and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women9 on the
recent reports submitted to them by Iraq, in which these treaty monitoring bodies
point to a wide range of human rights problems and express the view that the
Government of Iraq remains bound by its treaty obligations, while pointing to the
adverse effect of sanctions on the daily life of the population, in particular women
and children,

Reaffirming that it is the responsibility of the Government of Iraq to ensure the
well-being of its entire population and the full enjoyment of all human rights and
fundamental freedoms, concerned about the dire situation in Iraq, which affects the
population, in particular children, as stated in the reports of several United Nations
human rights treaty bodies, and appealing to all concerned to fulfil their mutual
obligations in the management of the humanitarian programme established by the
Security Council in its resolution 986 (1995),

cooperate with the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances for
that purpose, to cooperate with the high-level coordinator of the Secretary-General
