 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming its resolutions 1261 (1999) of 25 August 1999, 1314 (2000) of 
11 August 2000, 1379 (2001) of 20 November 2001, 1460 (2003) of 30 January 
2003, 1539 (2004) of 22 April 2004, 1612 (2005) of 26 July 2005, 1882 (2009) of 
4 August 2009 and 1998 (2011) of 12 July 2011, and all relevant Statements of its 
President, which contribute to a comprehensive framework for addressing the 
protection of children affected by armed conflict, 

 Reiterating its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace 
and security and, in this connection, its commitment to address the widespread impact 
of armed conflict on children, 

 Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 26 April 2012 
(A/66/782-S/2012/261) and stressing that the present resolution does not seek to 
make any legal determination as to whether situations which are referred to in the 
Secretary-General’s report are or are not armed conflicts within the context of the 
Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocols thereto, nor does it prejudge the 
legal status of the non-State parties involved in these situations, 

 Stressing the primary role of Governments in providing protection and relief to 
all children affected by armed conflict, and reiterating that all actions undertaken by 
United Nations entities within the framework of the monitoring and reporting 
mechanism must be designed to support and supplement, as appropriate, the 
protection and rehabilitation roles of national Governments, 

 Stressing the importance of comprehensively protecting children in all 
situations of armed conflict, 

 Acknowledging that the implementation of its resolutions 1612 (2005), 1882 
(2009) and 1998 (2011) has generated progress, in particular the demobilization of 
thousands of children, the signing of action plans between parties to armed conflict 
and the United Nations and the delisting of parties to conflict from the annexes to 
the Secretary-General’s annual report, 



S/2012/713  
 

12-51547 2 
 

 Remaining deeply concerned over the lack of progress on the ground in some 
situations of armed conflict, where parties to conflict continue to violate with 
impunity the relevant provisions of applicable international law relating to the rights 
and protection of children in armed conflict, 

 Recognizing the importance of strengthening national capacities for the 
protection, reintegration and rehabilitation of children affected by armed conflict, 
bearing in mind national ownership, 

 Recalling the responsibilities of States to end impunity and to prosecute those 
responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other egregious 
crimes perpetrated against children, 

 Stressing the need for alleged perpetrators of crimes against children in 
situations of armed conflict to be brought to justice through national justice systems 
and, where applicable, international justice mechanisms and mixed criminal courts 
and tribunals in order to end impunity, 

 Noting also relevant provisions of the Rome Statute of the International 
Criminal Court, 

 1. Welcomes the appointment of the new Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict and highlights the importance of 
her work in carrying out her mandate for the protection of children in situations of 
armed conflict, in accordance with relevant Security Council resolutions;  

 2. Strongly condemns all violations of applicable international law 
involving the recruitment and use of children by parties to armed conflict as well as 
their re-recruitment, killing and maiming, rape and other sexual violence, abductions, 
attacks on schools and/or hospitals as well as denial of humanitarian access by parties 
to armed conflict and demands that all relevant parties immediately put an end to 
such practices and take special measures to protect children;  

 3. Expresses deep concern that certain perpetrators persist in committing 
violations and abuses against children in situations of armed conflict in open 
disregard of its resolutions on the matter, and in this regard: 

 (a) Calls upon Member States concerned to bring to justice those responsible 
for such violations through national justice systems, and where applicable, 
international justice mechanisms;  

 (b) Reiterates its readiness to adopt targeted and graduated measures against 
persistent perpetrators, taking into account relevant provisions of its resolutions 
1539 (2004), 1612 (2005), 1882 (2009) and 1998 (2011);  

 4. Invites the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to brief the 
Security Council on questions relating to the delisting process and progress made, 
enabling an exchange of views; 

 5. Reiterates its call upon the Working Group on Children and Armed 
Conflict to consider, with the support of the Special Representative for Children and 
Armed Conflict, within one year, a broad range of options for increasing pressure on 
persistent perpetrators of violations and abuses committed against children in 
situations of armed conflict;  



 S/2012/713
 

3 12-51547 
 

 6. Requests the Secretary-General to continue to submit annual reports to 
the Council on the implementation of its resolutions and Presidential statements on 
children and armed conflict, and to submit his next report by June 2013; 

 7. Decides to remain actively seized of this matter.
