Oceans and the law of the sea

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolutions 49/28 of 6 December 1994, 52/26 of 26 November
1997, 54/33 of 24 November 1999, 55/7 of 30 October 2000 and other relevant

integrity needs to be maintained, as recognized also by the United Nations
Conference on Environment and Development in chapter 17 of Agenda 21,3

Conscious of the importance of increasing the number of States parties to the
Convention and the Agreement in order to achieve the goal of universal
participation,

Conscious also that the problems of ocean space are closely interrelated and
need to be considered as a whole through an integrated, interdisciplinary and
intersectoral approach,

Convinced of the need, building on arrangements established in accordance
with the Convention, to improve coordination at the national level and cooperation
and coordination at both intergovernmental and inter-agency levels, in order to
address all aspects of oceans and seas in an integrated manner,

Recognizing the important role that the competent international organizations
have in relation to ocean affairs, in implementing the Convention and in promoting
the sustainable development of the oceans and seas,

Recalling that the role of international cooperation and coordination on a
bilateral basis and, where applicable, within a subregional, interregional, regional or
global framework is to support and supplement the national efforts of all States,
including coastal States, to promote the integrated management and sustainable
development of coastal and marine areas,

Mindful of the importance of the oceans and seas for the earth’s ecosystem and
for providing the vital resources for food security and for sustaining economic
prosperity and the well-being of present and future generations,

Bearing in mind the contribution that major groups, as identified in Agenda 21,
can make to raising awareness of the goal of the sustainable development of the
oceans and seas,

Underlining once again the essential need for capacity-building to ensure that
all States, especially developing countries, in particular least developed countries
and small island developing States, are able both to implement the Convention and
to benefit from the sustainable development of the oceans and seas, as well as to
participate fully in global and regional forums and processes dealing with oceans
and law of the sea issues,

Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General,4 and reaffirming the
importance of the annual consideration and review of developments relating to
ocean affairs and the law of the sea by the General Assembly as the global

General Assembly in its resolution 54/33 in order to facilitate the annual review by
the Assembly of developments in ocean affairs at its second meeting,5

Bearing in mind the importance of marine science, through improving
knowledge, by sustained research efforts and evaluation of monitoring results, and
applying such knowledge to management and decision-making, for eradicating
poverty, for contributing to food security, conserving the world’s marine
environment and resources, helping to understand, predict, mitigate the effects of
and respond to natural events, and for promoting the sustainable development of the
oceans and seas,

Reaffirming the need to achieve the effective application of marine scientific
knowledge and technology, through cooperation at the regional and global levels, by
ensuring access of decision makers to relevant advice and information, as well as to
the transfer of technology and support for the production and diffusion of factual
data and knowledge for end-users, as appropriate, taking fully into account socio-
economic factors and traditional ecological knowledge,

Emphasizing the urgent need for cooperation at the international level to
address the issue of the acquisition, generation and transfer of marine scientific data
to assist coastal developing States,

Convinced of the need to develop, where appropriate, a strong regional focus
in marine scientific research and technology, through existing regional
organizations, arrangements and programmes, so as to ensure the most effective use
of the available resources and the protection and preservation of the marine
environment, particularly by avoiding duplication and by achieving a holistic
approach to the scientific study of the oceans and their resources,

Expressing deep concern once again at the continued increase in the number of
incidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea, the harm they cause to seafarers, the
threats they pose to the safety of shipping and to the other uses of the sea, including
marine scientific research, and, consequently, to the marine and coastal
environment, which threats are further exacerbated by the involvement of
transnational organized crime,

Emphasizing, in this context, the need for the capacity-building and
cooperation of all States and relevant international bodies, at both the regional and
global levels, as well as the business sectors to prevent and combat piracy and
armed robbery at sea,

Recognizing the importance of enhancing the safety of navigation, the need to
provide accurate and up-to-date charts of the world oceans in order to promote
maritime safety, and the need to build hydrographic capacity, in particular for those
States that do not yet have adequate hydrographic services,

Reiterating its serious concern at the increase in illegal, unreported and
unregulated fishing, and recognizing the importance of combating such activities,
particularly by strengthening bilateral cooperation, as well as through the relevant
regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements, and through the
implementation of appropriate enforcement measures,

Expressing its deep concern once again at the degradation of the marine
environment, particularly from land-based activities, and emphasizing the need for
international cooperation and for a coordinated approach at the national and regional
levels to this problem, bringing together the many different economic sectors
involved and protecting the ecosystems, and in this context reaffirming the
importance of ensuring the full implementation of the Global Programme of Action
for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities,6

Reiterating its concern also at the adverse impacts on the marine environment
from ships, including pollution, in particular through the illegal release of oil and
other harmful substances, and by the dumping of hazardous waste, including
radioactive materials, nuclear waste and dangerous chemicals, as well as the
physical impacts on coral,

Welcoming resolution GC(45)RES/10 adopted on 21 September 2001 by the
General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency at its forty-fifth
regular session, concerning measures to strengthen international cooperation in
