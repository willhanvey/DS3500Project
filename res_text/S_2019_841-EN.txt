 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming its commitment to the continuing and full implementation, in a 

mutually reinforcing manner, of resolutions 1325 (2000), 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009), 

1889 (2009), 1960 (2010), 2106 (2013), 2122 (2013), 2242 (2015), and 2467 (2019) 

on Women, Peace and Security, and relevant statements of its Presidents, 

 Bearing in mind the Purposes and Principles of the Charter of the United 

Nations and the primary responsibility of the Security Council under the Charter for 

the maintenance of international peace and security,  

 Reaffirming in this regard the importance to achieve sustainable peace and 

security by dialogue, mediation, consultations and political negotiations to bridge 

differences and to end conflicts,  

 Recognizing the progress made as well as the opportunity and need for far 

greater implementation of the women, peace and security agenda, remaining deeply 

concerned by persisting barriers to the full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) 

and the frequent under-representation of women in many formal processes and bodies 

related to the maintenance of international peace and security, the relatively low 

number of women in senior positions in political, peace and security-related national, 

regional and international institutions, the lack of adequate gender-sensitive 

humanitarian responses and support for women’s leadership roles in these settings, 

insufficient financing for Women, Peace and Security, and the resulting detrimental 

impact on the maintenance of international peace and security,  

 Recognizing that an understanding of the impact of armed conflict on women 

and girls, effective institutional arrangements to guarantee their protection and full 

participation in the peace process can significantly contribute to the maintenance and 

promotion of international peace and security,  

 Recalling the commitments of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action 

and reaffirming the obligations of State Parties to the Convention on the Elimination 

of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Optional Protocol thereto, urging 

states that have not yet done so to consider ratifying or acceding to them, noting 

General Recommendation 30 of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination
