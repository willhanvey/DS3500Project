Concerned about the continued grave deterioration of the situation of
Palestinian children in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem,
the severely detrimental impact of the continuing Israeli assaults and sieges on
Palestinian cities, towns, villages and refugee camps, and the continuing dire
humanitarian crisis on the safety and well-being of Palestinian children,

Concerned also about the severely detrimental impact being caused by the
unlawful construction of the wall by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied
Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated
regime, on the socio-economic conditions of Palestinian children and their families
and on the enjoyment by Palestinian children of their right to education, to an
adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing, to
health, and to be free from hunger, in accordance with the Convention on the Rights
of the Child and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights,

Emphasizing the importance of the safety and well-being of all children in the
whole Middle East region,

Expressing its condemnation of all acts of violence, resulting in extensive loss
of human life and injuries, including among Palestinian children,

Deeply concerned about the negative consequences, including psychological
consequences, of the Israeli military actions for the present and future well-being of
Palestinian children,

1. Stresses the urgent need for Palestinian children to live a normal life free
from foreign occupation, destruction and fear in their own State;

2. Demands, in the meanwhile, that Israel, the occupying Power, respect
relevant provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child1 and comply fully
with the provisions of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian
Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949,6 in order to ensure the well-being and
protection of Palestinian children and their families;

3. Calls upon the international community to provide urgently needed
assistance and services in an effort to alleviate the dire humanitarian crisis being
faced by Palestinian children and their families and to help in the reconstruction of
relevant Palestinian institutions.
