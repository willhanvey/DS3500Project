 Welcoming the resolve expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration 
adopted by the General Assembly on 8 September 20006 to take measures to 
eliminate the increasing acts of racism and xenophobia in many societies and to 
promote greater harmony and tolerance in all societies, and looking forward to its 
effective implementation at all levels,  

 Underlining, in this regard, the importance of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference against Racism, Racial 
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, held in Durban, South Africa, 
from 31 August to 8 September 20017 and the outcome document of the Durban 
Review Conference, held in Geneva from 20 to 24 April 2009,8  

 Expressing serious concern at the increase in racist violence and xenophobic 
ideas in many parts of the world, in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion 
and in society at large, as a result, inter alia, of the resurgence of activities of 
political parties and associations established on the basis of racist, xenophobic and 
ideological superiority platforms and charters, and the persistent use of those 
platforms and charters to promote or incite racist ideologies,  

 Deeply alarmed at the rising trends towards discrimination based on religion 
or belief, including in some national policies, laws and administrative measures that 
stigmatize groups of people belonging to certain religions and beliefs under a 
variety of pretexts relating to security and irregular immigration, thereby 
legitimizing discrimination against them and consequently impairing their 
enjoyment of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and impeding 
their ability to observe, practise and manifest their religion freely and without fear 
of coercion, violence or reprisal, and, in this context, emphasizing the importance of 
article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,2  

 Noting with deep concern the serious instances of intolerance, discrimination 
and acts of violence based on religion or belief, intimidation and coercion motivated 
by extremism, religious or otherwise, occurring in many parts of the world, 
including cases motivated by Islamophobia, Judeophobia and Christianophobia, in 
addition to the negative projection of certain religions in the media and the 
introduction and enforcement of laws and administrative measures that specifically 
discriminate against and target persons with certain ethnic and religious 
backgrounds, particularly Muslim minorities, and that threaten to impede their full 
enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms,  

 Stressing that vilification of religions is a serious affront to human dignity 
leading to the illicit restriction of the freedom of religion of their adherents and 
incitement to religious hatred and violence,  

 Stressing also the need to effectively combat vilification of religions, and 
incitement to religious hatred in general,  

 Reaffirming that discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief constitutes 
a violation of human rights and a disavowal of the principles of the Charter,  

 Noting with concern that vilification of religions, and incitement to religious 
hatred in general, could lead to social disharmony and violations of human rights,

and alarmed at the inaction of some States to combat this burgeoning trend and the 
resulting discriminatory practices against adherents of certain religions,  

 Taking note of the reports of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance submitted to the 
Human Rights Council at its fourth, sixth, ninth and twelfth sessions,9 in which the 
Special Rapporteur highlighted the serious nature of the defamation of all religions 
and the need to complement legal strategies, and reiterating the call of the Special 
Rapporteur to all States to wage a systematic campaign against incitement to racial 
and religious hatred by maintaining a careful balance between the defence of 
secularism and respect for freedom of religion and by acknowledging and respecting 
the complementarity of all the freedoms embodied in internationally agreed human 
rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,  

 Recalling the proclamation of the Global Agenda for Dialogue among 
Civilizations,10 and inviting States, the organizations and bodies of the United 
Nations system, within existing resources, other international and regional 
organizations and civil society to contribute to the implementation of the 
Programme of Action contained in the Global Agenda,  

 Welcoming the efforts of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations initiative 
in promoting mutual respect and understanding among different cultures and 
societies, including its first forum, held in Spain in 2008, its second forum, held in 
Turkey in 2009, its third forum, held in Brazil in 2010, and its fourth forum, to be 
held in Qatar in 2011,  

 Convinced that respect for cultural, ethnic, religious and linguistic diversity, as 
well as dialogue among and within civilizations, is essential for global peace and 
understanding, while manifestations of cultural and ethnic prejudice, religious 
intolerance and xenophobia generate hatred and violence among peoples and nations,  

 Noting the various regional and national initiatives to combat religious and 
racial intolerance against specific groups and communities and emphasizing, in this 
context, the need to adopt a comprehensive and non-discriminatory approach to ensure 
respect for all races and religions, as well as various regional and national initiatives,  

 Underlining the important role of education in the promotion of tolerance, 
which involves acceptance by the public of, and its respect for, diversity, including 
with regard to religious expression, and underlining also the fact that education 
should contribute in a meaningful way to promoting tolerance and the elimination of 
discrimination based on religion or belief,  

 Emphasizing that States, regional organizations, non-governmental organizations, 
religious bodies and the media have an important role to play in promoting tolerance 
and respect for and freedom of religion and belief,  

 Welcoming, in this regard, all international and regional initiatives aimed at 
promoting cross-cultural and interfaith harmony, including the international dialogue 
on interfaith cooperation, the World Conference on Dialogue, held in Madrid from 
16 to 18 July 2008, and the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the 
culture of peace, held on 12 and 13 November 2008, and their valuable efforts

towards the promotion of a culture of peace and dialogue at all levels, and taking 
note with appreciation of the programmes led by the United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization in this regard,  

 Underlining the importance of increasing contacts at all levels in order to 
deepen dialogue and reinforce understanding among different cultures, religions, 
beliefs and civilizations, and in this regard taking note with appreciation of the 
Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the Ministerial Meeting on 
Human Rights and Cultural Diversity of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, 
held in Tehran on 3 and 4 September 2007,11  

 Recognizing the importance of the intersection of religion and race and that 
instances can arise of multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination on the basis of 
religion and other grounds, such as race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin,  

 Recalling its resolution 64/156 of 18 December 2009 and Human Rights Council 
resolution 13/16 of 15 April 2010,  

 1.  Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;12  

 2.  Expresses deep concern at the negative stereotyping of religions and 
manifestations of intolerance and discrimination in matters of religion or belief still 
evident in the world;  

 3.  Strongly deplores all acts of psychological and physical violence and 
assaults, and incitement thereto, against persons on the basis of their religion or 
belief, and such acts directed against their businesses, properties, cultural centres 
and places of worship, as well as the targeting and desecration of holy books, holy 
sites and religious symbols of all religions;  

 4.  Expresses deep concern at the programmes and agendas pursued by 
extremist organizations and groups aimed at creating and perpetuating stereotypes 
about certain religions, in particular when condoned by Governments;  

 5.  Notes with deep concern the intensification of the overall campaign of 
vilification of religions, and incitement to religious hatred in general, including the 
ethnic and religious profiling of religious minorities;  

 6.  Recognizes that, in the context of the fight against terrorism, vilification 
of religions, and incitement to religious hatred in general, become aggravating 
factors that contribute to the denial of fundamental rights and freedoms of members 
of target groups, as well as to their economic and social exclusion;  

 7.  Expresses deep concern, in this respect, that Islam is frequently and 
wrongly associated with human rights violations and terrorism;  

 8.  Reiterates the commitment of all States to the implementation, in an 
integrated manner, of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, which 
was adopted without a vote by the General Assembly on 8 September 2006,13 and 
reaffirmed by the Assembly in its resolutions 62/272 of 5 September 2008 and 
64/297 of 8 September 2010, which clearly confirms, inter alia, that terrorism 
cannot and should not be associated with any religion, nationality, civilization or

ethnic group, stressing the need to reinforce the commitment of the international 
community to promote a culture of peace, justice and human development, ethnic, 
national and religious tolerance, and respect for all religions, religious values, 
beliefs or cultures and prevent the vilification of religions;  

 9.  Deplores the use of the print, audio-visual and electronic media, 
including the Internet, and any other means to incite acts of violence, xenophobia or 
related intolerance and discrimination against any religion, as well as the targeting 
and desecration of holy books, holy sites, places of worship and religious symbols 
of all religions;  

 10.  Emphasizes that, as stipulated in international human rights law, 
everyone has the right to hold opinions without interference and has the right to 
freedom of expression, the exercise of which carries with it special duties and 
responsibilities and may therefore be subject to limitations as are provided for by 
law and are necessary for respect of the rights or reputations of others, protection of 
national security or of public order, public health or morals;  

 11.  Reaffirms that general recommendation XV (42) of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination,14 in which the Committee stipulated that the 
prohibition of the dissemination of all ideas based upon racial superiority or hatred 
is compatible with freedom of opinion and expression, is equally applicable to the 
question of incitement to religious hatred;  

 12.  Takes note of the work undertaken by the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression in accordance with their mandates defined by 
the Human Rights Council in its resolutions 7/34 and 7/36 of 28 March 2008;15  

 13.  Strongly condemns all manifestations and acts of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance against national or ethnic, 
religious and linguistic minorities and migrants and the stereotypes often applied to 
them, including on the basis of religion or belief, and urges all States to apply and, 
where applicable, reinforce existing laws when such xenophobic or intolerant acts, 
manifestations or expressions occur in order to eradicate impunity for those who 
commit xenophobic and racist acts;  

 14.  Calls upon all States to adopt necessary measures, including by adopting 
legislation, according to their international obligations, to prohibit the advocacy of 
national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, 
hostility or violence, and encourages States, in their follow-up to the World 
Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related 
Intolerance, to include aspects relating to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic 
minorities in their national plans of action and in this context to take forms of 
multiple discrimination against minorities fully into account;  

 15.  Invites all States to put into practice the provisions of the Declaration on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion 
or Belief;3

and that any necessary and appropriate education or training is provided;

practice, including access to free primary education for all children, both girls and

support and foster such a dialogue;  

 24.  Affirms that the Human Rights Council shall promote universal respect 
for all religious and cultural values and address instances of intolerance, 
discrimination and incitement of hatred against members of any community or 
adherents of any religion, as well as the means to consolidate international efforts in 
order to combat impunity for such deplorable acts;  

 25.  Welcomes the statement made on 30 September 2010 by the President of 
the Human Rights Council on behalf of all the members of the Council condemning 



 A/C.3/65/L.46/Rev.1
 

7 10-64489 
 

the recent instances of religious intolerance, prejudice and related discrimination 
and violence, which continued to occur in all parts of the world;  

 26.  Also welcomes the initiative of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights on the expert seminar on freedom of expression and advocacy of 
religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, 
held on 2 and 3 October 2008, and requests the High Commissioner to continue to 
build on this initiative, with a view to concretely contributing to the prevention and

individuals and their communities;  

 27.  Takes note of the efforts of the High Commissioner to promote and 
include human rights aspects in educational programmes, particularly the World

system and coordinate their contribution to the intergovernmental process;  

 28.  Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report on the implementation 
of the present resolution, including the correlation between defamation of religions
