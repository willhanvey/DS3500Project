Pakistan: draft resolution

Confidence-building measures in the regional and
subregional context

The General Assembly,

Guided by the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United
Nations,

Recalling its resolution 57/337 of 3 July 2003 entitled “Prevention of armed
conflict”, in which it calls upon Member States to settle their disputes by peaceful
means, as set out in Chapter VI of the Charter, inter alia, by any procedures adopted
by the parties, including the most effective use of the International Court of Justice,

Recalling the Security Council resolutions relating to the prevention of armed
conflict, and noting all Security Council presidential statements related to this
matter,

Considering the importance and effectiveness of confidence-building measures
taken at the initiative and with the participation of all States concerned, and taking
into account the specific characteristics of each region, since such measures can
contribute to regional stability,

Convinced that resources released by disarmament, including regional
disarmament, can be devoted to economic and social development and to the
protection of the environment for the benefit of all peoples, in particular those of the
developing countries,

Recognizing the need for meaningful dialogue in the regions of tension to avert
conflict,

Welcoming the peace processes already initiated by regions to resolve their
disputes through peaceful means bilaterally or through mediation by third parties,
regional organizations or the United Nations,

A/C.1/58/L.18

Recognizing that some regions have already taken steps towards confidence-
building measures at the bilateral, subregional and regional levels in the political
and military fields, including arms control and disarmament, and noting that such
measures have immensely improved peace and security in those regions and have
resulted in rapid progress in the socio-economic conditions of their people,

Concerned that the continuation of disputes among States, particularly in the
absence of an effective mechanism to resolve them through peaceful means, may
contribute to the arms race and endanger the maintenance of international peace and
security and the efforts of the international community to promote arms control and
disarmament,

1. Calls upon Member States to refrain from the use or threat of use of force
in the settlement of disputes;

2. Reaffirms its commitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes under
Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations, which calls for the peaceful
settlement of disputes, in particular Article 33, which provides for a solution by
negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort
to regional agencies or arrangements or other peaceful means chosen by the parties;

3. Calls upon Member States that have not already done so to open
consultations and dialogue in the regions of tension and conflict without
preconditions;

4. Urges strict compliance with bilateral, regional and international arms
control and disarmament agreements to which the contending States are parties;

5. Urges also, in the context of confidence-building measures, the
maintenance of military balance between States in the regions of tension and
conflict in the acquisition, development and deployment of conventional and
strategic weapon systems;

6. Encourages the promotion of bilateral and regional confidence-building
measures to avoid conflict and prevent the unintended and accidental outbreak of
hostilities;

7. Requests the Secretary-General to consult with the States of the regions
concerned in order to ascertain their views on the issue and to promote consultations
among them with a view to exploring the best possibilities for furthering efforts
towards confidence-building measures in the regions of tensions;

8. Also requests the Secretary-General to report on the subject to the
General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session;

9. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-ninth session an
item entitled “Confidence-building measures in the regional and subregional
context”.
