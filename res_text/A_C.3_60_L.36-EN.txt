economic and social advancement of all peoples,

Recalling that the Declaration on the Right to Development, adopted by the
General Assembly in its resolution 41/128 of 4 December 1986, confirmed that the
right to development is an inalienable human right and that equality of opportunity
for development is a prerogative both of nations and of individuals who make up
nations, and that the individual is the central subject and beneficiary of
development,

Stressing that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action1 reaffirmed
the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of
fundamental human rights, and the individual as the central subject and beneficiary
of development,

Reaffirming the objective of making the right to development a reality for
everyone, as set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, adopted by the

and development, particularly of developing countries”,4

Recalling all its previous resolutions and those of the Commission on Human
Rights on the right to development, in particular Commission resolution 1998/72 of
22 April 1998,5 on the urgent need to make further progress towards the realization
of the right to development as set out in the Declaration on the Right to
Development,

at Durban, South Africa, from 17 to 19 August 2004,

Reiterating its continuing support for the New Partnership for Africa’s
Development6 as a development framework for Africa,

Recognizing that historical injustices have undeniably contributed to the
poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion, economic disparity,
instability and insecurity that affect many people in different parts of the world, in
particular in developing countries,

Stressing that poverty eradication is one of the critical elements in the
promotion and realization of the right to development and that poverty is a
multifaceted problem that requires a multifaceted and integrated approach in
addressing economic, political, social, environmental and institutional dimensions at
all levels, especially in the context of the millennium development goal of halving,
by 2015, the proportion of the world’s people whose income is less than one dollar a
day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger,

development and suggest criteria for its periodic evaluation with the aim of

the right to development;

4. Stresses the importance of the core principles contained in the
conclusions of the Working Group at its third session,8 congruent with the purpose

accountability, participation and international cooperation, as critical to
mainstreaming the right to development at the national and international levels, and
underlines the importance of the principles of equity and transparency;

5. Notes with concern that the Subcommission on the Promotion and
Protection of Human Rights has not submitted the concept document establishing

critical to achieving the objectives, goals and targets set in those outcome
documents;

8. Also reaffirms that the realization of the right to development is essential
to the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action,1 which
regards all human rights as universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated,
places the human person at the centre of development and recognizes that, while
development facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights, the lack of development
may not be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally recognized human
rights;

9. Stresses that the basic responsibility for the promotion and protection of
all human rights lies with the State, and reaffirms that States have the primary
responsibility for their own economic and social development and that the role of
national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized;

13. Emphasizes the critical importance of identifying and analysing obstacles
impeding the full realization of the right to development at both the national and the
international levels;

14. Affirms that, while globalization offers both opportunities and challenges,
the process of globalization remains deficient in achieving the objectives of

and measures at the national and global levels to respond to the challenges and
opportunities of globalization if this process is to be made fully inclusive and
equitable;

15. Recognizes that, despite continuous efforts on the part of the
international community, the gap between developed and developing countries
remains unacceptably wide, that developing countries continue to face difficulties in
participating in the globalization process and that many risk being marginalized and
effectively excluded from its benefits;

16. Underlines the fact that the international community is far from meeting
the target set in the Millennium Declaration of halving the number of people living

commitment, between developed and developing countries towards achieving the
goal;

17. Urges developed countries that have not yet done so to make concrete

countries to build on the progress achieved in ensuring that official development
assistance is used effectively to help to meet development goals and targets;

18. Recognizes the need to address market access for developing countries,
including in agriculture, services and non-agricultural products, in particular those
of interest to developing countries;

19. Calls for the implementation of a desirable pace of meaningful trade
liberalization, including in areas under negotiation; implementation of commitments
on implementation-related issues and concerns; review of special and differential-
treatment provisions, with a view to strengthening them and making them more
precise, effective and operational; avoidance of new forms of protectionism; and
capacity-building and technical assistance for developing countries as important
issues in making progress towards the effective implementation of the right to
development;

20. Recognizes the important link between the international economic,
commercial and financial spheres and the realization of the right to development,
stresses, in this regard, the need for good governance and broadening the base of
decision-making at the international level on issues of development concern and the
need to fill organizational gaps, as well as strengthen the United Nations system and
other multilateral institutions, and also stresses the need to broaden and strengthen

A/C.3/60/L.36

the participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition
in international economic decision-making and norm-setting;

21. Also recognizes that good governance and the rule of law at the national
level assist all States in the promotion and protection of human rights, including the
right to development, and agrees on the value of the ongoing efforts being made by
States to identify and strengthen good governance practices, including transparent,
responsible, accountable and participatory government, that are responsive and
appropriate to their needs and aspirations, including in the context of agreed
partnership approaches to development, capacity-building and technical assistance;

22. Further recognizes the important role and the rights of women and the
application of a gender perspective as a cross-cutting issue in the process of

between women’s education and their equal participation in the civil, cultural,
economic, political and social activities of the community and the promotion of the
right to development;

23. Stresses the need for the integration of the rights of children, girls and
boys alike, in all policies and programmes, and for ensuring the promotion and
protection of those rights, especially in areas relating to health, education and the
full development of their capacities;

24. Also stresses that further and additional measures must be taken at the
national and international levels to fight HIV/AIDS and other communicable
diseases, taking into account ongoing efforts and programmes, and reiterates the
need for international assistance in this regard;

25. Recognizes the need for strong partnerships with civil society
organizations and the private sector in pursuit of poverty eradication and
development, as well as for corporate social responsibility;

26. Emphasizes the urgent need for taking concrete measures to fight against
all forms of corruption at the national and international levels, to prevent, detect and
deter in a more effective manner international transfers of illicitly acquired assets
and to strengthen international cooperation in asset recovery, stresses the importance
of a genuine political commitment on the part of all Governments through a firm
legal framework, and in this context urges States to sign and ratify as soon as
possible, and States parties to implement effectively, the United Nations Convention
against Corruption;10

27. Also emphasizes the need to strengthen further the activities of the Office
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the promotion and

necessary resources;

28. Reaffirms the request to the High Commissioner, in mainstreaming the
right to development, to undertake effectively activities aimed at strengthening the
