economic development of states in the region, 

 Recalling its statement of 30 August 2011 on piracy and armed robbery at sea 
in the Gulf of Guinea, 

 Expressing its concern over the threat that piracy and armed robbery at sea 
pose to the safety of seafarers and other persons, including through their being taken 
as hostages, and deeply concerned by the violence employed by pirates and persons 
involved in piracy and armed robbery at sea in the Gulf of Guinea, 

 Affirming its respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the States of 
the Gulf of Guinea and their neighbours, 

 Further affirming that the provisions of this resolution apply only with respect 
to the situation in the Gulf of Guinea, 

 Affirming that international law, as reflected in the United Nations Convention 
on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982, in particular its articles 100, 101 and 
105, sets out the legal framework applicable to countering piracy and armed robbery 
at sea, as well as other ocean activities,  

 Noting that applicable international legal instruments provide for parties to 
create criminal offences, establish jurisdiction, and prosecute or extradite for 
prosecution, persons responsible for or suspected of seizing or exercising control 
over a ship or fixed platform by force or threat thereof or any other form of 
intimidation, 

 Emphasizing the importance of finding a comprehensive solution to the 
problem of piracy and armed robbery at sea in the Gulf of Guinea,
