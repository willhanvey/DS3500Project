  Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty 
 
 

 The General Assembly,  

 Reiterating that the cessation of nuclear-weapon test explosions or any other 
nuclear explosions constitutes an effective nuclear disarmament and 
non-proliferation measure, and convinced that this is a meaningful step in the 
realization of a systematic process to achieve nuclear disarmament,  

 Recalling that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, adopted by its 
resolution 50/245 of 10 September 1996, was opened for signature on 24 September 
1996, 

 Stressing that a universal and effectively verifiable Treaty constitutes a 
fundamental instrument in the field of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation 
and that, after more than twelve years, its entry into force is more urgent than ever 
before,  

 Encouraged by the signing of the Treaty by one hundred and eighty-two 
States, including forty-one of the forty-four needed for its entry into force, and 
welcoming the ratification of one hundred and fifty-three States, including thirty-
five of the forty-four needed for its entry into force, among which there are three 
nuclear-weapon States, 

 Recalling its resolution 64/69 of 2 December 2009,

 Welcoming the adoption by consensus of the conclusions and recommendations 
for follow-on actions of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on 
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,1 which, inter alia, reaffirmed the vital 
importance of the entry into force of the Treaty as a core element of the 
international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and included 
specific actions to be taken in support of the entry into force of the Treaty,  

 Welcoming the Joint Ministerial Statement on the Comprehensive Nuclear-
Test-Ban Treaty, adopted at the Ministerial Meeting held in New York on 
23 September 2010,  

 Welcoming also the Final Declaration of the Sixth Conference on Facilitating 
the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, held in New 
York on 24 and 25 September 2009, pursuant to article XIV of the Treaty,2 and 
noting the improved prospects for ratification in several Annex 2 countries,  

 1. Stresses the vital importance and urgency of signature and ratification, 
without delay and without conditions, to achieve the earliest entry into force of the 
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty;3 

 2. Welcomes the contributions by the States signatories to the work of the 
Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty 
Organization, in particular its efforts to ensure that the Treaty’s verification regime 
will be capable of meeting the verification requirements of the Treaty upon its entry 
into force, in accordance with article IV of the Treaty;  

 3. Underlines the need to maintain momentum towards completion of all 
elements of the verification regime; 

 4. Urges all States not to carry out nuclear-weapon test explosions or any 
other nuclear explosions, to maintain their moratoriums in this regard and to refrain 
from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of the Treaty, while stressing that 
these measures do not have the same permanent and legally binding effect as the 
entry into force of the Treaty;  

 5. Recalls Security Council resolutions 1718 (2006) of 14 October 2006 and 
1874 (2009) of 12 June 2009, emphasizes the importance of their implementation, 
and reaffirms its firm support for the Six-Party Talks; 

 6. Urges all States that have not yet signed the Treaty to sign and ratify it as 
soon as possible; 

 7. Urges all States that have signed but not yet ratified the Treaty, in 
particular those whose ratification is needed for its entry into force, to accelerate 
their ratification processes with a view to ensuring their earliest successful 
conclusion;  

 8. Welcomes, since the last session of the General Assembly, the ratification 
of the Treaty by the Central African Republic, the Marshall Islands and Trinidad and 
Tobago, as significant steps towards the early entry into force of the Treaty;

to pursue and complete the ratification process;

bilateral and joint outreach, seminars and other means;  

 11. Requests the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Preparatory 
Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, to 
prepare a report on the efforts of States that have ratified the Treaty towards its 
universalization and possibilities for providing assistance on ratification procedures 
to States that so request it, and to submit such a report to the General Assembly at 
its sixty-sixth session;
