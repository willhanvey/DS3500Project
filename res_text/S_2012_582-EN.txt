 Bearing in mind the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July

S/2012/582  
 

12-44731 2 
 

welcoming initial progress but deploring the serious delays in the implementation of 
the DDPD, urging the Government of Sudan and the Liberation and Justice 
Movement to accelerate the implementation of the DDPD in order to deliver real 
benefits for the Darfuri people, and encouraging the international community to 
assist the signatories in this regard, deploring also the fact that some armed groups 
have refused to join the process and are impeding implementation of the DDPD and 
strongly urging them to support the process, condemning any actions by any armed 
group aimed at forced overthrow of the Government of Sudan, and strongly urging 
the Government of Sudan and all the armed groups, including the Sudan Liberation 
Army, Abdul Wahid faction (SLA/AW), the Sudan Liberation Army, Minni Minawi

effort to reach a comprehensive peace settlement on the basis of the DDPD, and to 
agree upon a permanent ceasefire without further delay or preconditions, 

 Underlining, without prejudice to the Security Council’s primary responsibility 
for the maintenance of international peace and security, the importance of the 
partnership between the United Nations and the AU, consistent with Chapter VIII of 
the United Nations Charter, with regard to the maintenance of peace and security in 
Africa, particularly in Sudan, and welcoming, in particular, the efforts of the AU 
High-level Implementation Panel for Sudan under the leadership of President Mbeki 
working in cooperation with UNAMID, to address in a comprehensive and inclusive 
manner the challenges of peace, justice and reconciliation in Darfur, 

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 16 July (S/2012/548) on

peacekeeping deployments, with a view to enhancing the effectiveness of 
peacekeeping missions; encouraging the full implementation by UNAMID of its 
Chapter VII mandate; underlining, in this regard, the importance of UNAMID 
deterring any threats to the implementation of its mandate, and the safety and security 
of its peacekeeping personnel in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations; 
and noting the need to raise the operational and self-sustainment capabilities of 
military and police contingents to the agreed levels, 

 Expressing deep concern at the increased violence and insecurity in some parts 
of Darfur in recent months, and at confrontations between the Government of Sudan 
and the armed groups, expressing deep concern that such clashes, including attacks 
by rebel groups and aerial bombardment by the Government of Sudan, inter-tribal 
fighting, banditry and criminality continue to threaten civilians, and that attacks on 
humanitarian personnel and peacekeepers continue to restrict humanitarian access to 
conflict areas where vulnerable civilian populations reside, while noting the 
Secretary-General’s observation that the security situation in Darfur has improved 
since the deployment of UNAMID, calling on all parties to cease hostilities, 
including all acts of violence committed against civilians, and urgently facilitate 
unhindered humanitarian access in accordance with international law, including 
applicable international humanitarian law and the guiding principles of 
humanitarian assistance, 

 Recalling the commitments made by the Government of Sudan and the 
Liberation and Justice Movement in the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur 
(DDPD) to ensure the unimpeded access of humanitarian assistance to the 
population in need and the protection of humanitarian workers and their operations

in areas under their control, as well as to guarantee UNAMID unimpeded freedom 
of movement in all areas and at all times in Darfur in the exercise of its mandate, 

 Welcoming the potentially encouraging trend of voluntary returns of IDPs and 
refugees to their villages and places of origin, which were, according to the figures 
available to the Secretary-General, greater than new displacements in recent months, 
but expressing deep concern that new displacements continue to occur and at the 
fact that approximately two million IDPs and refugees remain displaced, 
recognizing that some displaced will settle permanently in urban areas, but 
underlining the need to ensure security in areas of return,  

 Expressing its concern at the hostilities between the Government of Sudan and 
the Sudan Liberation Army, Abdul Wahid faction (SLA/AW), the Sudan Liberation 
Army, Minni Minawi faction (SLA/MM), and the Justice and Equality Movement 
(JEM), and reiterating that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Darfur, 
and that an inclusive political settlement is essential to re-establishing peace,  

 Expressing concern about reported links between non-signatory armed groups 
in Darfur and groups outside Darfur, and demanding that any form of direct or 
indirect external support for such groups ceases, 

 Reiterating its condemnation of all violations of international human rights 
and humanitarian law in Darfur and in relation to Darfur, calling on all parties to 
comply with their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian 
law, emphasizing the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes, and

undermine the parties’ full and constructive efforts towards peace; 

 14. While noting that the overall humanitarian situation in Darfur has not 
deteriorated, expresses its serious concern at the fact that it has not improved, and at 
the threats to humanitarian organizations that persist, and the increased restrictions 
on humanitarian access in Darfur resulting from increased insecurity, attacks against 
humanitarian workers, denial of access by the parties to the conflict and bureaucratic

verifying the extent to which these returns are voluntary and informed in nature and 
expresses deep concern over some bureaucratic obstacles that undermine its 
effectiveness and independence; 

 19. Notes that security and freedom of movement will greatly facilitate 
recovery initiatives and a return to normalcy in Darfur; stresses the importance of

the United Nations country team and expert agencies on recovery and reconstruction
