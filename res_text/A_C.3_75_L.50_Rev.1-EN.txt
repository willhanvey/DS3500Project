of racism and adequate remedies for victims, and noting with concern the lack of 

effective implementation thereof,  

 Alarmed at the global rise in hate speech, constituting incitement to racial 

discrimination, hostility and violence, stressing the importance of addressing it, and 

in this regard noting the launch of the United Nations Strategy and Plan of Action on 

Hate Speech in June 2019, 

 Underlining the need to promote tolerance, inclusion and respect for diversity 

and the need to seek common ground among and within civilizations in order to 

address common challenges to humanity that threaten shared values, universal human

intolerance, through cooperation, partnership and inclusion,  

 Alarmed at the spread in many parts of the world of various racist extremist

xenophobia and related intolerance in many regions of the world, often targeting 

migrants and refugees, as well as people of African descent, expressing concern that 

some political leaders and parties have supported such an environment, and in this 

context expressing its support for migrants and refugees in the context of the severe 

discrimination that they may face,

rights violations by law enforcement officers against peaceful demonstrators

perpetrated by law enforcement agencies against Africans and people of African 

descent,

intolerance have a deep negative impact on the enjoyment of human rights, and 

therefore require a united and comprehensive response from the international 

community, 

 Recalling the three Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial 

Discrimination previously declared by the General Assembly, and regretting that the 

Programmes of Action for those Decades were not fully implemented and that their 

objectives have yet to be attained,  

 Reiterating that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights 

and have the potential to contribute constructively to the development and well -being 

of their societies, and that any doctrine of racial superiority is scientifically false, 

morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and must be rejected, together 

with theories that attempt to determine the existence of separate human races,  

 Underlining the intensity, magnitude and organized nature of slavery and the 

slave trade, including the transatlantic slave trade, and the associated hi storical 

injustices, as well as the untold suffering caused by colonialism and apartheid, and 

that Africans and people of African descent, Asians and people of Asian descent and 

indigenous peoples continue to be victims, and acknowledging that the ongoing 

effects must be remedied,
