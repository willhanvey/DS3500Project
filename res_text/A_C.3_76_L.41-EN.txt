 Stressing the importance of the World Conference on Human Rights, held in 

Vienna in 1993, and that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action 4 

reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral 

part of fundamental human rights and the individual as the central subject and 

beneficiary of development, 

 Reaffirming the objective of making the right to development a reality for 

everyone, as set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, adopted by the 

General Assembly on 8 September 2000,5

through a credible, effective and universal commitment to the means of 

implementation by all stakeholders,  

 Recognizing also the successful conclusion of the United Nations Conference 

on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III), held in Quito from 17 

to 20 October 2016, that recognizes that the New Urban Agenda7 is grounded in the 

Universal Declaration of Human Rights, international human rights treaties, the 

Millennium Declaration and the 2005 World Summit Outcome 8 and is informed by 

other instruments such as the Declaration on the Right to Development,  

 Recalling the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on 

Sustainable Development, entitled “The future we want”, 9 

 Reaffirming the universality, indivisibility, interrelatedness, interdependence 

and mutually reinforcing nature of all human rights, including civil, cultural, 

economic, political and social rights, including the right to development, and that they 

must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the 

same emphasis.

of poverty and inequity on indigenous peoples by ensuring their full and effective 

inclusion in development and poverty eradication programmes,  

 Reaffirming that democracy, development and respect for all human rights and 

fundamental freedoms for all are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that 

democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own 

political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in all 

aspects of their lives, and in that context noting that the promotion and protection of 

human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels should 

be universal and conducted without conditions attached and that the international 

community should support the strengthening and promotion of democracy, 

development and respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all in the 

entire world,

and across all spheres of society, including on livelihoods, food security and nutrition, 

and education, the exacerbation of poverty and hunger, disruption to economies, 

trade, societies and environments, and the exacerbation of economic and social 

inequalities within and among countries,  

 Recognizing also that the poorest and most vulnerable are the hardest hit by the 

pandemic and that the impact of the crisis will reverse hard-won development gains 

and hamper progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, as well 

as progress with regard to the right to development, 

 Deeply concerned about the uneven access of developing countries to safe, 

quality, efficacious, effective, accessible and affordable vaccines against COVID -19, 

and emphasizing that the realization of the right to development would enha nce the 

capacities of developing countries to have equal access to vaccines and other means 

to respond to and recover from the pandemic, as well as the need to strengthen the 

support for national, bilateral, regional and multilateral initiatives that aim t o 

accelerate the development and production of and equitable access to COVID-19 

diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines,   

 Recognizing that, while development facilitates the enjoyment of all human 

rights, the lack of development may not be invoked to justify the abridgement of 

internationally recognized human rights,  

 Recognizing also that Member States should cooperate with one another in 

ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development, that the international  

community should promote effective international cooperation, in particular to 

revitalize a global partnership for development, for the realization of the right to 

development and the elimination of obstacles to development and that lasting 

progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective 

development policies at the national level, as well as equitable economic relations 

and a favourable economic environment at the international level,  

 Recognizing further that poverty is an affront to human dignity,  

 Recognizing that extreme poverty and hunger are among the greatest global 

threats and require the collective commitment of the international community for their 

eradication, pursuant to Millennium Development Goal 1 and Sustainable Development 

Goals 1 and 2, and therefore calling upon the international community, including the 

Human Rights Council, to contribute towards achieving that goal,  

 Recognizing also that historical injustices, inter alia, have contributed to the 

poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion, economic disparity, 

instability and insecurity that affect many people in different parts of the world, in 

particular in developing countries,  

 Recognizing further that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, 

including extreme poverty, is one of the critical elements in the promotion and 

realization of the right to development and is the greatest global challenge and an 

indispensable requirement for sustainable development, which requires a 

multifaceted and integrated approach, and committed to achieving sustainable 

development in its three dimensions – economic, social and environmental – in a 

balanced and integrated manner, 

 Emphasizing that all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the 

right to development, are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated,  

 Emphasizing also that the right to development is vital for the full realization of 

the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and should be central to its 

implementation,

its agenda promotes and advances sustainable development, including the 2030 

Agenda for Sustainable Development, which seeks to build on the Millennium 

Development Goals and complete what they did not achieve, and also in this regard 

to lead the raising of the right to development, as set out in paragraphs 5 and 10 of 

the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, to the same level as and on a par 

with all other human rights and fundamental freedoms;  

 4. Supports the realization of the mandate of the Working Group on the Right 

to Development, 16  and recognizes the need for renewed efforts with a view to

resolution 1998/72 and the Human Rights Council in its resolution 4/4 of 30 March 

2007;17 

 5. Stresses the importance of the core principles contained in the conclusions 

of the Working Group at its third session18 that are congruent with the purpose of 

international human rights instruments, such as equal ity, non-discrimination, 

accountability, participation and international cooperation, as critical to mainstreaming  

the right to development at the national and international levels, and underlines the 

importance of the principles of equity and transparency; 

 6. Takes note of the convening of the twenty-first session of the Working 

Group;

 8. Calls upon Member States to contribute to the efforts of the Working 

Group, including, inter alia, on the elaboration of a draft legally binding instrument 

on the right to development on the basis of the draft prepared by the Chair-Rapporteur, 

as decided by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 42/23 of 27 September 

2019,20 and in this regard notes the report of the Chair-Rapporteur entitled “Draft 

convention on the right to development”,21  submitted to the Working Group at its 

twenty-first session; 

 9. Stresses that it is important that the Chair-Rapporteur and the Working 

Group, in the discharge of their mandates, take into account the need:  

 (a) To promote the democratization of the system of international governance 

in order to increase the effective participation of developing countries in international 

decision-making; 

 (b) To also promote effective partnerships such as the New Partnership for 

Africa’s Development and other similar initiatives with the developing countries, 

particularly the least developed countries, for the purpose of the realization of the ir 

right to development, including the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals;  

 (c) To strive for greater acceptance, operationalization and realization of the 

right to development at the international level, while urging all States to undertake at 

the national level the necessary policy formulation and to institute the measures 

required for the implementation of the right to development as an integral part of all 

human rights and fundamental freedoms, and also while urging all States to expand 

and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation in ensuring development and eliminating 

obstacles to development in the context of promoting effective international 

cooperation for the realization of the right to development, bearing in mind that 

lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires 

effective development policies at the national level and a favourable economic 

environment at the international level;  

 (d) To consider ways and means to continue to ensure the operationaliza tion 

of the right to development as a priority, including in the context of the response to 

and the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, through equitable and fair access for 

all countries, particularly the most vulnerable countries and countries in specia l 

situations, to vaccines and medicines as global public goods, sharing the benefits of 

scientific progress, financial and technological support and debt relief;  

 (e) To mainstream the right to development into the policies and operational 

activities of the specialized agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations 

system, as well as in the policies and strategies of the international financial and 

multilateral trading systems, bearing in mind in this regard that the core principles of 

the international economic, commercial and financial spheres, such as equity, 

non-discrimination, transparency, accountability, participation and international 

cooperation, including effective partnerships for development, are indispensable in 

achieving the right to development and preventing discriminatory treatment arising 

from political or other non-economic considerations in addressing the issues of 

concern to the developing countries;  

 10. Encourages the Human Rights Council to continue to consider how to 

ensure follow-up to the work of the former Subcommission on the Promotion and 

Protection of Human Rights on the right to development, in accordance with the 

relevant provisions of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the

Commission on Human Rights and in compliance with decisions to be taken by the 

Council; 

 11. Takes note of the convening, in 2020, of the first and second sessions, and 

in 2021, of the third and fourth sessions of the Expert Mechanism on the Right to 

Development, established by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 42/23, and 

noting the annual report of the Expert Mechanism;22  

 12. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Special Rapporteur of the 

Human Rights Council on the right to development,23 in which the Special Rapporteur 

explores the relationship between the right to development and climate change;  

 13. Stresses that South-South cooperation is not a substitute for, but rather a 

complement to, North-South cooperation and hence should not result in a reduction 

of North-South cooperation or hamper progress in fulfilling existing official 

development assistance commitments, and encourages Member States and other 

relevant stakeholders to incorporate the right to development into the design, 

financing and implementation of cooperation processes;  

 14. Urges Member States, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 

for Human Rights and other relevant specialized agencies, funds and programmes of 

the United Nations system to provide the Special Rapporteur on the right to

mandate;

the outcome documents of the major United Nations conferences and summits and 

their review processes, in particular those relating to the realization of the right to 

development, recognizing that the realization of the right to development is critical 

to achieving the objectives, goals and targets set out in those outcome documents;  

 16. Also reaffirms that the realization of the right to development is essential 

to the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which 

regards all human rights as universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, 

places the human person at the centre of development and recognizes that, while 

development facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights, a lack of development may 

not be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally recognized human rights; 

 17. Further reaffirms that development contributes significantly to the 

enjoyment of all human rights by all, and calls upon all countries to realize people -

centred development of the people, by the people and for the people; 

 18. Calls upon all States to spare no effort in promoting and protecting all 

human rights for all, including the right to development, in particular while 

implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and responding to and 

recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, as it is conducive to the overall enjoyment 

of human rights; 

 19. Stresses that the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection 

of all human rights lies with the State, and reaffirms that States have the primary 

responsibility for their own economic and social development and that the role of 

national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized;  

 20. Reaffirms the primary responsibility of States to create national and 

international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to development, as

 21. Also reaffirms its commitment to international cooperation and 

multilateralism and its strong support for the central role of the United Nations system 

in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic;  

 22. Further reaffirms its resolution 74/274 of 20 April 2020, in which it 

recognized the importance of international cooperation and effective multilateralism 

in helping to ensure that all States have in place effective national protective 

measures, access to and flow of vital medical supplies, therapeutics, medicines and 

vaccines, in order to minimize negative effects in all affected States and to avoid 

relapses of the COVID-19 pandemic;  

 23. Calls upon Member States and relevant stakeholders to strengthen 

international cooperation, as well as their support for multilateral efforts and for the 

central role of the United Nations system, in order to mobilize a coordinated global 

response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse social, economic and financial 

impact on all societies that contributes to the realization of the right to development 

and leaves no one behind;  

 24. Expresses concern about the increasing cases of human rights violations 

and abuses by some transnational corporations and other business enterprises, 

underlines the need to ensure that appropriate protection, justice and remedies are 

provided to the victims of human rights violations and abuses resulting from their 

activities, and underscores the fact that these entities must contribute to the means of 

implementation for the realization of the right to development;  

 25. Reaffirms the need for an international environment that is conducive to 

the realization of the right to development;  

 26. Emphasizes the critical importance of identifying and analysing obstacles 

impeding the full realization of the right to development at both the national and 

international levels, including in the context of the response to and the recovery from 

the COVID-19 pandemic; 

 27. Reaffirms that, while globalization offers both opportunities and challenges,  

the process of globalization remains deficient in achieving the objectives of integrating  

all countries into a globalized world, stresses the need for policies and measures at 

the national and global levels to respond to the challenges and opportunities of 

globalization if this process is to be made fully inclusive and equitable, and 

recognizes that globalization has brought disparities between and within countries 

and that issues such as trade and trade liberalization, the transfer of technology, 

infrastructure development and market access should be managed effectively in order 

to mitigate the challenges of poverty and underdevelopment and to make the right to 

development a reality for everyone;  

 28. Recognizes that, despite continuous efforts on the part of the international 

community, the gap between developed and developing countries remains unacceptably

challenges posed by global climate change and the loss of biodiversity, which have
