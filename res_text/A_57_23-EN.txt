Sir,

I have the honour to transmit herewith to the General Assembly the report of
the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in
accordance with General Assembly resolution 56/74 of 10 December 2001. The
report covers the work of the Special Committee during 2002.

(Signed) Earl Stephen Huntley
Chairman of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard

to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples

His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan
Secretary-General of the United Nations

Chapter I
Establishment, organization and activities of the
Special Committee

A. Establishment of the Special Committee

1. The Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of
the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples
was established by the General Assembly pursuant to its resolution 1654 (XVI) of
27 November 1961. The Special Committee was requested to examine the
application of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples, contained in Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14
December 1960, and to make suggestions and recommendations on the progress and
extent of the implementation of the Declaration.

2. At its seventeenth session, after considering the report of the Special
Committee,1 the General Assembly adopted resolution 1810 (XVII) of 17 December
1962, by which it enlarged the Special Committee with the addition of seven new
members. It invited the Special Committee “to continue to seek the most suitable
ways and means for the speedy and total application of the Declaration to all
Territories which have not yet attained independence”.

3. At the same session, by its resolution 1805 (XVII) of 14 December 1962 on
the question of South West Africa, the General Assembly requested the Special
Committee to discharge, mutatis mutandis, the tasks assigned to the Special
Committee for South West Africa by resolution 1702 (XVI) of 19 December 1961.
By its resolution 1806 (XVII) of 14 December 1962, the Assembly decided to
dissolve the Special Committee for South West Africa.

4. At its eighteenth session, by resolution 1970 (XVIII) of 16 December 1963, the
General Assembly decided to dissolve the Committee on Information from Non-
Self-Governing Territories and requested the Special Committee to study the
information transmitted under Article 73 e of the Charter of the United Nations. It
also requested the Special Committee to take that information fully into account in
examining the situation with regard to the implementation of the Declaration in each
of the Non-Self-Governing Territories and to undertake any special study and
prepare any special report it might consider necessary.

5. At the same session and at each subsequent session, the General Assembly,
after considering the report of the Special Committee,2 has adopted a resolution
renewing the mandate of the Special Committee.

6. On the occasion of the tenth, twentieth, twenty-fifth and thirtieth anniversaries
of the Declaration, the General Assembly, by approving the related reports of the
Special Committee, adopted resolutions 2621 (XXV) of 12 October 1970, 35/118 of

implementation of the Declaration.

7. At its forty-sixth session, the General Assembly, by adopting resolution 46/181
of 19 December 1991, endorsed as a plan of action for the International Decade for
the Eradication of Colonialism the proposals contained in the annex to the report of
the Secretary-General dated 13 December 1991 (A/46/634/Rev.1 and Corr.1). The
plan, inter alia, contained the following provisions:

“22. The Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the
Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to
Colonial Countries and Peoples, with the cooperation of the administering
Powers, should:

“(a) Prepare periodic analyses of the progress and extent of the
implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to
Colonial Countries and Peoples in each Territory;

“(b) Review the impact of the economic and social situation on the
constitutional and political advancement of Non-Self-Governing Territories;

“(c) Organize during the Decade seminars in the Caribbean and Pacific
regions alternately, as well as at United Nations Headquarters, to review the
progress achieved in the implementation of the plan of action, with the
participation of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, their
elected representatives, the administering Powers, Member States, regional
organizations, specialized agencies, non-governmental organizations and
experts.

“23. The Special Committee should continue to seek, as a matter of
priority, the full cooperation of administering Powers with regard to the
dispatch of United Nations visiting missions to Non-Self-Governing
Territories.

“24. The Special Committee, with the cooperation of the administering
Powers, should make every effort to facilitate and encourage the participation
of representatives of Non-Self-Governing Territories in regional and
international organizations, as well as in the specialized agencies of the United
Nations system, the Special Committee itself and other United Nations
decolonization bodies.”

8. At its fifty-fifth session, the General Assembly adopted resolution 55/146 of 8
December 2000, declaring the period 2001-2010 the Second International Decade
for the Eradication of Colonialism, and called upon Member States to redouble their
efforts to implement the plan of action, as contained in the annex to the report of the
Secretary-General dated 13 December 1991 (A/46/634/Rev.1 and Corr.1), updated
where necessary, to serve as the plan of action for the Second Decade. The updated
plan of action is contained in the annex to the report of the Secretary-General
(A/56/61).

those actions approved by the General Assembly regarding the International
Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism and the Second International

and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session;

“(b) To continue to examine the implementation by Member States of
resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant resolutions on decolonization;

General Assembly the most suitable steps to be taken to enable the populations
of those Territories to exercise their right to self-determination, including
independence;

“(d) To finalize before the end of 2002 a constructive programme of

37. The text of resolution A/AC.109/2002/22, adopted by the Special Committee
at its 6th meeting, on 10 June 2002, appears below:

The Special Committee,

Bearing in mind the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples, contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14
December 1960, as well as the resolutions and decisions of the Special Committee
concerning Puerto Rico,

Considering that the decade of the 1990s was proclaimed by the General
Assembly, in its resolution 43/47 of 22 November 1988, as the Decade for the
Eradication of Colonialism, and that by resolution 55/146 of 8 December 2000, the
General Assembly declared the period 2001-2010 the Second International Decade
for the Eradication of Colonialism,

Bearing in mind the 20 resolutions and decisions adopted by the Special
Committee on the question of Puerto Rico, contained in the reports of the Special
Committee to the General Assembly,

Recalling that 25 July 2002 marks the one hundred and fourth anniversary of
the intervention in Puerto Rico by the United States of America,

Also recalling the diverse initiatives taken by the political representatives of
Puerto Rico and the United States in recent years, which have thus far failed to set in
motion the process of decolonization of Puerto Rico,

Stressing the need for the United States to lay the groundwork for the full
implementation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and the resolutions and
decisions of the Special Committee concerning Puerto Rico,



11

A/57/23

Taking into account the measures recently adopted by both Chambers of the
Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico recommending the convening of a Status
Assembly of the people of Puerto Rico as part of the search for procedures that
would make it possible to launch the process of decolonization of Puerto Rico,

Aware that Vieques Island, Puerto Rico, has been used for over 60 years by the
United States Marines to carry out military manoeuvres, thereby limiting access by
the civilian population to an area equivalent to barely a quarter of the island, with
negative consequences for the health of the population, the environment and the
economic and social development of the Territory,

Regretting that the Government of the United States continues its military
manoeuvres and bombings on Vieques Island, which is inhabited, removing and
incarcerating hundreds of peaceful demonstrators, including political figures, and
imposing further restrictions on the civilian population,

Noting the intention expressed by the President of the United States to put an
end to the military manoeuvres on Vieques by 1 May 2003 or earlier,

Further noting the consensus among the people as well as within the
Government of Puerto Rico on the urgency of halting the military manoeuvres on
Vieques Island and on the return of the occupied land to the people of Puerto Rico,

Bearing in mind that an official referendum called by the Government of
Puerto Rico on 29 July 2001 showed that an overwhelming majority of the people of
Vieques are in favour of an immediate, permanent halt to military manoeuvres on
Vieques,

Noting the consensus among the people of Puerto Rico in favour of the release
of all Puerto Rican political prisoners who are serving sentences in United States
prisons for cases related to Puerto Rico’s independence,

Recalling the release of 11 Puerto Rican political prisoners in 2000,

Noting that the final document of the Thirteenth Ministerial Conference of the
Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Cartagena (Colombia) on 8 and 9
April 2000,8 the final communiqué of the Meeting of the Ministers for Foreign
Affairs and Heads of Delegation of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in New York
on 14 November 2001,9 and the final communiqué of the Ministerial Meeting of the
Coordinating Bureau of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Durban
(South Africa) from 27 to 29 April 2002, reaffirm the right of the people of Puerto
Rico to self-determination and independence on the basis of General Assembly
resolution 1514 (XV) and request the Special Committee to continue actively
pursuing the issue of Puerto Rico,

Having heard statements and testimonies representative of various viewpoints
among the people of Puerto Rico and their social institutions,

Having considered the report of the Rapporteur of the Special Committee on
the implementation of the resolutions concerning Puerto Rico,10

A/57/23

1. Reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of Puerto Rico to self-
determination and independence in conformity with General Assembly resolution
1514 (XV) and the applicability of the fundamental principles of that resolution to
the question of Puerto Rico;

2. Reiterates that the Puerto Rican people constitute a Latin American and
Caribbean nation that has its own unequivocal national identity;

3. Calls upon the Government of the United States of America to assume its
responsibility of expediting a process that will allow the Puerto Rican people fully
to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence, in
conformity with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and the resolutions and
decisions of the Special Committee concerning Puerto Rico;

4. Notes with satisfaction that, in recent years, progress has been achieved
towards the implementation of a mechanism that would ensure the full participation
of representatives of all viewpoints prevailing in Puerto Rico, such as the proposals
to convene a status Assembly of the people of Puerto Rico;

5. Reiterates the hope that the General Assembly will give comprehensive
consideration to the question of Puerto Rico in all its aspects;

6. Urges the Government of the United States, in line with the need to
guarantee the Puerto Rican people their legitimate right to self-determination and
the protection of their human rights, to order an immediate halt to its armed forces’
military drills and manoeuvres on Vieques Island, which is inhabited, return the
occupied land to the people of Puerto Rico, halt the persecution, incarceration,
arrests and harassment of peaceful demonstrators, immediately release all persons
incarcerated in this connection, respect fundamental human rights, such as the right
to health and economic development, and decontaminate the impact areas;

7. Requests the President of the United States of America to release all
Puerto Rican political prisoners serving sentences in United States prisons for cases
related to the struggle for the independence of Puerto Rico;

8. Notes with satisfaction the report prepared by the Rapporteur of the
Special Committee,10 in compliance with its resolution of 21 June 2001;

9. Requests the Rapporteur to report to the Special Committee in 2003 on
the implementation of the present resolution;

10. Decides to keep the question of Puerto Rico under continuous review.

F. Consideration of other matters

1. Matters relating to the small Territories

38. At its 1st meeting, on 12 February 2002, by adopting the suggestions relating
to the organization of its work put forward by the Chairman (A/AC.109/2002/L.2)
the Special Committee decided to include in its agenda the item entitled “Matters
relating to the small Territories” and to consider it at its plenary meetings.

39. In taking those decisions, the Special Committee took into account the
provisions of the relevant General Assembly resolutions, including resolution 56/74,
in paragraph 8 (c) of which the Assembly requested the Special Committee to



13

A/57/23

continue to pay special attention to the small Territories, in particular through the
dispatch of regular visiting missions, and to recommend to the Assembly the most
suitable steps to be taken to enable the populations of those Territories to exercise
their right to self-determination, including independence.

40. During the year, the Special Committee gave extensive consideration to all
phases of the situation obtaining in the small Territories (see chaps. X-XII).

2. Compliance of Member States with the Declaration and other resolutions on
decolonization

41. At its 1st meeting, on 12 February 2002, by adopting the suggestions relating
to the organization of its work put forward by the Chairman (A/AC.109/2002/L.2)
the Special Committee decided to consider in plenary meetings the question of
compliance of Member States with the Declaration and other relevant resolutions on
decolonization.

42. The Special Committee took that decision into account in its consideration of
specific items.

3. Question of holding a series of meetings away from Headquarters

43. At its 1st meeting, on 12 February 2002, by adopting the suggestions relating
to the organization of its work put forward by the Chairman (A/AC.109/2002/L.2)
the Special Committee decided to take up the question of holding a series of
meetings away from Headquarters as appropriate.

44. Having regard to its programme of work for 2003, the Special Committee, at
its 10th meeting, on 26 June 2002, considered the question of holding meetings
away from Headquarters, taking into account the provisions of paragraph 6 of
General Assembly resolution 1654 (XVI) of 27 November 1961 and paragraph 3 (9)
of resolution 2621 (XXV) of 12 October 1970, by which the Assembly authorized
the Special Committee to meet elsewhere than at United Nations Headquarters
whenever and wherever such meetings might be required for the effective discharge
of its functions. At the same meeting, the Special Committee decided that it would
consider accepting such invitations as might be received in 2003 and that, when
particulars of such meetings had become known, it would request the Secretary-
General to seek the necessary budgetary provision in accordance with established
procedure (see A/AC.109/2002/L.16, paras. 2 and 3).

4. Pattern of conferences

45. At its 1st meeting, on 12 February 2002, by adopting the suggestions relating
to the organization of its work put forward by the Chairman (A/AC.109/2002/L.2)
the Special Committee decided to take up as appropriate the item entitled “Pattern of
conferences”. In so doing, the Special Committee was conscious of the fact that it
had initiated some important measures in rationalizing its work methods, many of
which were subsequently incorporated in a number of resolutions and decisions of
the General Assembly. Further recalling the measures it had taken theretofore in that
connection, the Special Committee decided to continue to exercise its initiatives in
the effective utilization of the limited conference resources and the further reduction
of its documentation requirements.



14

A/57/23

46. The Special Committee also continued the practice of circulating
communications and information material, as far as possible, in the form of informal
notes and aides-memoires in the original language of submission, thus curtailing
documentation requirements and accruing considerable savings for the Organization.
A list of the documents issued by the Special Committee in 2002 is contained in the
annex to the present chapter.

47. At its 10th meeting, on 26 June 2002, the Special Committee considered the
item and noted that, during the year, it had closely followed the guidelines set forth
in the resolutions of the General Assembly on the pattern of conferences, in
particular resolution 56//242 of 24 December 2001. By organizing its programme of
work effectively and holding extensive consultations, the Committee strived to keep
the number of its formal meetings to a minimum. The Special Committee decided,
taking into account its probable workload for 2003, to consider holding its meetings
in accordance with the following schedule:

(a) Plenary

February/March As required

June/July Up to 30 meetings

(6-8 meetings a week)

(b) Bureau

February/July 20 meetings

It was understood that that programme would not preclude the holding of any ad hoc
meetings that might be warranted and that the Special Committee might, in early
2003, review the scheduled meetings on the basis of any new developments. The
Special Committee decided, subject to any directives given by the General
Assembly, to strive, while fulfilling its mandate, to keep its meetings to a minimum
(see A/AC.109/2002/L.16, paras. 5-7).

5. Control and limitation of documentation

48. At its 10th meeting, on 26 June 2002, the Special Committee considered the
question of the control and limitation of documentation and noted that, during the
year, it had taken further measures to control and limit its documentation in
compliance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, in particular
resolutions 34/50 of 23 November 1979, 39/68 D of 13 December 1984, 51/211 B of
18 December 1996 and 56/242 of 24 December 2001. The Special Committee noted
that, in its resolution 50/206 B of 23 December 1995, the General Assembly had
approved the recommendation of the Special Committee to replace its verbatim
records by summary records. Having reviewed the need for such records, the Special
Committee decided to maintain its summary records (see A/AC.109/2002/L.16,
paras. 8 and 9).

6. Cooperation and participation of the administering Powers in the work of
the Special Committee

49. In compliance with the provisions of the relevant resolutions of the General
Assembly, the delegation of New Zealand, as the administering Power, continued to



15

A/57/23

participate, in accordance with established procedure, in the related work of the
Special Committee (see chap. XI).

50. The delegation of France participated in the work of the Special Committee
during its consideration of the question of New Caledonia (see chap. IX).

51. The delegations of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and the United States of America did not participate in the work of the Special
Committee.11 However, during informal consultations with the Special Committee
held in June 2002, both administering Powers expressed their desire to continue
informal dialogue with the Special Committee (see sects. I and J of the present
chapter). The representative of the United Kingdom participated in the Pacific
regional seminar held at Nadi, Fiji, from 14 to 16 May 2002 (see chap. II, annex).

52. In a related context, the Special Committee, at its 7th meeting, on 3 June 2002,
adopted resolution A/AC.109/2002/21 on the question of sending visiting missions
to Territories. By that resolution, the Special Committee noted with appreciation
that, at the invitation of the Government of New Zealand, a visiting mission had
been dispatched to Tokelau in July 1994. It called upon the administering Powers to
cooperate or continue to cooperate with the United Nations by receiving United
Nations visiting missions in the Territories under their administration (see para.
127).

53. Furthermore, at its 10th meeting, on 26 June 2002, the Special Committee
considered an invitation to dispatch a visiting mission to Tokelau extended by New
Zealand, the administering Power of that Territory. The Special Committee accepted
the invitation and decided to dispatch a visiting mission to Tokelau during the month
of August 2002 (see chaps. IV and XI).

7. Participation of representatives of Non-Self-Governing Territories in the work of
the Special Committee

54. At its 10th meeting, on 26 June 2002, the Special Committee considered the
question of the participation of representatives of Non-Self-Governing Territories in
its work and decided that the participation of representatives of Non-Self-Governing
Territories in the work of the Special Committee at Headquarters, as recommended
in the Plan of Action for the Second International Decade for the Eradication of
Colonialism (A/56/61, annex), should continue to be facilitated through the
reimbursement by the United Nations of the expenses relating to their participation
under the terms of the guidelines amended by the Committee and approved by the
General Assembly at its forty-eighth session (see A/AC.109/L.1791, annex, and
A/AC.109/L.1804). In that regard, the Special Committee decided to consider the
guidelines at its plenary meetings with a view to amending them further, where
appropriate (see A/AC.109/2002/L.16, para. 13).

8. Week of Solidarity with the Peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories

55. Information on the Week of Solidarity with the Peoples of Non-Self-Governing
Territories is contained in chapter II, annex, paragraphs 16, 18 and 20 and
appendices III and V, and in chapter III, paragraph 118.

9. Representation at seminars, meetings and conferences of intergovernmental and
other organizations

56. At its 10th meeting, on 26 June 2002, the Special Committee decided to
recommend to the General Assembly that the Committee continue to be represented
at seminars, meetings and conferences organized by United Nations bodies and other
intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations active in the field of
decolonization. In keeping with its decision of 12 February 2002, the Committee
would authorize its Chairman to hold consultations, as appropriate, concerning its
participation in those meetings, as well as the level of representation, when
accepting invitations. In accordance with established practice and on the basis of the
principle of rotation, the Chairman would hold consultations with the Bureau
members who, in turn, would consult with the members of the Committee from their
respective regional groups. The Special Committee also decided that the Chairman
would also have consultations with those members of the Committee whose regional
group was not represented in the Bureau. It also decided to recommend that the
General Assembly make appropriate budgetary provisions to cover such activities in
2003 (see A/AC.109/2002/L.16, para. 4).

10. Report of the Special Committee to the General Assembly

57. At its 1st meeting, on 12 February 2002, by adopting the suggestions relating
to the organization of its work put forward by the Chairman (A/AC.109/2002/L.2),
and in accordance with paragraph 31 of General Assembly decision 34/401 on the
rationalization of the procedures and organization of the Assembly, the Special
Committee decided to follow the procedure adopted at its 2001 session12 in
connection with the formulation of its recommendations to the Assembly at its fifty-
seventh session.

58. At its 10th meeting, on 26 June 2002, with reference to its decision taken at the
3rd meeting, on 3 June 2002, the Special Committee, on the proposal of the
Chairman, authorized the Rapporteur to reformulate the Committee’s draft
resolutions and decisions into the format of the General Assembly and to submit
directly to the Assembly various chapters of the report in accordance with
established practice and procedure.

11. Other questions

59. At its 1st meeting, on 12 February 2002, by adopting the suggestions relating
to the organization of its work put forward by the Chairman (A/AC.109/2002/L.2)
the Special Committee decided, in its examination of specific Territories, to take
into account the relevant provisions of General Assembly resolutions and decisions
listed in the note by the Secretary-General on the organization of work of the
Special Committee (A/AC.109/2002/L.1, para. 11). That decision was taken into
account during the consideration of specific Territories and other items in plenary
meetings.

at its fifty-eighth session, in 2002, including resolutions on the question of Western
Sahara (2002/4), the question of the realization in all countries of the economic,

63. During the year, having regard to the relevant provisions of the International
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Special
Committee continued to follow the work of the Committee on the Elimination of
Racial Discrimination (see also paras. 71 and 72 below).

4. Specialized agencies and international institutions associated with the
United Nations

64. In accordance with the requests contained in the relevant General Assembly
resolutions, the Special Committee continued its consideration of the question of the



18

A/57/23

implementation of the Declaration by the specialized agencies and the international
institutions associated with the United Nations (see also para. 60 above). An account
of the Special Committee’s consideration of the question is set out in chapter VII of
the present report (see A/57/23 (Part II)).

65. During the year, the Special Committee adopted decisions relating to the
extension of assistance to the peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Those
decisions are reflected in recommendations of the Special Committee to the General
Assembly (see A/57/23 (Part III), chap. XIII).

5. Organization of African Unity

66. Bearing in mind its previous decisions to maintain contact with the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) on a regular basis in order to assist in the
effective discharge of its mandate, the Special Committee, as in previous years,
closely followed the work of OAU.

6. Caribbean Community

67. Bearing in mind its previous decisions to maintain contact with the Caribbean
Community (CARICOM) on a regular basis in order to assist in the effective
discharge of its mandate, the Special Committee, as in previous years, closely
followed the work of CARICOM.

7. Pacific Islands Forum

68. The Special Committee continued to follow closely the work of the Pacific
Islands Forum concerning the Non-Self-Governing Territories in the south Pacific
region.

8. Movement of Non-Aligned Countries

69. The Special Committee continued to follow closely the work of the Movement
of the Non-Aligned Countries regarding the issue of decolonization.

9. Non-governmental organizations

70. Having regard to the relevant provisions of General Assembly resolutions
56/73 and 56/74, the Special Committee continued to follow closely the activities of
non-governmental organizations having a special interest in the field of
decolonization. The participation of non-governmental organizations in the work of
the Special Committee during the period under review is covered in detail in the
Special Committee documents (see A/AC.109/2002/19) and the present report (see
para. 31 above and chap. II, annex, below). The related decisions of the Special
Committee are listed in chapter XIII of the present report.

H. Action relating to international conventions/studies/programmes

1. International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
Discrimination

71. At its 1st meeting, on 12 February 2002, by adopting the suggestions relating
to the organization of its work put forward by the Chairman (A/AC.109/2002/L.2),



19

A/57/23

the Special Committee decided to include in the agenda of its 2002 session an item
entitled “International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
Discrimination” and to consider it at its plenary meetings.

72. The Special Committee continued to monitor related developments in the
Territories, having regard to the relevant provisions of article 15 of the International
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (General
Assembly resolution 2106 A (XX), annex).

2. Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination

73. The Special Committee continued to take into account the provisions of the
relevant resolutions of the United Nations bodies concerned relating to the Third
Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination.

I. Review of work

74. As noted elsewhere in the present report, the reform processes initiated by the
Special Committee in 1991, which brought about a number of changes and
improvements in its approach, methods and procedures, continued to be actively
pursued in 2002. The measures adopted by the Special Committee included the
streamlining and consolidation of a number of its resolutions. With regard to the
preparation of the consolidated draft resolution, the Special Committee held
extensive informal consultations with the administering Powers concerned and other
States as well as with the representatives of Non-Self-Governing Territories. The
Special Committee’s recommendation to the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh
session on 12 Territories was consolidated into two resolutions (A/AC.109/2002/24
and A/AC.109/2002/30; see chap. XIII, sects. E and F).

75. The Special Committee also reviewed its resolutions on information from Non-
Self-Governing Territories transmitted under Article 73 e of the Charter of the
United Nations (A/AC.109/2001/20), the question of sending visiting missions to
Territories (A/AC.109/2002/21), implementation of the Declaration by the
specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United
Nations (A/AC.109/2002/26) and economic and other activities which affect the
interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories (A/AC.109/2002/28),
as well as its decision on military activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in
Territories under their administration (A/AC.109/2002/29).

76. As noted in chapter II of the present report, the Special Committee held a
Pacific regional seminar at Nadi, Fiji, from 14 to 16 May 2002 in implementation of
the Plan of Action for the Second International Decade for the Eradication of
Colonialism referred to in General Assembly resolution 55/146 of 8 December 2000.

77. In accordance with the mandate entrusted to it by the General Assembly, the
Special Committee continued to seek suitable means for the implementation of
resolution 1514 (XV) in all Territories to which the Declaration is applicable and
formulated specific proposals and recommendations in that regard.

78. On the question of the publicity to be given to the work of the United Nations
in the field of decolonization, the Special Committee adopted a resolution
(A/AC.109/2002/20) which it recommends to the General Assembly for action at its
fifty-seventh session (see chap. XIII, sect. G).



20

A/57/23

79. The Special Committee also continued its review of the list of Territories to
which the Declaration is applicable. With regard to its decision of 21 June 2001
concerning Puerto Rico, the Special Committee heard a number of representatives of
organizations concerned and adopted a resolution on the matter
(A/AC.109/2002/22), which is set out in paragraph 37.

80. During the period under review, the Special Committee continued the critical
review of its work and its programme of future work by holding a number of
informal meetings. The Special Committee continued discussion on the case-by-case
work programmes for each of the Non-Self-Governing Territories within the
framework of the informal Working Group on the Programme of Work for the Non-
Self-Governing Territories (see paras. 28 above) and held informal consultations on
the matter with the administering Powers concerned with a view to improving
cooperation between the Committee and the administering Powers (see sect. J
below).

81. In accordance with the guidelines established by the General Assembly, the
Special Committee was able during the year to reduce the number of its formal
meetings and to minimize the wastage resulting from cancellation of scheduled
meetings.

J. Future work

82. In accordance with the mandate entrusted to it by the General Assembly since
1961 and subject to further directives from the Assembly at its fifty-seventh session,
the Special Committee intends to continue during 2003 to pursue its efforts in
bringing to a speedy and unconditional end to colonialism in all its forms and
manifestations, in accordance with Article 73 of the Charter and the Declaration on
the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.

83. The Second International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism provides
an important political framework for continued and strengthened efforts to advance
the decolonization agenda of the United Nations.

84. In 2003, the Special Committee intends to continue and intensify its dialogue
and cooperation with the administering Powers for the purpose of furthering the
cause of decolonization through the development of programmes of work for the
decolonization of specific Territories as agreed in 2000 and 2001. Basic working
documentation and reference material for this purpose have been prepared and
distributed, on an informal basis, with the concerned Member States and Non-Self-
Governing Territories. In this connection, the Special Committee prepared in 2000 a
non-paper containing a generic programme of work outlining objectives, activities,
outcomes and target or key dates. Furthermore, working papers submitted by
members of the Special Committee (A/AC.109/1999/20 and A/AC.109/1999/21) on
the conceptual framework for the review of progress in the implementation of the
1960 Declaration have enriched the Special Committee’s discussions. In accordance
with agreements reached with the administering Powers concerned, they will ensure
the participation of representatives of the Territories at every stage of discussions.
The Special Committee will continue to exercise flexibility in working jointly with
the administering Power and the representatives of the Territories in developing
work programmes for American Samoa, Pitcairn and Tokelau respectively. The
members of the Special Committee were particularly encouraged by the fruitful



21

A/57/23

meetings held in June 2001 and 2002 with the representatives of New Zealand and
Tokelau regarding progress made in the process towards self-determination in this
Territory. An initial draft programme of work was prepared as a result of these
discussions. In the coming year, the Special Committee will continue its
consultations with the administering Power and the representatives of Tokelau as it
follows further advances in the Territory within the framework of the work
programme for the decolonization of Tokelau.

85. In order to discharge its responsibilities, the Special Committee will keep the
situation in the Territories under continuous review, examining the impact of
developments concerning each Territory on their political advancement. It will also
review the compliance by Member States, particularly the administering Powers,
with the relevant decisions and resolutions of the United Nations.

86. The Special Committee will continue to submit conclusions and
recommendations on the specific measures necessary to achieve the objectives set
out in the Declaration and the relevant provisions of the Charter. The Special
Committee also intends to continue its review of the list of Territories to which the
Declaration is applicable.

87. The Special Committee will continue to fulfil the responsibilities that have
been entrusted to it in the context of the Second International Decade for the
Eradication of Colonialism, declared by the General Assembly in its resolution
55/146 and particularly with regard to the implementation of the Plan of Action
contained in document A/56/61. The Special Committee has been greatly
encouraged by the growing interest and participation of the people in the Non-Self-
Governing Territories in the regional seminars it conducts annually and by the wider
participation of Member States, specialized agencies and programmes, non-
governmental organizations and experts. In this regard, the Special Committee will
continue to conduct these seminars, for the purpose of assessing, receiving and
disseminating information on the situation in the Territories, in order to facilitate
implementation of its mandate. It will also continue to disseminate information on
the work of the Special Committee. In this connection, the Special Committee will
hold a seminar in the Caribbean region in 2003.

88. The Special Committee will continue to seek the views of the representatives
of the Non-Self-Governing Territories and in that regard will seek the
implementation of General Assembly resolutions calling upon the administering
Powers to cooperate or to continue to cooperate with the Special Committee by
inviting United Nations visiting missions to the Territories under their
administration. Having regard to the constructive role played by such missions in
the past, the Special Committee continues to attach the utmost importance to the
dispatch of visiting missions as a means of collecting adequate and first-hand
information on conditions in the Territories and on the wishes and aspirations of the
peoples concerning their future status. Accordingly, the Special Committee will
continue to seek the full cooperation of the administering Powers in facilitating the
implementation of the Special Committee’s mandate for visiting missions,
particularly in the context of developing work programmes for specific Territories
and in support of the decolonization process in those Territories.

89. The Special Committee will continue to pay special attention to the specific
problems of the small island Territories, which constitute the overwhelming majority
of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories. The Special Committee is aware



22

A/57/23

that, in addition to general problems facing developing countries, those island
Territories also suffer handicaps arising from the interplay of such factors as size,
remoteness, geographical dispersion, vulnerability to natural disasters, fragility of
ecosystems, constraints in transport and communications, great distances from
market centres, a highly limited internal market, lack of natural resources, weak
indigenous technological capacity, the acute problem of obtaining freshwater
supplies, heavy dependence on imports and a small number of commodities,
depletion of non-renewable resources, migration, particularly of individuals with
high-level skills, shortage of administrative personnel and heavy financial burdens.
The Special Committee will continue to recommend measures to facilitate a
sustained and balanced growth of the fragile economies of those Territories and
increased assistance in the development of all the sectors of their economies, with
particular emphasis on programmes of diversification. The Special Committee
believes that issues facing the Non-Self-Governing Territories, such as
environmental problems; the impact of hurricanes, volcanoes and other natural
disasters, beach and coastal erosion and drought; finding ways and means to fight
drug trafficking, money-laundering and other illegal and criminal activities; and the
illegal exploitation of the marine resources of the Territories and the need to utilize
those resources for the benefit of their peoples, should remain the focus of its
attention. In so doing, the Special Committee will continue to take into
consideration the recommendations of the regional seminars that it has organized
since 1990.13

90. It is the intention of the Special Committee to continue to follow closely the
implementation of the Declaration by the specialized agencies and the international
institutions associated with the United Nations. In so doing, the Special Committee,
as in the past, will review the actions taken or envisaged by international
organizations in the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the General
Assembly. The Special Committee will hold further consultations and contacts with
those organizations, as appropriate. It will also be guided by the results of
consultations held in 2002 between its Chairman and the President of the Economic
and Social Council in the context of the relevant decisions of the Assembly, the
Council and the Special Committee itself. Furthermore, the Special Committee will
maintain close contact with the secretaries-general and senior officials of regional
organizations, such as OAU, OAS, CARICOM and the Pacific Islands Forum,
particularly those in the Caribbean and Pacific regions. The objective of those
contacts is to facilitate the effective implementation of the decisions of the various
United Nations bodies and to foster cooperation between the specialized agencies
and the regional organizations in providing assistance for the Non-Self-Governing
Territories in a given region.

91. The Special Committee will also strive to follow up on the General Assembly’s
request that the participation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories in the work of
relevant meetings and conferences of the agencies and organizations be facilitated so
that the Territories can benefit from the related activities of the specialized agencies

and other organizations of the United Nations system. Such participation would
constitute an effective means of promoting the progress of the peoples of those
Territories, enabling them to enhance their standard of living and achieve greater
self-sufficiency.

92. The Special Committee intends to take into account the agreement reached
with the European Union on economic and other activities which affect the interests
of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories (A/AC.109/2002/28) and to
continue its cooperation with interested States to ensure that the interests of the
peoples of those Territories are protected. The Special Committee will continue its
study of military activities and arrangements in the Territories and will also
cooperate with interested States in that regard.

93. Taking into consideration its mandate on Western Sahara and its primary
responsibility to ensure the implementation of General Assembly resolution 1514
(XV) for all Non-Self-Governing Territories, and in accordance with a decision it
had taken at its 1397th meeting, on 23 August 1991, the Special Committee may
dispatch a mission to Western Sahara during the holding of the referendum in the
Territory.

94. Taking into account the views expressed by the representatives of the
remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories at the regional seminars organized by the
Special Committee since 1990, as well as the recommendations contained in the
Plan of Action for the Second International Decade for the Eradication of
Colonialism, the Special Committee will continue to consider, in cooperation with
the administering Powers, how to intensify and improve the participation of the
representatives of those Territories in the work of the Special Committee within
existing resources.

95. In the light of the provisions of the General Assembly resolutions concerning
the pattern of conferences and taking into consideration its experience in previous
years as well as its probable workload for 2003, the Special Committee has
approved a tentative programme of meetings for 2003, which it commends to the
Assembly for approval.

96. The Special Committee has consistently reiterated the importance of
disseminating information on decolonization as an instrument for furthering the
aims of the Declaration. Accordingly, the Special Committee will continue to use
opportunities such as the regional seminars and the observance of the Week of
Solidarity with the Peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories to disseminate
information on its activities and on the Territories in an effort to mobilize world
public opinion to support and assist the people of the Territories in bringing about
the speedy and unconditional end of colonialism in all its forms and manifestations.

97. The Special Committee suggests that, when the General Assembly, at its fifty-
seventh session, examines the question of the implementation of the Declaration, it
may wish to take into account the various recommendations of the Special
Committee that are reflected in the relevant chapters of the present report and, in
particular, to endorse the proposals outlined in the present section in order to enable
the Special Committee to carry out the tasks it envisages for 2003. The Special
Committee recommends that the Assembly renew its appeal to the administering
Powers to take all necessary steps for the implementation of the Declaration and the
relevant United Nations resolutions, in accordance with the freely expressed wishes



24

A/57/23

of the peoples of the Territories concerned. In that connection, the Special
Committee recommends that the Assembly request all the administering Powers to
become involved with the work of the Special Committee in the discharge of its
mandate and, in particular, to participate actively in the work relating to the
Territories under their respective administrations. The Special Committee also
recommends that the Assembly continue to invite the administering Powers to allow
representatives of the Territories concerned to participate in the discussions in the
Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) and the Special
Committee on the items relating to their respective Territories. Furthermore, the
Assembly might also wish to renew its appeal to all States, the specialized agencies
and other organizations of the United Nations system to comply with the various
requests addressed to them by the Assembly and the Security Council in their
relevant resolutions.

98. The Special Committee recommends that, in approving the programme of work
outlined above, the General Assembly make adequate provision to cover the
activities that the Special Committee envisages for 2003. In that regard, the Special
Committee recalls that the programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003 includes
resources to provide for the programme of work of the Special Committee for 2002-
2003 based on the level of activities approved for 2001, without prejudice to the
decisions to be taken by the Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. On that basis, the
Special Committee understands that, should any additional provisions be required
over and above those included in the proposed programme budget for the biennium
2002-2003, proposals for supplementary requirements would be made to the General
Assembly for its approval. Finally, the Special Committee expresses the hope that
the Secretary-General will continue to provide it with all the facilities and personnel
necessary for the discharge of its mandate, taking into account the various tasks
assigned to it by the Assembly as well as those arising from decisions taken by it
during the current year.

K. Conclusion of the 2002 session

99. At its 10th meeting, on 26 June 2002, the Special Committee decided to
authorize its Rapporteur to prepare and submit directly to the General Assembly the
various chapters of the report of the Special Committee in accordance with
established practice and procedure.

100. At the same meeting, the Chairman made a statement on the occasion of the
closing of the 2002 session of the Special Committee (see A/AC.109/2002/SR.10)
with the understanding that the Special Committee might hold an additional meeting
at a later stage to consider the report of the United Nations visiting mission to
Tokelau.

101. On 19 December 1991, at its forty-sixth session, the General Assembly
adopted resolution 46/181, entitled “International Decade for the Eradication of
Colonialism”, and the Plan of Action contained in the annex to the report of the
Secretary-General dated 13 December 1991 (A/46/634/Rev.1 and Corr.1). In the
Plan of Action, “aimed at ushering in, in the twenty-first century, a world free from
colonialism”, the Assembly, inter alia, requested the Special Committee:

“[to] organize during the Decade seminars in the Caribbean and Pacific regions
alternately, as well as at United Nations Headquarters, to review the progress
achieved in the implementation of the plan of action, with the participation of
the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, their elected
representatives, the administering Powers, Member States, regional
organizations, specialized agencies, non-governmental organizations and
experts.”

102. At its fifty-fifth session, the General Assembly adopted resolution 55/146 of 8
December 2000, declaring the period 2001-2010 the Second International Decade
for the Eradication of Colonialism, and called upon Member States to redouble their
efforts to implement the Plan of Action, as contained in the annex to the report of
the Secretary-General dated 13 December 1991, updated where necessary, to serve
as the Plan of Action for the Second Decade. The updated plan of action is
contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the Second Decade (A/56/61,
annex).

103. At its 1st and 2nd meetings, on 12 February and 28 March 2002, the Special
Committee, mindful of the mandate entrusted to it by the General Assembly in the
implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples, and by approving the recommendation of its Chairman on
the organization of work of the Special Committee for the year
(A/AC.109/2002/L.2), decided to allocate to plenary meetings of the Special
Committee, as appropriate, the question of the “Second International Decade for the
Eradication of Colonialism”.

104. The Special Committee considered the questions of the Second International
Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism and the Pacific Regional Seminar to
review the political, economic and social conditions in the small island Non-Self-
Governing Territories, held at Nadi, Fiji, from 14 to 16 May 2002, at its 1st, 2nd and
9th meetings, on 12 February, 28 March and 24 June 2002.

105. The Special Committee had before it the guidelines and rules of procedure for
the Pacific Regional Seminar (A/AC.109/2002/1).

106. At its 2nd meeting, on 28 March, following a statement by the Chairman, the
Special Committee approved the composition of the official delegation of the
Special Committee to the Pacific Regional Seminar (see A/AC.109/2002/SR.2).

107. The Special Committee also decided to invite United Nations organs, agencies
and institutions to apprise the Secretary-General of actions they had taken in
implementation of General Assembly resolution 55/146 of 8 December 2000 and to



30

A/57/23

submit a report to the Assembly at its fifty-eighth session, subject to any directives
that the Assembly might give at its fifty-seventh session in that regard (see
A/AC.109/2002/L.16).

108. At the 9th meeting, on 24 June 2002, the Chairman of the Special Committee
drew attention to the draft report of the Pacific Regional Seminar, which had been
circulated to members of the Special Committee as a conference room paper.

109. At the same meeting, the Rapporteur of the Special Committee introduced the
draft report of the Seminar, which contained a detailed account of the organization
and proceedings of the Seminar (see A/AC.109/2002/SR.9).

110. At the same meeting, following the statements made by the representatives of

Introduction

1. On 22 November 1988, the General Assembly adopted resolution 43/47 on the
International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, which read in part as
follows:

“The General Assembly,

“...

“1. Declares the period 1990-2000 as the International Decade for the
Eradication of Colonialism;

“2. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly
at its forty-fourth session a report that would enable the Assembly to consider
and adopt an action plan aimed at ushering in the twenty-first century, a world
free from colonialism.”

2. At its forty-sixth session, the General Assembly adopted resolution 46/181 of
19 December 1991 on the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism,
and the plan of action contained in the report of the Secretary-General
(A/46/634/Rev.1 and Corr.1) aimed at ushering in, in the twenty-first century, a
world free from colonialism. In the plan of action, the Assembly, inter alia,
requested the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation
of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples to organize during the Decade seminars in the Caribbean and Pacific regions
alternately, as well as at United Nations Headquarters, to review the progress
achieved in the implementation of the plan of action, with the participation of the
peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories,a their elected representatives, the
administering Powers, Member States, regional organizations, specialized agencies,
non-governmental organizations and experts.

3. In its resolution 46/70 of 11 December 1991 on cooperation and coordination
of specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United
Nations in their assistance to Non-Self-Governing Territories, the General Assembly
stated that:

“In addition to general problems facing developing countries, the
remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories, many of which are small island
Territories, also suffer handicaps arising from the interplay of such factors as
their size, remoteness, geographical dispersion, vulnerability to natural
disasters, the fragility of their ecosystems, constraints in transport and
communications, great distances from market centres, ... weak indigenous
technological capacity, the acute problem of obtaining freshwater supplies,
heavy dependence on imports and a small number of commodities, depletion of
non-renewable resources, migration, particularly of personnel with high-level
skills, shortage of administrative personnel and heavy financial burdens”.

__________________
a At present the list of Territories with which the Special Committee is concerned and to which

the Declaration is applicable includes American Samoa, Anguilla, Bermuda, British Virgin
Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands (Malvinas), Gibraltar, Guam, Montserrat, New

4. At its fifty-fifth session, the General Assembly adopted resolution 55/146 of 8
December 2000, declaring the period 2001-2010 the Second International Decade
for the Eradication of Colonialism, and called upon Member States to redouble their
efforts to implement the plan of action, as contained in the annex to the report of the
Secretary-General dated 13 December 1991 (see para. 2 above), updated where
necessary, to serve as the plan of action for the Second Decade. The report of the
Secretary-General on the Second International Decade for the Eradication of
Colonialism (A/56/61) contains an updated plan of action.

5. In its resolution 56/74 of 10 December 2001, the General Assembly approved
the report of the Special Committee,b which inter alia called for the holding of a
seminar in the Pacific region, to be organized by the Special Committee, in 2002.

6. As stated in the guidelines and rules of procedure for the Seminar
(A/AC.109/2002/1), the purpose of the Seminar was to assess the situation in the
Non-Self-Governing Territories, in particular their constitutional evolution towards
self-determination in order to facilitate the development by the Special Committee
of a constructive programme of work on a case-by-case basis for the Non-Self-
Governing Territories. The Seminar would also identify areas in which the
international community could increase and enhance its participation in programmes
of assistance and adopt a comprehensive and integrated approach to ensuring the
political and sustainable socio-economic development of the Territories concerned.

7. The topics considered by the Seminar will assist the Special Committee and
the participants in making an evaluation of the situation in the Non-Self-Governing
Territories. The Seminar gave pre-eminence to a broad range of views of the peoples
of those Territories. It also sought to secure the participation of organizations and
institutions that are actively involved in the political, economic and social
development of those Territories and of selected non-governmental organizations
with long and established experience in island Territories.

8. The contributions of the participants served as a basis for the conclusions and
recommendations of the Seminar, which will be carefully studied by the Special
Committee with a view to submitting proposals to the General Assembly concerning
the fulfilment of the objectives of the Second International Decade for the
Eradication of Colonialism.

Member States

24. The representative of Argentina stated that the question of the Falkland Islands
(Malvinas) differed from traditional colonial cases and constituted a special and
particular form of colonialism that affected the territorial integrity of the Argentine
Republic. He recalled that resolutions of the General Assembly and the Special
Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on
the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples recognized the
existence of a sovereignty dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom over
the Territory which should be solved through bilateral negotiations, bearing in mind
the interests of the population of the Islands. He stressed the position of his



37

Government that the existence of the sovereignty dispute ruled out the applicability
of the right to self-determination, since it would be unacceptable for British citizens
residing in the Territory to decide over a dispute to which their country is a party. He
also stated that Argentina had repeatedly expressed its determination to resume
negotiations with the United Kingdom and to respect the way of life and interests of
the inhabitants of the Islands as enshrined in the Argentine National Constitution.
He reiterated his Government’s disposition to discuss all schemes that could lead to
a final peaceful solution of the sovereignty dispute. Finally he stated that any
attempt by the Seminar to recognize any status of the Legislative Council of the
Islands would go against the principles and rules governing the work of the Special
Committee and the General Assembly resolutions related to the issue.

25. The representative of Grenada stated that there remained 16 Non-Self-
Governing Territories for which the Special Committee still had monitoring
responsibility, conferred to it by the General Assembly’s declaration of the period of
2001-2010 as the Second International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism in
its resolution 55/146 of 8 December 2000. In the same resolution, the Assembly had
called upon Member States to redouble their efforts to implement the plan of action
for the Second International Decade. The administering Powers, under terms of the
Charter, accepted as a “sacred trust” the obligation to promote the well-being of the
Territories under their administration and were duty-bound to transmit regularly to
the Secretary-General information relating to the economic, social and educational
conditions in the Territories, until such time as the Non-Self-Governing Territories
opted to exercise their right to self-determination, under article 2 of the Declaration
on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.

26. The representative of Indonesia stated that the emergence of independent and
sovereign countries from a large number of colonies, among them his own country
in the 1940s, lent great impetus to the process of decolonization. For its part,
Indonesia’s deep and abiding commitment to that objective emanated from the
preamble of its 1945 Constitution whereby the Government of Indonesia was to
“contribute to an order in the world based upon independence, abiding peace and
justice” and since then, it had been a constitutional duty to work towards that end.
More than four decades later, that message had been spread successfully as attested
to by the near universality of the membership of the United Nations, currently in its
fifty-sixth year. The world would soon welcome East Timor into the family of
nations. The people and the Government of Indonesia would join the East Timorese
in the historic celebrations on 20 May 2002 when East Timor would become a full-
fledged sovereign and independent nation and, thereafter, a State Member of the
United Nations. There remained 16 Non-Self-Governing Territories that had yet to
realize self-determination. However, it was essential that the work of the Special
Committee stay within the parameters of its mandate and that the Committee be
vigilant regarding the consideration of extraneous issues. It was his delegation’s
firm belief that the Seminar’s deliberations should be guided by that principle so
that the Committee would not be distracted from fulfilling its purpose. Therefore,
the Special Committee should be dedicated fully and only for advancing the
interests and aspirations of the inhabitants of the remaining 16 Non-Self-Governing
Territories. Any discussion of incongruent issues was unacceptable and would only
lead the Special Committee farther away from its mandated objective.

27. The representative of Morocco stated that, since the beginning of the dispute
between Morocco and Algeria on the matter of Western Sahara, his country had



38

A/57/23

demonstrated its preference and its determination for a peaceful solution, even
though it considered the recovery of its southern provinces crucial to achieving its
territorial integrity. His country, in a gesture of good will and conciliation, had
proposed the organization of a referendum on that part of its territory, which had
been occupied by Spain and recovered in conformity with international legality. He
noted that the only internationally registered claim to the Saharan territory was that
of Morocco and that the struggle for the liberation of the Sahara had been led by the
Moroccan Liberation Army in the 1950s. The Frente POLISARIO had been created
at the eve of the signature of the Madrid Accord, within a specific regional context.
Since the inception of that process, and despite the constant and positive
contribution of Morocco to overcome the difficulties hampering the implementation
of the Settlement Plan for the last 10 years and the willingness of his country to
launch a sincere dialogue with the separatists based on generally accepted
democratic norms, taking into account the specific features of the region and
meeting the needs of its population, Algeria and the Frente POLISARIO continued
to categorically reject any discussion on the search of any solution which would
guarantee peace and stability in the region. Given the persistent deadlock, the
Secretary-General concluded in his report to the Security Council in June 2001
(S/2001/613) that the settlement plan was inapplicable and expressed doubt that the
proposed referendum would be held. The Secretary-General also recommended the
extension of the mandate of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in
Western Sahara (MINURSO) to give his Personal Envoy time to conduct
consultations on the proposed framework agreement on the future status of Western
Sahara. He also pointed out that the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy
called upon the parties to engage in constructive consultations on the proposed
framework agreement, as it might be the last window of opportunity for years to
come. The representative of Morocco urged the Committee to always keep in mind
the humanitarian dimension of the problem, namely the fate and future of thousands
of refugees who had been forcibly displaced from their homes 25 years before and
who lived in precarious conditions in Tindouf camps in Algeria and had not been
allowed to return to their families. He concluded by saying that the draft framework
agreement constituted an opportunity to design the basis of a just, reasonable and
durable solution to the dispute, a political solution that would be based on respect
for Morocco’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

28. The representative of New Zealand traced how the United Nations and the
administering Power had adapted to a quite atypical decolonization context over the
quarter century since the first United Nations visiting mission in 1976. Both parties
had recognized in particular that Tokelau, in its special circumstances, had its own
pace. Today, a distinctively Tokelauan governance capacity was developing within
its structure based on traditional authority. The Territory’s participation in the
dialogue with the Special Committee’s Working Group in 2001 had given it a
positive feeling of being a participant in the decolonization process, not just an
adjunct to the administering Power and the United Nations. He concluded by saying
that Tokelau and New Zealand were embarking on an across-the-board review of
their relationship.

29. The representative of Spain reiterated that the negotiations between his country
and the United Kingdom within the Brussels process represented a fulfilment of the
repeated recommendations of the United Nations. In addition, the process was
welcomed and encouraged by the supreme institutions of the European Union and



39

A/57/23

was in full accordance with international law. He noted that encouraging steps
forward were being taken in the aforementioned negotiations, aiming at the
achievement of a lasting, stable and guaranteed solution to the question of Gibraltar
in accordance with the relevant resolutions, decisions and practices of the United
Nations and taking into account all legitimate interests of the population of the
Territory. He reiterated the invitation to the Chief Minister of Gibraltar to join
forthcoming meetings of the Brussels process.

30. The representative of the United Kingdom stated that her country welcomed
the efforts by the Committee, begun under the constructive leadership of the
previous Chairman of the Special Committee, to pursue dialogue with the
administering Powers and the peoples of the Territories with a view to their possible
removal from the Committee’s list. Her Government undertook to keep the
Committee informed of discussions with certain Overseas Territories as possible
candidates for delisting. It updated the Committee on the most recent progress in its
relationship with the Overseas Territories. This relationship continued to be based
on the principles of self-determination, mutual obligations, freedom for the
Territories to run their affairs to the greatest degree possible and commitment from
the United Kingdom to help the Territories economically and assist them in
emergencies. The United Kingdom considered its relationship with the Overseas
Territories a partnership and worked to maximize the opportunities for self-
government. It fully respected the unique circumstances in each Territory. The
United Kingdom’s policy towards the Overseas Territories rested on the basis that
the citizens of each Territory determined whether they wished to stay linked to the
United Kingdom or not. The United Kingdom had no intention of imposing
independence against their will, and had willingly granted independence where it
had been requested. The United Kingdom remained firmly committed to the right to
self-determination and to those Territories which chose to retain a British
connection.

Representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories

31. The representative of American Samoa, while supporting the noble goal of the
Special Committee to eradicate colonialism, reiterated his request to the Special
Committee to have the Territory removed from the list of Non-Self-Governing
Territories with which the Committee was concerned and stated that American
Samoa wanted to remain a Territory of the United States of America. He provided
information on the current socio-economic situation in American Samoa and its high
living standards in comparison with other independent States and Territories in the
Pacific region. He expressed concern that, although the Committee had appeared to
accept American Samoa’s position after the Havana Seminar in 2001, he had
perceived no positive progress towards that goal. Given that situation, the
representative of the Territory wanted to know how the elected representatives of the
Territory might help expedite the process.

32. The representative of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) urged the Seminar to
recognize the Falkland Islands Legislative Council as the rightful government of the
Falkland Islands. He stated that the people of the Falkland Islands had the
democratic right to freely determine their status in accordance with General
Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV) and other relevant resolutions of
the United Nations.



40

A/57/23

33. The representative of Gibraltar stated that the people of Gibraltar as colonial
people had the right to self-determination and fundamentally also the right to have
anachronistic demands that gave preference to land claims over the rights of peoples
abandoned as inconsistent with modern times. The right to self-determination of the
people of Gibraltar overrode any obligation in the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713 and that
principle was enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, United Nations
resolutions and the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice. The
Government of Gibraltar was willing to have the matter adjudicated upon by the
International Court of Justice, but the United Kingdom and Spain had refused. The
Government of Gibraltar, as the only democratically elected representatives of the
people of Gibraltar, had been excluded from the current Anglo-Spanish talks
because full and equal participation was being denied to them. His Government
believed in dialogue with Spain on an open agenda and in which the people of
Gibraltar could participate fully through their Government. The so-called
“invitation” to attend the talks from the United Kingdom and Spain was not a
genuine invitation given that Gibraltar would not be participating on an equal
footing and the United Kingdom and Spain reserved exclusively for themselves the
right to reach agreements against the wishes of the Government and people of the
Territory. His Government rejected the intention of the United Kingdom and Spain
to reach an agreement of non-negotiable principles over Gibraltar against the wishes
of the Government and people of Gibraltar. The representative of Gibraltar believed
that such an agreement of principles would necessarily predetermine any proposals
formulated on the basis of those principles; should it go to a referendum and if those
principles were rejected by the people, they would stay on the table as the agreed
Anglo-Spanish position in a state of suspended animation. The representative of
Gibraltar urged the Committee to adopt recommendations on those matters.

34. The representative of New Caledonia stated that the participation of her
Government in the meetings of the Special Committee enabled it to form a clearer
understanding of how the United Nations viewed her country and allowed it to
present the United Nations with a more comprehensive picture. In the year that had
elapsed since the 2001 Havana seminar of the Special Committee, the Government
of New Caledonia had given priority to the systematic implementation of the
directives contained in the policy statement made by the President on 5 May 2001
before the Congress, on behalf of the consensual government. The Government
adopted a comprehensive medical insurance plan that would provide every citizen,
on an equal basis, with protection against health hazards; considerable tax incentives
had also been implemented to encourage job-generating investments not only in the
nickel industry sector but also in the areas of tourism, aquaculture and the food
industry; an agreement on cultural development had also been signed with the
Government of France. Recent economic projects (such as a nickel and cobalt
processing plant and a feasibility study for the construction of a smelting plant) bore
witness to investors’ confidence in the stability of New Caledonia and the ability of
the country’s men and women to respond to the challenges they faced. The
Fourteenth Melanesian Spearhead Group Summit had been held in Nouméa and the
Government of New Caledonia had participated in the thirty-second Pacific Islands
Forum, in Nauru. Those meetings had highlighted the marked readiness of the
Pacific Island countries to integrate New Caledonia speedily into the life of the
region and underlined their ongoing support for the process began by the Nouméa
Accord (A/AC.109/2114, annex). In July 2002, New Caledonia would welcome a
ministerial delegation from the Pacific Islands Forum on a fact-finding visit in



41

A/57/23

regard to the current situation and implementation of the Nouméa Accord. In
conclusion, the representative of New Caledonia stated that she was convinced that
New Caledonia was moving in the right direction, towards a common destiny.

35. The representative of the Front de libération nationale kanak socialiste
(FLNKS) of New Caledonia stated that his movement acknowledged the efforts of
the General Assembly and the work of the Special Committee for having proposed
and agreed to declare the Second International Decade for the Eradication of
Colonialism. He stated that, at the dawn of a new millennium, it was inconceivable
that there should still be vestiges of colonialism and neo-colonialism. Since New
Caledonia had been re-inscribed on the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories by
General Assembly resolution 41/41 A in 1986, the close attention of the United
Nations to the decolonization process had been a determining factor for the
indigenous people struggling for their freedom and independence. The minority
Kanak people believed that the support of the States Members of the United Nations
had been a central factor in ensuring that France would decide the fate of New
Caledonia by taking into account the legitimate rights of the Kanak people and not
simply the electoral majority created by the process of colonial settlement. FLNKS
sought vigilant monitoring by the United Nations, together with the co-signatories of
the Nouméa Accord, to ensure strict adherence to implementation of the Accord.
Each element of the Accord was crucial if the international community was not only
to respond to the aspirations of New Caledonians but also to bring about real
decolonization for the Kanak people. United Nations should remain vigilant to
ensure that the evolving status of New Caledonia would lead to the complete
decolonization and full emancipation of the Kanak people.

36. The representative of the Frente Popular para la Liberación de Saguía el-
Hamra y del Río de Oro (Frente POLISARIO) stated that the decolonization of
Western Sahara had been on the agenda of the United Nations since the 1960s and
remained a case in which the credibility of the Organization and its decolonization
efforts were being placed in jeopardy. After realizing that if a genuine referendum
were to be held, it would favour independence, Morocco had begun obstructing it by
all means. The “draft framework agreement”, which had been proposed as an
alternative to the settlement plan, was an attempt to satisfy Morocco’s aspirations
and legitimize its illegal occupation. It went against the Charter of the United
Nations, its resolutions on Western Sahara and the verdict of the International Court
of Justice and departed from the United Nations and the peace plan of the
Organization of African Unity. Furthermore, it compromised the inalienable right of
the Saharawi people to self-determination and hence contradicted General Assembly
resolution 1514 (XV). The peace plan, which was based on the organization of a
referendum for self-determination, remained the sole legal and viable framework for
reaching a just and lasting resolution to the decolonization process in Western
Sahara. The human rights abuses in the occupied areas must be stopped and the
Saharawi prisoners-of-war held in Morocco must be accounted for. He requested the
Special Committee to send a fact-finding delegation to the occupied areas and the
Saharawi refugee camps and report on its findings. He also requested the United
Nations to mandate its mission, MINURSO, to monitor the human rights situation in
the occupied areas and to stop the illegal exploration and exploitation of the natural
resources of Western Sahara. He suggested that the Special Committee continue to
stress the decolonization nature of the question of Western Sahara and closely
monitor the decolonization process of the last Non-Self-Governing Territory in



42

A/57/23

Africa. He reaffirmed the willingness of his organization to fully cooperate with the
United Nations and OAU in their efforts to organize a free and fair referendum to
enable the Saharawi people to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination.

37. The representative of Tokelau, the Ulu-o-Tokelau, updated the Committee on
political, constitutional and economic developments in the Territory through the
Modern House of Tokelau project, which had as a goal an interlocking cultural
foundation of governance and modern advice that could serve Tokelau better today
and tomorrow. He outlined the four components of the project, namely, good
governance, capacity/capability development, the “friends of Tokelau” network and
sustainable development plans. He reported on the progress of the project, Tokelau’s
achievements and learning so far, and he shared with the Special Committee
Tokelau’s plans for the immediate future. He stated that through the process of
capacity-building, Tokelau was being informed of its capability to perform
effectively some functions, given certain conditions. He stated that the Territory was
becoming aware of what it could not possibly do well for itself because of natural
limitations. He informed the Committee of the Territory’s plan to seek the
establishment of a facility in Wellington, with a Tokelauan personality, that would
become a means of compensating for capacity shortfalls due to human and skill
constraints on the Territory. He urged the Committee to let the Territory explore
carefully and consider those arrangements that would ensure stability, harmony and
human progress with dignity for his people on Tokelau’s journey to self-
determination. The Ulu-o-Tokelau concluded by requesting continued technical and
material support from the Special Committee and the administering Power so that
the Territory could carry out its plans on that journey.

38. The representative of the United States Virgin Islands noted that the “dis-
connect” existing between the United Nations review process and the elected
governments of many Non-Self-Governing Territories resulted in a lack of
information on the contemporary United Nations role in decolonization and self-
determination. He indicated that the recommendations of the regional seminars
should be integrated with the resolutions of the General Assembly and subsequently
implemented. He called on the Special Committee to acquire the necessary resources
to carry out the required studies and analyses of the plan of action of the Second
International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, for potential collaboration
between the Special Committee and the Human Rights Committee to address self-
determination in many of the small island Territories and for similar collaboration
with the Department of Public Information of the United Nations Secretariat on a
programme of dissemination of information on decolonization to the Territories. He
also reported on the Yale University School of Law amicus brief filed in a public
legal proceedings in the United States Virgin Islands which made a number of
findings, including the recognition of the affirmative obligation of States that
administer Territories to promote self-determination pursuant to the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the awareness that non-self-governing status
provided for neither full political nor civil rights and was inconsistent with
obligations under contemporary international law; the acknowledgement of the
conditions under the three alternatives of integration, free association or
independence as essential to the attainment of a full measure of self-government;
and the understanding that no external conditions should be imposed if a fair
political status process is to be conducted in a territory.

A/57/23

Non-governmental organizations

39. A representative of the Guam Commission on Decolonization (Guam) stated
that the decolonization of Guam and the Chamorro people could not be dictated
under the sovereignty of the United States. There should be a moratorium on
immigration to immediately stop the marginalization of the Chamorro people. Guam
should experience self-determination, create its own constitution, its own testament
that it consents to a full measure of self-government, at its free expression — not as
dictated by a mightier power, not as dissatisfied second-class citizens. The
Chamorro people, and all residents of Guam who would declare Guam their home,
must be afforded a fully supported education outreach to discuss the issue of
decolonization. Guam needed the full support of the United Nations, as is the
obligation of the administering Power, to empower the Chamorro people to make
decisions regarding their future, to understand the self-determination and
decolonization process and the various political status options, and to draft their
own constitution. The people of Guam needed to be fully involved in the
reorganizing of their government, in the governing of Guam, in preparation for the
future, as sovereign as the other nations and peoples of the world.

40. A representative of Strength and Force of Chamorro Women, a non-
governmental organization from Guam, stated that not much had changed in the
situation of Guam for the preceding 20 years aside from the administering Power’s
disregard for the process of decolonization and its control of one third of the island
for military purposes. The administering Power’s policy on immigration had
unnaturally increased Guam’s population growth rate while diminishing
significantly its social, economic, cultural and political institutions.

41. A representative of the World Council of Churches/Commission of the
Churches on International Affairs, a non-governmental organization, recalled the
statement of the World Council of Churches and Society Conference in 1966 that the
United Nations was the best structure available through which to pursue the goals of
international peace and justice. Like all institutions, it was not sacrosanct and many
changes were necessary in its Charter to meet the needs of the world today, but it
had to be defended against all attacks that would weaken or destroy it and it had to
seek out and advocate ways in which it could be transformed into an instrument
fully capable of ensuring peace and guaranteeing justice on a worldwide scale. In
conclusion, he stated that in the Second International Decade for the Eradication of
Colonialism, the World Council of Churches and its Commission of the Churches on
International Affairs pledged its continuing support and partnership both to the
United Nations and the Special Committee.

42. A representative of the Pacific Concerns Resource Centre, Inc., a non-
governmental organization from the Pacific region, emphasized that the legacy of
colonialism was a significant feature in the region and that memories of racism and
discrimination remained fresh in the minds of people. Her organization continued to
stand in solidarity with all colonized peoples in their struggle against colonialism.
She also stressed that the implementation of the plan of action for the Second
International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism needed serious political
commitment on the part of the Special Committee in order to coordinate a
meaningful process of decolonization based on the aspirations of colonized peoples.

43. A representative of the Pitcairn Islands Study Center, a non-governmental
organization from the United States, presented the views of his organization on the



44

A/57/23

ways and means to ensure the viability of Pitcairn as a unique Non-Self-Governing
Territory and highlighted current issues which needed urgent assistance on the part
of the international community and the Special Committee.

Experts

44. Experts presented papers dealing with questions and issues proposed by the
Special Committee, as reflected above. The experts discussed in detail the political,
economic and social development of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, with
particular emphasis on the conditions in the small island Non-Self-Governing
Territories in the Pacific region. The experts maintained the following:

(a) The current stage of the decolonization process highlights the need for
solutions to the difficulties encountered by the Non-Self-Governing Territories and
the administering Powers to be adapted to the special circumstance of each of the 16
Territories; the differences in each case are as great as the commonalities;

(b) An approach based on the needs of the Territory following the directions
indicated by the people will respond well to the emphasis on self-government and
self-determination;

(c) An investigation into an autochthonous approach may be rewarding in
many cases;

(d) The activities of the Special Committee’s Working Group on case-by-
case individual programmes of work for each Territory are well adapted to
facilitating the territory-by-territory approach and provide a useful vehicle for
stimulating the dialogue now needed. The case-by-case method also requires greater
exploration of the great range of possibilities for a Territory’s future that lie within
the free association option and the integration option in particular; a concerted effort
should be made to identify those aspects of the current situation that correspond
with the self-determination futures and to adapt as appropriate private law analogies
to meet the specific challenges of the Second International Decade for the
Eradication of Colonialism;

(e) There is a crucial connection between environment and development for
small island developing States in the Pacific;

(f) Some policies of the administering Powers adversely affect the political,
economic and social structures of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, including the
transport of radioactive and hazardous wastes through island exclusive economic
zones and fishing grounds;

(g) The programmes of assistance directed to the Territories should take into
account climate change and global warming factors;

(h) The impact of military bases and operations in the Territories should be
further investigated.

45. The experts from Saint Helena and Pitcairn, who were also elected officials in
their respective Territories, provided unique perspectives on the issues of concern to
their communities:

(a) With regard to Saint Helena, it was noted that the current situation, where
depopulation and economic decline linked to falling budgetary assistance threatened
the future well-being of the island, could not be allowed to continue; it was vital for



45

A/57/23

improved access and inward investment to be developed, and for that the island
would require ongoing assistance from the administering Power; the continuing
spiral of economic decline and offshore migration presented the prospect of a bleak
future unless the pattern was checked and reversed. It was hoped that the visit of an
independent constitutional adviser later in 2002 would offer a unifying platform for
the administering Power to work with the people of Saint Helena to develop a way
forward constitutionally to the exercise of the people’s right to self-determination in
the context of the relevant General Assembly resolutions;

(b) With regard to Pitcairn, it was noted that the lack of information from the
administering Power and from the United Nations regarding the options available
for the inhabitants of that unique Territory was a serious impediment to the exercise
of their right to self-determination and development. It was also noted that, despite
the current serious economic and other infrastructure problems, the Territory had
potential for the development and rehabilitation of a viable community on Pitcairn.

IV. Conclusions and recommendations

46. At its 6th meeting, held on 16 May 2002, the Seminar adopted the following
conclusions and recommendations:

Eradicating colonialism

1. The participants at the Seminar strongly supported the statement of the
Secretary-General of the United Nations in his message to the Seminar (see
appendix V) that there should be no room for colonialism in the twenty-first
century, and that all efforts should be made to close that chapter of history
once and for all.

2. The participants welcomed the accession to independence of East Timor
on 20 May 2002 and expressed the hope that that momentous event would
further strengthen the resolve of the international community to ensure the
implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to
Colonial Countries and Peoples in the remaining Non-Self-Governing
Territories.

3. The United Nations has a valid ongoing role in the process of
decolonization. The mandate of the Special Committee is a major political
programme of the United Nations.

4. The Seminar reaffirms that the Second International Decade for the
Eradication of Colonialism is an important political framework for continued
efforts in support of the process of decolonization and the role of the United
Nations in such a process. The participants called for the full implementation
of the plan of action for the Second International Decade for the Eradication of
Colonialism (A/56/61, annex).

5. The Seminar recommends that the Special Committee, the administering
Powers and the Non-Self-Governing Territories engage in constructive
discussions to expedite the implementation of the goals of the Second



46

A/57/23

International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism as contained in
General Assembly resolution 55/146 of 8 December 2000.

Right to self-determination

6. The implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence
to Colonial Countries and Peoples contained in General Assembly resolution
1514 (XV) is not complete as long as there remain Non-Self-Governing
Territories that have yet to exercise their right to self-determination.

7. As long as the administering Powers exercise unilateral authority to make
laws and other regulations affecting the Non-Self-Governing Territories
without their consent, pursuant to such methods as legislation, orders in
council and other methods, a Territory should not be considered self-
governing.

8. In this process of decolonization, there is no alternative to the principle
of self-determination, which is also a fundamental human right. All available
options for self-determination are valid as long as they are in accordance with
the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned and in conformity with
the clearly defined principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations,
and as enunciated in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV)
and other relevant resolutions and decisions.

9. Specific characteristics of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories
should in no way prevent their populations from exercising their inalienable
right to self-determination in conformity with the Charter of the United
Nations and General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV).

10. Any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity
and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and
principles of the Charter.

11. The views of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories in
respect of their right to self-determination should be ascertained under the
supervision of the United Nations.

12. The participants expressed the view that, as long as there are Non-Self-
Governing Territories, the inalienable rights of the peoples of those Territories
must be guaranteed by the United Nations and the Special Committee in
conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and General Assembly
resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV).

13. While the international community must remain flexible in its approach
to assisting the Non-Self-Governing Territories in their constitutional
advancement, efforts should be made to guarantee their advancement in
conformity with the acceptable choices contained in General Assembly
resolution 1541 (XV).

14. All efforts should be made by Member States, when presenting draft
resolutions on decolonization to the General Assembly, to take into account the
views, as appropriate, of the people of the Territories concerned.



47

A/57/23

Role of the Special Committee

15. The Special Committee should continue to actively participate in
monitoring and observing the evolution of the Non-Self-Governing Territories
towards self-determination, as well as to certify to the General Assembly the
compliance of this process with the norms and practices of the United Nations.

16. In the current stage of global development, there is still a need for
identifying and implementing innovative practical and pragmatic approaches in
the search for a specific solution for each of the remaining Non-Self-
Governing Territories in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the
populations concerned and in conformity with the Charter of the United
Nations, General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV) and other
relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations.

17. The informal negotiations between the Special Committee and the
administering Powers to create a work programme on a case-by-case basis for
the decolonization of the Non-Self-Governing Territories should be expedited
with the active involvement of the representatives of the Territories, and other
interested parties, where appropriate.

18. The Seminar urges the Special Committee to initiate action to implement
the programme of work it prepared regarding the situation in the Territories
and thus take a further step forward in implementing its mandate. It urges the
administering Powers to cooperate with the Special Committee in such an
endeavour.

19. The participants note that, in the development of work programmes for
individual Territories, the participation of representatives of the Non-Self-
Governing Territories in which there is no dispute over sovereignty should be
ensured. They also point out that any work programme should include an
information and education campaign for the peoples of said Territories, visiting
missions of the Special Committee to ascertain the situation in those Territories
first-hand and a consultation process acceptable to the peoples in those
Territories leading to the exercise of their right to self-determination in
accordance with United Nations resolutions.

20. The participants recall paragraph 22 of the plan of action for the Second
International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, which states that the
Special Committee should: (a) prepare periodic analyses of the progress and
extent of the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in each Territory; and
(b) review the impact of the economic and social situation on the constitutional
and political advancement of the Non-Self-Governing Territories; and the
necessary resources should be made available, if so required, for the conduct of
such studies and reviews.

21. The Seminar takes note of the initiation of discussions between the
Special Committee and the administering Powers of American Samoa and
Pitcairn with a view to developing work programmes for the Territories with
the participation and agreement of the representatives of the peoples of those
Territories.



48

A/57/23

Public awareness/information campaigns

22. Continued examination of the spectrum of options for self-determination
by all parties concerned and dissemination of relevant information among the
peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories are important elements in
achieving the goals of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to
Colonial Countries and Peoples and the plan of action.

23. The participants affirmed the need for the Special Committee to actively
embark on a public awareness campaign aimed at fostering an understanding
among the people of the Territories of the options for self-determination
included in the relevant United Nations resolutions on decolonization,
especially within the context of developing programmes of work for specific
Territories.

24. The Seminar recommended that the Special Committee, in conjunction
with the Department of Public Information and other relevant United Nations
bodies, develop a programme to disseminate information and raise public
awareness in the Territories in order to heighten people’s understanding of the
legitimate political status options available to them in accordance with the
relevant United Nations resolutions, including the 1960 Declaration, and
bearing in mind the successful programmes in this vein undertaken for the
former trust territories.

25. The participants welcomed the establishment of a decolonization web
page and requested the Department of Political Affairs and the Department of
Public Information of the Secretariat to update the web page regularly and to
use that tool to intensify the dissemination of information on the activities of
the United Nations in decolonization, with a view to raising the awareness of
the people about their political rights and the options available to them in
determining their political status. The Department of Public Information
should use all means of communication, including radio, television and
publications, to promote the cause of decolonization.

26. United Nations information centres should be directed to disseminate
information on decolonization to the Territories and to the administering
Powers.

27. The participants encourage the United Nations to assist those Non-Self-
Governing Territories which are granted observer status in United Nations
world conferences and special sessions of the General Assembly by facilitating
the dissemination of information to those Territories regarding the respective
sessions.

28. Noting the need for more information to be submitted to the Secretary-
General under Article 73e of the Charter, the Seminar called for the continued
use of the comprehensive questionnaire detailing the specific areas of
economic, social and political development on which information should be
furnished.



49

A/57/23

Visiting missions

29. The participants confirmed the need to dispatch periodic visiting
missions to the Non-Self-Governing Territories with the aim of assessing the
situation in those Territories and of ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of
the peoples thereof regarding their future status and called on the administering
Powers to cooperate in facilitating such visiting missions. They noted the
numerous requests made at the Seminar from representatives of Non-Self-
Governing Territories for visiting missions to be undertaken as soon as
possible.

Cooperation with and assistance from agencies of the
United Nations system

30. The participants supported closer cooperation between the Special
Committee and the Economic and Social Council in order to promote increased
United Nations assistance in the economic and social sphere to the Non-Self-
Governing Territories.

31. Subject to approval by the Economic and Social Council, Non-Self-
Governing Territories should be given access to relevant United Nations
programmes in the economic and social sphere, including those emanating
from the plans of action of United Nations world conferences, in furtherance of
capacity-building and consistent with the necessary preparation for the
attainment of a full measure of internal self-government.

32. The Seminar stressed that the Special Committee should continue to
explore ways to strengthen existing measures of support and formulate
appropriate programmes of assistance to the remaining Non-Self-Governing
Territories and seek concrete proposals for the full implementation of the
relevant resolutions by the specialized agencies as detailed in the provisions of
the General Assembly resolution 56/67 of 10 December 2001.

33. The participants urged the Special Committee to solicit assistance of the
Economic and Social Council regarding the implementation of Council
resolution 2001/28 of 26 July 2001 on the implementation of the Declaration
on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the
specialized agencies and international institutions associated with the United
Nations.

34. The participants recognized the vulnerability of small island Non-Self-
Governing Territories, which require special consideration and remedies.

35. The participants were appreciative of the success of the special session of
the General Assembly on children and stressed that the special needs of
children in Non-Self-Governing Territories should be addressed when
implementing the guidelines of the final document of the special session.

36. The Seminar reiterated its support for the current participation of the
Non-Self-Governing Territories in the relevant regional commissions of the
United Nations and in specialized agencies of the United Nations and called
for the increased involvement of the Non-Self-Governing Territories in
programmes and activities of the United Nations system in furtherance of the



50

A/57/23

decolonization process subject to the rules of procedure of the General
Assembly and in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions and
decisions, including General Assembly and Special Committee resolutions and
decisions on specific Territories.

37. The participants request those members of the Special Committee that are
members of the Economic and Social Council to support the inclusion of those
Non-Self-Governing Territories which are associate members of United
Nations regional commissions as observers in the Council pursuant to the
relevant resolution of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean, and in accordance with the rules of procedure of the Council.

Developments in Non-Self-Governing Territories

38. The participants express concern over the military installations and
activities of the administering Powers in Non-Self-Governing Territories,
which run counter to the rights and interests of the people concerned and
which create serious health and environmental hazards and request the Special
Committee to address this issue in an appropriate manner, including a call for
the removal of such installations. In addition, the participants propose the
provision of alternative sources of livelihood for the peoples of Non-Self-
Governing Territories.

39. The participants welcomed the participation in the Seminar of the
Chairman of the Public Health and Social Services Committee of St. Helena,
who participated in her personal capacity as an expert, and reiterated their
support for the establishment of a secure, healthy and sustainable social,
economic and political environment for the future of St. Helena. The
participants noted the latest developments regarding constitutional changes in
St. Helena and looked forward to cooperation between the administering
Power and the people of St. Helena on the process leading towards
constitutional advancement of the territory.

40. The participants welcomed the presence for the first time of the Mayor of
Pitcairn, who participated in his personal capacity as an expert. They took note
of the economic and social problems faced by the population of the Island and
of the action taken by the administering Power to meet needs of the people of
Pitcairn and expressed the hope that those needs would continue to be given
full consideration. Furthermore, they encouraged the administering Power to
involve the representatives of the people of Pitcairn in any forthcoming
discussion on the future of the Territory to the greatest degree possible.

41. The participants took note of the statement made by the Lieutenant
Governor of American Samoa at the Seminar. The participants urged the
administering Power to expedite plans to examine the case of American Samoa
in order to further the programme of work in cooperation with the Special
Committee. They reaffirmed the need for the Special Committee to conduct
urgent contacts with the Governor, the President of the Senate and Senators,
the Speaker of the House and representatives of the Legislature, and the
Congressman and other community leaders and other representatives of the
Territory and the administering Power with the aim of implementing the



51

A/57/23

positions adopted by the Special Committee in compliance with the relevant
resolutions and decisions of the United Nations.

42. The Special Committee should continue to encourage the resumption of
negotiations between the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom,
with the aim of finding a solution to the question of the Falkland Islands
(Malvinas) and taking into consideration the interests of the population of the
Territory, in accordance with the relevant resolutions and decisions of the
United Nations.

43. The Special Committee should continue to encourage the ongoing
negotiations between the Governments of the United Kingdom and Spain
within the Brussels process, aimed at achieving a solution to the question of
Gibraltar in accordance with the relevant resolutions and decisions of the
United Nations.

44. The Seminar, while recognizing the significant developments that have
taken place in New Caledonia, mainly the signing of the Nouméa Accord on 5
May 1998 between representatives of the political forces of New Caledonia
and the Government of France, takes the view that the United Nations should
continue to watch closely and keep under review the process unfolding in the
Territory. The Seminar has considered the different points of view expressed
by the participants about compliance with the provisions of the Accord and
urges the concerned parties to implement the provisions of the Accord in a
spirit of harmony and cooperation. The Seminar recalls the visit to New
Caledonia by a delegation of representatives to the United Nations in 1999 and
recommends that those missions visit the Territory regularly during the
transition period.

45. The participants recommend that the Special Committee call upon the
United States, as the administering Power for Guam, to work with Guam’s
Commission on Decolonization for the Implementation and Exercise of
Chamorro Self-determination with a view to facilitating the decolonization of
Guam and to keep the Secretary-General informed of progress to that end.

46. The Special Committee should request the administering Power for
Guam, in cooperation with the territorial Government, to continue to transfer
land to the original landowners of the Territory. The Special Committee should
also request the administering Power to promote the Government of Guam’s
Chamorro Land Trust Commission programmes for the Chamorro people.

47. The United Nations should further request the administering Power for
Guam to continue to recognize and respect the political rights and the cultural
and ethnic identity of the Chamorro people of Guam, and to take all necessary
measures to respond to the concerns of the territorial Government with regard
to the immigration issue.

48. The Seminar called upon the administering Power to cooperate with the
Government of Guam to develop and promote political education for the
indigenous people of Guam, the Chamorros, on their right to self-
determination.



52

A/57/23

49. The participants called upon the Special Committee to engage the
administering Power and the representatives of the Territory with a view to
developing a specific work programme for Guam.

50. The Seminar notes with satisfaction the positive constitutional
developments in the Territory of Tokelau. The relationship between Tokelau
and its administering Power, New Zealand, has been conducive to the
increased level of internal self-government and the enactment of territorial
legislation, bringing the people of Tokelau closer to the exercise of the right to
self-determination.

51. The Seminar notes the Territory’s plan to seek the establishment of a
facility, with a Tokelauan personality, in Wellington, New Zealand, which will
become a means of meeting the needs for expertise not currently available in
the Territory.

52. The Seminar also notes with satisfaction the substantial work being
carried out by Tokelau to establish a governance structure through the Modern
House of Tokelau project that will enable Tokelau to maintain its unique
identity and respond to the challenges of the new century. It acknowledged the
collaborative basis on which that project was being undertaken with the
administering Power. Furthermore, the Seminar notes with appreciation the
draft work programme for Tokelau prepared collaboratively with the
Administrator and the Ulu-o-Tokelau and urged the parties concerned to carry
out the necessary discussions to finalize the work programme and adopt it as a
guideline for future action by the Special Committee on Tokelau.

53. With regard to Western Sahara, the Seminar urges the two parties to
continue, under the auspices of the Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy, to try
to resolve the multiple problems relating to the implementation of the
settlement plan and try to agree upon a mutually acceptable political solution
to their dispute over Western Sahara.

Administering Powers and other States Members of the 
United Nations

54. The Special Committee should note with satisfaction the cooperation of
France and New Zealand in the process of decolonization and welcome their
presence at Special Committee meetings. The participants reiterate their call
upon other administering Powers to engage the Special Committee in
constructive dialogue in future.

55. The participants welcome the presence as an observer at the Seminar, of
the representative of the United Kingdom. They also welcome the statement of
the representative of the United Kingdom regarding its intention to continue to
engage with the Special Committee, with a view to enhancing cooperation.

56. The Special Committee should express its appreciation to Argentina,
Japan (as an observer), Morocco and Spain for their active participation in the
Seminar and encourage other Member States to continue to cooperate with the
Special Committee.



53

A/57/23

Role of the regional seminars

57. As activities of the International Decade for the Eradication of
Colonialism, the regional seminars serve as an effective forum for focused
discussion on matters of concern to the Non-Self-Governing Territories and
afford opportunities for representatives of the peoples of the Territories to
present their views and recommendations to the Special Committee.

58. The regional nature of the seminars, alternating between the Caribbean
and the Pacific, is a crucial element in their success. The administering Powers
should be urged to facilitate the participation of the elected representatives of
the Non-Self-Governing Territories in the seminars and in sessions of the
Special Committee and the Special Political and Decolonization Committee
(Fourth Committee) in conformity with the relevant resolutions and decisions
of the United Nations.

59. The Seminar recommended that the Special Committee integrate, to the
extent possible, the recommendations of the regional seminars into its relevant
resolutions on decolonization, as those recommendations are important
expressions of the will of the people of the Territories.

60. The Special Committee should adopt the report of the Pacific Regional
Seminar and include it in its report to the General Assembly, as it did with the
report of the Caribbean Regional Seminar, in Havana in 2001.

61. The participants emphasized the desirability of holding future seminars in
the Non-Self-Governing Territories with a view to educating the respective
peoples in those Territories regarding the aims and objectives of the Second
International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. Furthermore, they
emphasized that such seminars would reflect in more precise ways the feelings
and aspirations of the peoples of those Territories. The administering Powers
are called upon to facilitate the holding of future seminars in the Non-Self-
Governing Territories.

62. The Seminar reiterates the importance of the conclusions and
recommendations adopted at the previous regional seminars held in Vanuatu
(1990) and Barbados (1990), Grenada (1992), Papua New Guinea (1993 and
1996), Trinidad and Tobago (1995), Antigua and Barbuda (1997), Fiji (1998),
Saint Lucia (1999) the Marshall Islands (2000) and Cuba (2001).

47. At the same meeting, the participants adopted a resolution expressing
appreciation to the Government and people of Fiji.

Statement by the Honourable Kaliopate Tavola, Minister
for Foreign Affairs and External Trade of Fiji

As a mark of Fiji’s deep respect for the rights of people to exercise self-
determination, and our commitment to the issue of decolonization, we readily
offered our land and country as the venue for this seminar.

Our national anthem speaks of our land of freedom, hope and glory. We are
totally committed to living up to these fine virtues. I might add that we are also
committed to bringing peace and independence where these are needed.

Your presence in Fiji today is most gratifying for us, especially as we embark
on the Second International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. We have
witnessed, with great satisfaction, the changing landscape of the independent world
due to the progress of the decolonization process since the inception of the United
Nations. However, we should not rest on our laurels.

Together, we have the shared resolve to accelerate the momentum of the
decolonization process compared with that achieved during the First Decade.

It is a fitting recognition to this seminar that the people of East Timor will be
independent on 20 May, next week. That historic event is the culmination of
successful general elections, of the dedicated efforts of the transitional government
by the Constituent Assembly of East Timor, of the promulgation of their new
Constitution, and the election thereunder of President-elect Xanana Gusmao.

I am, as a matter of fact, one of the privileged ones who will be present at the
independence celebrations next week. My Permanent Secretary and I will be joining
the people and Government of East Timor in Dili to celebrate that historic event.

My gratitude of course goes to the Government of New Zealand for inviting us
to join their delegation, and their offer of seats on one of their air force planes,
which will be taking us to Dili.

As a result of these events, and in full confidence that independence will be
achieved next week, the General Assembly, as you know, has adopted by consensus
the resolution on the question of East Timor. The Assembly has thus effectively
decided to remove East Timor from the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories upon
its accession to independence. This accomplishment is a tribute to the dedicated
work of the Special Committee. The contribution of the respective Governments in
this matter is a single most important factor in this world-changing and epoch-
making process. Fiji congratulates you all as representatives of your governments in
the Special Committee.

I take this opportunity also to commend you for your continued focus on the
remaining Territories on the Special Committee’s list. In particular, we are heartened
by your efforts to keep alive the aspirations of the peoples in these Territories in
their quest for independence. These Territories are predominantly in the Caribbean
and Pacific regions.

I can say with certainty that this seminar gives real hope to the Pacific peoples
that the United Nations is engaged in dialogue with administering States in search
for some lasting solutions.



58

A/57/23

In these deliberations, Fiji stands ready to assist in every way possible, if and
when our assistance is needed.

Fiji acknowledges the commitments made by some administering States and
the progress of the action programmes in their respective Territories. As a result of
these commitments, forward movements are obviously taking place. However, we
appreciate that not “one size fits all” is relevant in this task.

Mindful of the delicate sensitivities that are inevitable in any decolonization
negotiation, Fiji continues to urge the parties to push ahead and achieve the end of
decolonization early, rather than late in the second Decade.

As a long advocate for decolonization and independence, particularly for
peoples in the Pacific region, Fiji reiterates its continuing interest in the progress
thus far achieved for the Kanak people in New Caledonia under the Matignon and
Nouméa Accords. We commend especially the fact that a climate of peace and
amicable cooperation has reigned during this political process. Already, the Kanak
leadership has been able to participate meaningfully in their own right in various
regional initiatives, including, for the first time, as host of the South Pacific Festival
of Arts, Chairman of the Melanesian Spearhead Group and host of the Group’s
Summit. Other activities give credibility to New Caledonian institutions, their
workings and the implementation of the Nouméa Accord.

I was in New Caledonia just over two weeks ago, with a 16-member Fiji trade
mission, which, I must say, was very successful indeed. I did recognize then, and I
still do today, the useful role contributed to that success by the Kanak leadership.

The Pacific Island Forum leaders have maintained a keen interest in
decolonization issues in our region. Since close cooperation with the United Nations
has now been established, and in view of the positive interconnectedness that
subregional progress on decolonization will generate regionally and globally, Fiji
hopes that this Pacific Regional Seminar on Decolonization will abundantly bear
fruit on this item and on other agenda items that are closely interwoven.

The majority of the Non-Self-Governing Territories on the Special
Committee’s list are in the Pacific and Caribbean regions, as I stated earlier. Each
has its merits as well as distinct constraints in the path to decolonization. Individual
work programmes for each Territory may provide the ideal agreed platform for the
parties to work out their mutual path to complete decolonization. In that regard, I
recognize that two open-ended informal working groups under the aegis of the
Special Committee were established to pursue in earnest the process in those
Territories. One of them has been assigned the responsibility for the Caribbean
Territories and the other for the Pacific and other Territories. The groups have been
liaising and working in close consultation and cooperation with the respective
administering Powers and the peoples of those Territories.

Informally, this is the basis for work in respect of Tokelau and for initial
discussions on a similar work programme for Guam. May I submit that these
initiatives could be formalized and strengthened as a strategy that will catalyse the
entire process.

Finally, I take this opportunity to give positive acclaim to the Outcomes of the
special session of the General Assembly on children, which concluded successfully
in New York last week. As children are our future, they are most definitely our



59

A/57/23

present as well. As you deliberate, I propose that this seminar keep in focus the
aspirations of the world’s children. Where there is no independence, the future of
our children is bleak. Indeed, their very presence must be cause for grave concern to
leaders, as is well captured by the Millennium Summit, and is now formulated in the
Millennium Development Goals. Member States are obligated under these global
initiatives to deliver results accordingly.

For our part here in Nadi this week, in this small corner of the vast Pacific
Ocean, we can reaffirm that independence is a path to ensuring the future
sustainability of generations to come. We can also reaffirm our solidarity with those
whose very existence we are addressing this week.

I wish you all a very meaningful and productive meeting.

Appendix III
Statement by Earl Stephen Huntley, Permanent
Representative of Saint Lucia to the United Nations,
Chairman of the Special Committee

I wish to thank Mr. Kaliopate Tavola, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, for the
warm welcome he has extended to all of us as we begin the proceedings of the 2002
Pacific Regional Seminar. On behalf of all the members of the Special Committee, I
wish to thank the Government and the people of Fiji for generously hosting the first
Pacific regional seminar of the Second International Decade for the Eradication of
Colonialism to review the political, economic and social conditions in the Non-Self-
Governing Territories. At this inaugural meeting, I should also like to draw your
attention to the observance of the Week of Solidarity with the Peoples of Non-Self-
Governing Territories. The Week of Solidarity, scheduled to begin on 25 May, is an
expression of support by the international community for the peoples in the
Territories and a celebration of their achievements.

As a member of the Special Committee, Fiji makes an important contribution
to the work of the Committee and is a steadfast and respected voice in promoting the
implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples. Fiji’s principled support for the cause of decolonization is
also made evident given the presence of its Minister for Foreign Affairs at this
ceremony and by the fact that this is the second time in four years that Fiji hosts a
Pacific regional seminar. I wish, therefore, on behalf of the members of the
Committee, to reiterate our tribute to the Government and people of Fiji for their
profound commitment to the cause of decolonization and, more generally, to the
fundamental principles of justice, equal rights and self-determination of peoples
which the United Nations has pledged to uphold.

I am pleased to welcome to this seminar representatives from the Non-Self-
Governing Territories as well as experts and non-governmental organizations. The
participation of each and every one of you is important to the Committee’s effective
discharge of its responsibilities. The Committee needs the information you provide
regarding the situation in the Territories and it welcomes your ideas and proposals
regarding ways to achieve the objectives of the Second International Decade for the
Eradication of Colonialism. I want you to see the Committee as a friend, prepared
and committed to work with you and on your behalf to attain the rights that are
indisputably yours.

I am also pleased to welcome representatives of Member States, in particular
of the administering Powers. Their cooperation is essential for the Committee to be
able to fulfil its mandate. The renewed dialogue with the administering Powers
begun under the chairmanship of Peter Donigi should continue and intensify.
However, thus far, the Committee has only been able to move forward in its
discussions with New Zealand about developing a work programme for Tokelau.
Consultations with other administering Powers has yet to result in concrete advances
in developing a programme of work for specific Territories that have been agreed
upon or in identifying the Territories that will be the subject of discussion between
the Committee and the administering Power.

A/57/23

I should like on this occasion to renew the Committee’s invitation to the
administering Powers to participate in its activities and to resume consultations with
a view to taking steps to develop programmes of work for the specific Territories
identified and agreed to with the Special Committee. As we enter this new age, it is
time to change attitudes, to stop seeing the Committee as a foe to be obstructed. As
members of the same international organization, the United Nations, it is incumbent
upon us to make our Organization successful; this can redound in our benefit.

I would like to point out that, at this seminar, we have for the first time ever, a
representative of Pitcairn, the smallest and most remote island Territory. Only two
years ago, we had a representative of St. Helena for the first time, I am glad to see
that, this year, a representative of St. Helena is again in our midst. Their presence at
our seminar, despite the considerable difficulties of transport, attests to their desire
to draw our attention to the issues that are of importance to their respective
Territories and of the efforts of the Committee to reach out to the peoples in the
Territories in order to learn about their day-to-day concerns and problems and their
aspirations for the future.

Many of these Territories face similar problems given their small size, their
geographical remoteness in some instances, their scarce resources and their
vulnerability to natural disasters. There is much in the experience of those attending
this seminar that should prove invaluable not only to the Committee but to the
participants from the Territories who will undoubtedly take advantage of the
opportunity to exchange views and share common experiences and ways to handle
similar problems with colleagues, counterparts from the other Territories and
experts.

We are grateful that you have joined us here for what promises to be an
interesting and fruitful discussion. The agenda of the Seminar is wide-ranging in
order to accommodate all aspects of the situation in the Territories. We are looking
forward to hearing your presentations, questions and answers and exchange of
views. And equally important, we are looking forward to the recommendations you
may wish to propose for the Committee’s consideration with a view to attaining the
goals set out in the Plan of Action of the Second International Decade for the
Eradication of Colonialism.

As I said when I assumed the chairmanship of this Committee earlier this year,
there must not be a third International Decade to Eradicate Colonialism. Let us all
work together to ensure this.

Appendix IV
Statement by the Rapporteur of the Special Committee

In my capacity as Rapporteur of the Special Committee, I should like to brief
you about the work the Committee has carried out since we last met for the
Caribbean Regional Seminar, held in Havana in 2001. I shall be very, very brief, as
we are all looking forward to hearing the presentations of the participants and the
discussions that will ensue.

As you know, the Havana Seminar was a resounding success and the
Committee felt greatly encouraged by the enthusiastic participation of the territorial
Governments at the highest levels as well as by the attendance of a record number of
Member States, experts and non-governmental organizations concerned with the
question of decolonization.

The presence of the representative of the United Kingdom as an observer at the
Seminar was also noteworthy and the overwhelming majority of participants took
note with satisfaction of such a presence and expressed the hope that the United
Kingdom would continue to attend in the future. I should also like to point out that
the representative of France also attended the Seminar and that France, the
administering Power for New Caledonia, has attended several regional seminars side
by side with the representatives of the Territory.

We are gratified to note at this meeting that France and the United Kingdom
are once again present.

We are also pleased to welcome the representative of New Zealand, an
administering Power whose exemplary cooperation has facilitated the work of the
Committee and is now involved, together with the representatives of Tokelau in
developing a work programme for Tokelau.

Last year, on the occasion of the June session of the Special Committee, the
delegations of New Zealand and Tokelau met with the working group for the Pacific
region, chaired by Peter Donigi of Papua New Guinea. At that meeting, the working
group had an informative exchange of views and took the first steps towards
developing a programme of work for Tokelau.

The atmosphere of the meeting and the face-to-face contact between the
Special Committee and the delegations of New Zealand and Tokelau marked the
beginning of a new stage in the consideration of this matter by the Committee. The
frank and candid discussions went a long way towards dispelling some
misconceptions as to the nature of our discussions and its purposes while allowing
all sides to clarify and expand on issues that are encapsulated in the language of
resolutions or in the headings of the generic work programme the Special
Committee adopted informally in March 2000 and which is serving as the indicator
and reference document for our discussions and the development of specific work
programmes. Of particular significance for the Committee, were the statements by
the representatives of the people of Tokelau, who told us that the working meetings
with the Special Committee had succeeded in giving it a “human face”. The Tokelau
delegation pointed out that sitting across the table, talking with the interlocutors of
the Special Committee, gave them a sense that Committee members were people
who responded to their concerns and reassured them that the pace of the process



63

A/57/23

they were engaged in would be flexible and would accommodate their needs and the
particular characteristics of the Territory.

A draft working paper was then prepared, roughly following the format of the
generic work programme, but adapted to the case of Tokelau. The response of the
administering Power has been received by the Special Committee and has been
distributed to the members of the Committee for future review.

The Special Committee expects that further discussions will be held at the
forthcoming session of the Committee.

If we look at the generic programme of work, we will see that activities 1 and
2 refer to the objectives of work coordination and the attainment of a greater
understanding of the situation facing the Territory.

These are basic steps that allow us to agree on the modalities of our
consultations and on development targets. Regarding the briefing and the exchange
of views that will enable the Committee to gain a greater understanding of the
situation in Tokelau or any of the Territories identified for which work programmes
will be developed, there is some preliminary thinking as to the various ways in
which the Committee will carry out its analysis of the situation and the type of
information it will require as well as the manner in which the information will be
presented. The Committee has the working papers prepared by the Secretariat. These
by their very nature are not analytical studies and they were not meant to be.

They present factual information. We will be tapping the collective wisdom of
this Seminar and welcome suggestions from the participants, including the
representatives of the Territories, the administering Powers and the experts,
academics and non-governmental organizations represented here.

As you know, the Plan of Action for the Second International Decade for the
Eradication of Colonialism envisages that the Committee will carry out an analysis
of the progress achieved by the Non-Self-Governing Territories and of the impact
that the socio-economic situation has had on their march towards self-government.
Such activities are particularly relevant in the context of developing a programme of
work and the implementation of such a programme.

Information campaigns are also mentioned in the Plan of Action as one of the
activities to be carried out in the Territories regarding the options available to them.
This is also a very important aspect of the steps outlined in the generic work
programme and of great relevance in the development and implementation of a work
programme for the Territories. All these activities become more focused and
purposeful in the context of working together with the administering Power and the
representatives of the specific Territories in developing and implementing
programmes of work for their decolonization.

As we move along our discussions regarding Tokelau, we are breaking new
ground and adapting our generic work programme to the Territory’s specific
circumstances. The objectives of the Declaration and the Plan of Action of the
Second International Decade guide us and translate into practical measures that are
intended to make the whole process transparent, with clear goals, activities and
target dates. It is an exciting and challenging chapter for the work of the Committee
and we only hope it will serve as an example and encouragement for the other
Territories that are next in line.



64

A/57/23

Before concluding, I should also like to refer to the presence in our Seminar of
new participants — especially those from Pitcairn and St. Helena. We are aware of
the difficulties involved in your coming here and we appreciate the effort you have
made and are looking forward to hearing your presentations regarding your
Territories. And to all of those of you who are well known to us, we also express our
appreciation and gratitude for the valuable information you bring to our Committee
and for your perseverance and commitment to the cause of decolonization.

Appendix V
Message from the Secretary-General

On the occasion of the Week of Solidarity with the Peoples of the Non-Self-
Governing Territories, I am pleased to send my greetings to all who have gathered in
Nadi, Fiji, for the Pacific Regional Seminar on decolonization.

Next week we shall witness a joyous event in the history of decolonization,
when East Timor joins the ranks of sovereign States. Since the adoption in 1960 of
the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
Peoples, more than 80 million people have achieved self-government through
independence, integration or free association. Nonetheless, 16 Non-Self-Governing
Territories remain and our efforts should continue to ensure that the Declaration is
implemented. Seminars such as this one organized by the Special Committee offer
the more than 2 million people who live in the Non-Self-Governing Territories a
chance to make their views known on the unique problems they face.

In recent years, the Committee has found new and creative ways to engage the
administering Powers in a dialogue on the future of the Territories. It has called for
programmes of work to be established on a case-by-case basis so that each Territory
can freely determine its status and strive towards political, social and economic
development. I urge all the administering Powers to seize this opportunity, in full
consultation with the Peoples of the Territories, to find appropriate arrangements for
the future in accordance with all relevant General Assembly resolutions.

There should be no room for colonialism in the twenty-first century. I
encourage you to do your utmost to close this chapter of history once and for all. In
that spirit, I would like to thank the Government of Fiji for its generosity in hosting
this event and wish you all a successful seminar.

69

A/57/23

Recalling the relevant resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly and
the Special Committee requesting the administering Powers to cooperate fully with
the United Nations by receiving visiting missions in the Territories under their
administration,

Mindful that United Nations visiting missions provide an effective means of
assessing the situation in those Territories and of ascertaining the wishes and
aspirations of the peoples thereof regarding their future status,

Conscious that United Nations visiting missions enhance the capacity of the
United Nations to assist the peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories in attaining
the objectives set forth in the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to
Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in General Assembly resolution 1514
(XV) of 14 December 1960, and in other relevant resolutions of the Assembly,

Noting with appreciation the continuing exemplary cooperation of New
Zealand, as an administering Power, in the work of the Special Committee, and that,
at the invitation of the Government of New Zealand, a visiting mission was
dispatched to Tokelau in July 1994,14

Recalling the dispatch in 1979 of a United Nations visiting mission to the
Territory of Guam, noting the recommendation of the 1996 Pacific Regional
Seminar that a visiting mission be sent to Guam, and taking note of resolution No.
464 (LS), adopted by the twenty-third Guam legislature on 19 July 1996, in which it
requested the dispatch of a United Nations visiting mission to that Territory,

Welcoming the commencement of informal dialogue between the Special
Committee and some administering Powers,

1. Stresses the need to dispatch periodic visiting missions to Non-Self-
Governing Territories in order to facilitate the full, speedy and effective
implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples with respect to those Territories;

2. Calls upon the administering Powers to cooperate or continue to
cooperate with the United Nations by receiving United Nations visiting missions in
the Territories under their administration;

3. Requests the administering Powers to consider new approaches in the
work of the Special Committee, and urges them to cooperate with the Special
Committee in its efforts;

4. Requests its Chairman to continue consultations with the administering
Powers concerned and to report thereon to the Special Committee as appropriate;

5. Also requests its Chairman to enter into consultations with the
administering Power of Guam with a view to facilitating the dispatch of a United
Nations visiting mission to that Territory to coincide with the proposed plebiscite to
be conducted by the Guam Electoral Commission on or about 7 September 2002.

Having considered the question of Tokelau,

Having examined the chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the
Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of

Recalling the solemn declaration on the future status of Tokelau, delivered by
the Ulu-o-Tokelau (the highest authority on Tokelau) on 30 July 1994, which states
that an act of self-determination in Tokelau is now under active consideration,
together with the constitution of a self-governing Tokelau, and that the present
preference of Tokelau is for a status of free association with New Zealand,

Recalling also its resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, containing the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, and

Noting also with appreciation the collaborative contribution to the
development of Tokelau by New Zealand and the specialized agencies and other
organizations of the United Nations system, in particular the United Nations
Development Programme and the World Health Organization,

Recalling the dispatch in 1994 of a United Nations visiting mission to Tokelau,

Noting that, as a small island Territory, Tokelau exemplifies the situation of
most remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories,

Noting also that, as a case study pointing to successful decolonization, Tokelau
has wider significance for the United Nations as it seeks to complete its work in
decolonization,

1. Notes that Tokelau remains firmly committed to the development of self-
government and to an act of self-determination that would result in Tokelau
assuming a status in accordance with the options on future status for Non-Self-
Governing Territories contained in principle VI of the annex to General Assembly
resolution 1541 (XV) of 15 December 1960;

2. Also notes the desire of Tokelau to move at its own pace towards an act

3. Further notes the inauguration in 1999 of a national Government based

leadership, and its wish to provide that leadership with the necessary support to
carry out its functions in the contemporary world;

governance and economic development dimensions, is seen by its people as the
means to achieving their act of self-determination;

6. Further acknowledges Tokelau’s initiative in devising a strategic
economic development plan for the period 2002 to 2004 in order to advance its
capacity for self-government;

leaders and the principles of the Modern House of Tokelau, Tokelau has established

as from 30 June 2001;

8. Welcomes the initiation of the dialogue with the administering Power and

Tokelau, and that both have national and international importance for Tokelau;

11. Acknowledges Tokelau’s need for continued reassurance given the
cultural adjustments that are taking place with the strengthening of its capacity for
self-government and, given that local resources cannot adequately cover the material
side of self-determination, the ongoing responsibility of Tokelau’s external partners
to assist Tokelau in balancing its desire to be self-reliant to the greatest extent
possible with its need for external assistance;

12. Notes the special challenge inherent in the situation of Tokelau, among

meeting of that challenge in innovative ways;

principle of self-determination as enunciated by the General Assembly in its
resolutions 1514 (XV), 1541 (XV) and other resolutions,

Welcoming the stated position of the Government of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland that it continues to take seriously its obligations
under the Charter to develop self-government in the dependent Territories and, in
cooperation with the locally elected Governments, to ensure that their constitutional
frameworks continue to meet the wishes of the people, and the emphasis that it is
ultimately for the peoples of the Territories to decide their future status,

Welcoming also the stated position of the Government of the United States of
America that it supports fully the principles of decolonization and takes seriously its
obligations under the Charter to promote to the utmost the well-being of the
inhabitants of the Territories under United States administration,

Aware of the special circumstances of the geographical location and economic
conditions of each Territory, and bearing in mind the necessity of promoting
economic stability and diversifying and strengthening further the economies of the
respective Territories as a matter of priority,

Conscious of the particular vulnerability of the Territories to natural disasters
and environmental degradation and, in this connection, bearing in mind the
programmes of action of the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development, the World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction, the Global
Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, the
International Conference on Population and Development, the United Nations
Conference on Human Settlements, and other relevant world conferences,

Aware of the usefulness both to the Territories and to the Special Committee of
the participation of appointed and elected representatives of the Territories in the
work of the Special Committee,

Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories
should continue to guide the development of their future political status and that
referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an
important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,

Convinced also that any negotiations to determine the status of a Territory
must not take place without the active involvement and participation of the people
of that Territory, and that the views of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing
Territories in respect of their right to self-determination should be ascertained under
the supervision of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis,

representatives of the Territories, as well as Governments and organizations in the
region, in order to review the political, economic and social conditions in the
Territories,

Mindful further that in order for it to enhance its understanding of the political
status of the peoples of the Territories and to fulfil its mandate effectively, it is
important for the Special Committee to be apprised by the administering Powers and
to receive information from other appropriate sources, including the representatives
of the Territories, concerning the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the
Territories,

Recognizing the need for the Special Committee actively to embark on a public
awareness campaign aimed at assisting the peoples of the Territories in gaining an
understanding of the options of self-determination,

Mindful in this connection that the holding of regional seminars in the
Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters and other venues, with the active
participation of representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a
helpful means for the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate, and that the regional
nature of the seminars, alternating between the Caribbean and Pacific, is a crucial
element in their success, while recognizing the need for reviewing the role of those
seminars in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political
status of the Territories,

Mindful also that some Territories have not had any United Nations visiting
mission for a long period of time and that no such visiting missions have been sent
to some of the Territories,

Territories by specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations

Committee at its 10th meeting, on 26 June 2002, appears below in the form of a
recommendation of the Special Committee to the General Assembly.

Draft decision
Military activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in
Territories under their administration

1. The General Assembly, having considered the chapter of the report of the
Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples
relating to an item on the agenda of the Special Committee entitled “Military
activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their
administration”30 and recalling its resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 and
all other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations relating to military
activities in colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories, reaffirms its strong
conviction that military bases and installations in the Territories concerned could
constitute an obstacle to the exercise by the people of those Territories of their right
to self-determination, and reiterates its strong views that existing bases and
installations, which are impeding the implementation of the Declaration on the
Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, should be withdrawn.

2. Aware of the presence of such bases and installations in some of those
Territories, the General Assembly urges the administering Powers concerned to

__________________

115

A/57/23

continue to take all necessary measures not to involve those Territories in any
offensive acts or interference against other States.

3. The General Assembly reiterates its concern that military activities and
arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their administration might run
counter to the rights and interests of the colonial peoples concerned, especially their
right to self-determination and independence. The Committee once again calls upon
the administering Powers concerned to terminate such activities and to eliminate
such military bases in compliance with the relevant resolutions of the General
Assembly. Alternative sources of livelihood for the peoples of the Non-Self-
Governing Territories should be provided.

4. The General Assembly reiterates that the colonial and Non-Self-
Governing Territories and areas adjacent thereto should not be used for nuclear
testing, dumping of nuclear wastes or deployment of nuclear and other weapons of
mass destruction.

5. The General Assembly deplores the continued alienation of land in
colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories, particularly in the small island
Territories of the Pacific and Caribbean regions, for military installations. The large-
scale utilization of the local resources for this purpose could adversely affect the
economic development of the Territories concerned.

6. The General Assembly takes note of the decision of some of the
administering Powers to close or downsize some of those military bases in the Non-
Self-Governing Territories.

7. The General Assembly requests the Secretary-General to continue to
inform world public opinion of those military activities and arrangements in colonial
and Non-Self-Governing Territories which constitute an obstacle to the
implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples.

8. The General Assembly requests the Special Committee on the Situation
with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples to continue to examine this
question and report thereon to the Assembly at its fifty-eighth session.
