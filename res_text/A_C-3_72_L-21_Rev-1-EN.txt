children or other national institutions for the promotion and protection of the rights 

of the child,  

 Recognizing that the family has the primary responsibility for the nurturing 

and protection of children, in the best interests of the child, and that children, for the 

full and harmonious development of their personality, should grow up in a family 

environment and in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding,  

 Noting with appreciation the work to promote and protect the rights of the 

child carried out by all relevant organs, bodies, entities and organizations of the 

United Nations system, within their respective mandates,  by relevant mandate 

holders and special procedures of the United Nations and by relevant regional 

organizations, where appropriate, and intergovernmental organizations, and 

recognizing the valuable role of national human rights institutions and civil soci ety, 

including non-governmental organizations,  

 Noting the convening of international, regional and national meetings aimed at 

eliminating all forms of violence against children, including all violent punishment 

of children, and encouraging additional efforts in this regard, 

 Recognizing the importance of international, regional and bilateral 

multi-stakeholder partnerships and initiatives to advance the effective protection 

and promotion of the rights of the child and the elimination of violence against 

children, and in this regard takes note, inter alia, of the Global Partnership to End 

Violence Against Children, the “High time to end violence against children” 

initiative, the Together for Girls partnership, the Global Alliance to Eradicate 

Forced Labour, Modern Slavery, Human Trafficking and Child Labour, the Global 

Youth Partnership for the Sustainable Development Goals, the Global Partnership 

on Children with Disabilities, the Global Coalition to Protect Education from 

Attack, the WeProtect Global Alliance to combat online child sexual exploitation 

and the Global Alliance for Reporting Progress on Promoting Peaceful, Just and 

Inclusive Societies, 

 Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world 

remains critical, in an increasingly globalized environment, as a result of the 

persistence of poverty, social inequality, inadequate social and economic conditions, 

pandemics, in particular HIV/AIDS, malaria, cholera and tuberculosis, fetal alcohol 

syndrome and inherited addictions, non-communicable diseases, lack of access to 

safe drinking water and sanitation, environmental damage, climate change, natural 

disasters, armed conflict, foreign occupation, displacement, famine, violence, 

terrorism, abuse, all forms of exploitation, including the commercial sexual 

exploitation of children, such as for purposes of child prostitution, child 

pornography and other child sexual abuse material, child sex tourism and sexual 

exploitation of children in travel, and trafficking in children, including  for purposes 

of labour and sexual exploitation, organ removal and the transfer of organs of the 

child for profit, neglect, illiteracy, hunger, intolerance, discrimination, racism, 

xenophobia, gender inequality, inadequate protection and inadequate access to 

justice, and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is 

called for,  

 Profoundly concerned also that the situation of children in many parts of the 

world remains negatively affected by the prolonged effects of the world financial 

and economic crisis, poverty and inequality, reaffirming that eradicating poverty in 

all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global 

challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, 

recognizing its impact beyond the socioeconomic context and the intrinsic 

interlinkage between poverty eradication and the promotion of sustainable 

development, in this regard underlining the importance of the implementation of the 



 
A/C.3/72/L.21/Rev.1 

 

5/16 17-20130 

 

2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and recognizing that a strong focus is 

needed on poverty, deprivation and inequality to prevent and protect children from 

all forms of violence and to promote the resilience of children, their families and 

their communities,  

 Profoundly concerned further that children in many parts of the world remain 

negatively affected by the impacts of climate change, including persistent drought 

and extreme weather events, land degradation, sea level rise, coastal erosion and 

ocean acidification, which further threaten health, food security and efforts to 

eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development, and in this regard 

underlines the importance of the implementation of the Paris Agreement
36

 adopted 

under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 

 Expressing deep concern that, despite the recognition of the right of the child 

to express her or his views freely on all matters affecting her or him, with her or his 

views given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child, 

children are still seldom seriously consulted and involved in such matters owing to a 

variety of constraints and impediments and that the full implementation of this right 

has yet to be fully realized,  

 Deeply concerned that children disproportionately suffer the consequences of 

discrimination, exclusion, inequality and poverty,  

 Deeply concerned also that approximately 5.6 million children under the age 

of 5 die each year,
37

 mostly from preventable and treatable causes, owing to 

inadequate or lack of access to integrated and quality sexual, reproductive and 

maternal health-care services, as well as newborn and child health care and services, 

early childbearing and lack of access to health determinants, such as safe drinking 

water and sanitation, safe and adequate food and nutrition, including breastfeeding, 

and that mortality remains highest among children belonging to the poorest and 

most marginalized communities,  

 Recognizing that the risk of maternal mortality is highest for girls under 15 

years of age and that complications in pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause 

of death among girls under 15 years of age in many countries,  

 Expressing concern that children with disabilities face stigmatization, 

discrimination or exclusion and are disproportionately subjected to mental and 

physical violence and sexual abuse in all settings, including families, schools and 

private and public institutions,  

 

I 

 Implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional 

Protocols thereto 
 

 1. Reaffirms paragraphs 1 to 5 of its resolution 71/177 and 1 to 10 of its 

resolution 68/147 of 18 December 2013, urges States that have not yet done so to 

consider acceding to the Convention on the Rights of the Child
1
 and to the Optional 

Protocols thereto
2
 as a matter of priority and to implement them effectively and 

fully, and encourages further efforts by the Secretary-General in this regard;  

 2. Urges States parties to withdraw reservations that are incompatible with 

the object and purpose of the Convention or the Optional Protocols thereto and to 

consider reviewing regularly other reservations with a view to withdrawing them in 

accordance with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action;

with their obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child  to preserve 

the identity of children, including their nationality, name and family relations, as 

recognized by law, to protect children in matters relating to birth registration, family 

relations and adoption or other forms of alternative care, recognizing that every 

effort should be directed to enabling children to remain in or swiftly return to the 

care of their parents or, when appropriate, other close family members and that, 

where alternative care is necessary, family and community-based care should be 

promoted over placement in institutions;  

 5.  Calls upon States to take all measures necessary to prevent and combat 

illegal adoptions and all adoptions that are not in the best interest of the child;  

 

  Economic and social well-being of children 
 

 6. Reaffirms paragraphs 13 to 15 of its resolution 71/177 and 20 to 29 of its 

resolution 68/147, calls upon all States and the international community to create an 

enabling environment in which the well-being of the child is ensured, including by 

strengthening international cooperation in this field and by implementing their 

commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals, reaffirms that 

investment in children, especially for early childhood development, has high 

economic and social returns and that all related efforts to ensure that resources 

allocated and spent for children, especially on children’s education and health, 

should serve as a means for the fulfilment of the rights of the child, and notes in this 

regard general comment No. 19 (2016) of the Committee on the Rights of the Child 

on public budgeting for the realization of children’s rights;
38

 

 

  Child labour 
 

 7. Reaffirms paragraphs 16 to 18 of its resolution 71/177 and 30 to 33 of its 

resolution 68/147, urges States to take immediate and effective measures to secure 

the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour and to end child 

labour in all its forms, by 2025 at the latest, and to promote education as a key 

strategy, in this regard notes the convening of the Global Conference on the 

Sustained Eradication of Child Labour in Buenos Aires from 14 to 16 November 

2017, and urges States to continue to promote the engagement of all sectors of 

society in creating an enabling environment for the eradication of child labour;
