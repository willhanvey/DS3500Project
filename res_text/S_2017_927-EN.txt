out the legal framework applicable to activities in the ocean, including countering 

piracy and armed robbery at sea, 

 Recognizing the need to investigate and prosecute not only suspects captured 

at sea, but also anyone who incites or intentionally facilitates piracy operations, 

including key figures of criminal networks involved in piracy who plan, organize, 

facilitate, or illicitly finance or profit from such attacks, and reiterating its concern 

over persons suspected of piracy having been released without facing justice,

armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia undermines anti -piracy efforts, 

 Welcoming the successful prosecution of piracy cases in Belgium, India, 

Mauritius, and the Seychelles during the past year, while noting with concern that 

the continuing limited capacity and domestic legislation to facilitate the custody and 

prosecution of suspected pirates after their capture has hindered more robust 

international action against pirates off the coast of Somalia, which has led to pirates 

in many cases being released without facing justice, regardless of whether there is 

sufficient evidence to support prosecution, and reiterating that, consistent with  the 

provisions of The Convention concerning the repression of piracy, the 1988 

Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime 

Navigation (“SUA Convention”) provides for parties to create criminal offences, 

establish jurisdiction, and accept delivery of persons responsible for, or suspected of 

seizing, or exercising control over, a ship by force or threat thereof, or any other 

form of intimidation, 

 Underlining the primary responsibility of the Somali authorities in the fight  

against piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, noting the several

appreciation of Somali authorities to the Security Council for its assistance, 

expressing their willingness to consider working with other States and regional 

organizations to combat piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, 

asking member states and international organizations to support the Federal 

Government of Somalia in its efforts to address illegal, unreported, and unregulated 

fishing in its Exclusive Economic Zone, and requesting that the provisions of 

resolution 2316 (2016) be renewed for an additional 12 months,  

 Welcoming the participation of the Federal Government of Somalia and 

regional partners in the 20th plenary session of the Contact Group on Piracy off the

Ocean Commission under the Chairmanship of the Republic of the Seychelles,  

 Recognizing the work of the CGPCS and the Law Enforcement Task Force to 

facilitate the prosecution of suspected pirates, and the intentions of the Regional 

Capacity Building Working Group to identify regional priorities and coordination of 

capacity-building activities and regional responsibilities,  

 Welcoming the financing provided by the Trust Fund to Support Initiatives of 

States Combating Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (the Trust Fund) to strengthen 

regional ability to prosecute suspected pirates and imprison those convicted in 

accordance with applicable international human rights law, noting with appreciation 

the assistance provided by the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC)

Shared Awareness and Deconfliction Initiative (SHADE) and the efforts of 

individual countries, including China, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Japan, the 

Republic of Korea, and the Russian Federation, which have deployed naval 

counter-piracy missions in the region, 

 Noting the efforts of flag States for taking measures to permit vessels sailing 

under their flag transiting the High Risk Area (HRA) to embark vessel protection 

detachments and privately contracted armed security personnel (PCASP), and to 

allow charters that favour arrangements that make use of such measures, while 

urging States to regulate such activities in accordance with applicable international 

law, 

 Welcoming and encouraging the capacity-building efforts in the region made

by the IMO and the shipping industry to develop and update guidance, best 

management practices, and recommendations to assist ships to prevent and suppress 

piracy attacks off the coast of Somalia, including in the Gulf of Aden, and in 

relevant parts of the Indian Ocean that are still within the High Risk Area and 

recognizing the work of the IMO and the CGPCS in this regard, noting the efforts of 

the International Organization for Standardization, which has developed industry 

standards of training and certification for Private Maritime Security Companies 

when providing PCASP on board ships in high-risk areas, and further welcoming 

the European Union’s EUCAP Somalia, which is working to develop the maritime 

security capacities of Somalia, 

 Underlining the importance of continuing to enhance the collection, 

preservation, and transmission to competent authorities of evidence of acts of piracy 

and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, and welcoming the ongoing work 

of the IMO, INTERPOL, and industry groups to develop guidance to seafarers on 

preservation of crime scenes following acts of piracy, and noting the importance of 

enabling seafarers to give evidence in criminal proceedings to prosecute acts of 

piracy, 

 Further recognizing that pirate networks continue to rely on kidnapping and 

hostage-taking to help generate funding to purchase weapons, gain recruits, and 

continue their operational activities, thereby jeopardizing the safety and security of 

civilians and restricting the flow of commerce, and welcoming international efforts 

to coordinate the work of investigators and prosecutors, inter alia, through the Law 

Enforcement Task Force and collect and share information to disrupt the pirate 

enterprise, as exemplified by INTERPOL’s Global Database on Maritime Piracy, 

and commending the establishment of the Regional Centre for Operational

by pirates operating off the coast of Somalia, expressing serious concern at the 

inhumane conditions hostages face in captivity, recognizing the adverse impact on 

their families, calling for the immediate release of all remaining hostages, and 

noting the importance of cooperation between Member States on the issue of 

hostage-taking and the prosecution of suspected pirates for taking hostages,  

 Commending Kenya, Mauritius, Tanzania, and Seychelles, for their efforts to 

prosecute suspected pirates in their national courts, and noting with appreciation the 

assistance provided by the UNODC Maritime Crime Programme, the Trust Fund, 

and other international organizations and donors, in coordination with the CGPCS, 

to support Kenya, Mauritius, Seychelles, Tanzania, Somalia, and other States in the 

region with their efforts to prosecute, or incarcerate in a third State after prosecution 

elsewhere, pirates, including facilitators and financiers ashore, consistent with 

applicable international human rights law, and emphasizing the need for States and 

international organizations to further enhance international efforts in this regard,  

 Welcoming the readiness of the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal
