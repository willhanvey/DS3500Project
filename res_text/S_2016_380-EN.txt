 The Security Council, 

 Reiterating its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international 

peace and security and, in this context, the need to promote and ensure respect for 

the principles and rules of international humanitarian law,  

 Recalling all relevant Security Council resolutions, including resolutions 2175 

(2014) and 1502 (2003) on the protection of humanitarian personnel, resolutions 

1265 (1999), 1296 (2000), 1674 (2006), 1738 (2006), 1894 (2009) and 2222 (2015) 

on the protection of civilians in armed conflict, resolutions 1539 (2004) and 1612 

(2005) relating to the establishment of a monitoring and reporting mechanism on 

children and armed conflict, and resolution 1998 (2011) on attacks against schools 

and/or hospitals, as well as relevant statements of its President related to the 

protection of civilians in armed conflict and to the protection of medical personnel 

and humanitarian personnel in conflict zones,  

 Recalling all relevant General Assembly resolutions, including resolution 

70/104 entitled Safety and security of humanitarian personnel and protection of 

United Nations personnel, 70/106 entitled Strengthening of the coordination of 

emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations, and 69/132 entitled 

Global health and foreign policy,  

 Recalling the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Additional Protocols of 

1977 and 2005, as applicable, as well as relevant customary international law 

concerned with the protection of the wounded and sick, medical personnel and 

humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means of 

transport and equipment, as well as hospitals and other medical facilities, and the 



S/2016/380 
 

 

16-07215 2/5 

 

obligation of parties to armed conflict to respect and ensure respect for international 

humanitarian law in all circumstances,  

 Recalling the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated 

Personnel, and its Optional Protocol,  

 Recognizing the particular challenges faced by humanitarian personnel 

exclusively engaged in medical duties and medical personnel and reaffirming that 

all humanitarian personnel are entitled to respect and protection under international 

humanitarian law, 

 Stressing that identification of medical personnel and humanitarian personnel 

exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means of transport and equipment, as 

well as hospitals and other medical facilities may enhance their protection, and in 

this regard, recalling also the obligations, in situations of armed conflict, pertaining 

to the use and the protection of the distinctive emblems under the Geneva 

Conventions of 1949 and where applicable, their Additional Protocols,  

 Recalling further the specific obligations under international humanitarian law 

to respect and protect, in situations of armed conflict, medical personnel and 

humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means of 

transport and equipment, and hospitals and other medical facilities, which must not 

be attacked, and to ensure that the wounded and sick receive, to the fullest extent 

practicable and with the least possible delay, the medical care and attention 

required,  

 Recalling also the obligation under international humanitarian law to 

distinguish between civilian populations and combatants, and the prohibition against 

indiscriminate attacks, and the obligations to do everything feasible to verify that 

the objectives to be attacked are neither civilians nor civilian objects and are not 

subject to special protection, including medical personnel their means of transport 

and equipment, and hospitals and other medical facilities, and recalling further the 

obligation to take all feasible precautions with a view to avoiding and in any event 

minimizing harm to civilians and civilian objects,  

 Deeply concerned that despite these obligations, acts of violence, attacks and 

threats against medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged 

in medical duties, their means of transport and equipment, as well as hospitals and 

other medical facilities, are being perpetrated in situations of armed conflicts and 

that the number of such acts is increasing,  

 Recalling that locally recruited medical personnel and humanitarian personnel 

exclusively engaged in medical duties account for the majority of casualties among 

such personnel in situations of armed conflict,  

 Further concerned that the delivery of humanitarian assistance, including 

medical assistance, to populations in need is being obstructed by parties to armed 

conflicts in many conflict situations,  

 Recalling that under international humanitarian law, persons engaged in 

medical activities shall not be compelled to perform acts or to carry out work 

contrary to the rules of medical ethics or to other medical rules designed for the 

benefit of the wounded and the sick,  



 
S/2016/380 

 

3/5 16-07215 

 

 Convinced that acts of violence, attacks and threats against medical personnel 

and humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means of 

transport and equipment, as well as hospitals and other medical facilities, and 

obstructing the delivery of humanitarian assistance, including medical assistance, 

may exacerbate ongoing armed conflicts and undermine the efforts of the Security 

Council to maintain international peace and security under the Charter of the United 

Nations,  

 Reaffirming the need for all parties to armed conflict to respect the 

humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence in 

the provision of humanitarian assistance, including medical assistance, and 

reaffirming also the need for all actors engaged in the provision of such assistance 

in situations of armed conflict to promote and fully respect these principles,  

 Urging States to ensure that violations of international humanitarian law 

related to the protection of the wounded and sick, medical personnel and 

humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means of 

transport and equipment, as well as hospitals and other medical facilities in armed 

conflicts do not remain unpunished, affirming the need for States to ensure that 

those responsible do not operate with impunity, and that they are brought to justice, 

as provided for by national laws and obligations under international law,  

 Recalling that, under international law, attacks intentionally directed against 

hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected, provided that they 

are not military objectives, as well as attacks intentionally directed against 

buildings, material, medical units and transport and personnel using the distinctive 

emblems of the Geneva Conventions in conformity with international law are war 

crimes,  

 Stressing that the fight against impunity and to ensure accountability for war 

crimes and other serious violations of international humanitarian law has been 

strengthened through the work on and prosecution of these crimes in the 

international criminal justice system, and in this regard reiterating the importance of 

State cooperation with international courts and tribunals in accordance with States’ 

respective obligations,  

 Noting that medical personnel, and humanitarian personnel exclusively 

engaged in medical duties, in an armed conflict situation, continue to be under a 

duty to provide competent medical service in full professional and moral 

independence, with compassion and respect for human dignity, and always to bear 

in mind human life and to act in the patient’s best interest and stressing the need to 

uphold their respective professional codes of ethics, and further noting the 

applicable rules of international humanitarian law relating to the non-punishment of 

any person for carrying out medical activities compatible with medical ethics,  

 Reaffirming the primary responsibility of States to protect the population 

throughout their whole territory and recalling in this regard that all parties to armed 

conflict must comply fully with the obligations applicable to them under 

international humanitarian law related to the protection of civilians in armed 

conflict and medical personnel,  

 1. Strongly condemns acts of violence, attacks and threats against the 

wounded and sick, medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively 

engaged in medical duties, their means of transport and equipment, as well as 



S/2016/380 
 

 

16-07215 4/5 

 

hospitals and other medical facilities, and deplores the long-term consequences of 

such attacks for the civilian population and the healthcare systems of the countries 

concerned;  

 2. Demands that all parties to armed conflicts fully comply with their 

obligations under international law, including international human rights law, as 

applicable, and international humanitarian law, in particular their obligations under 

the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the obligations applicable to them under the 

Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 and 2005, to ensure the respect and protection 

of all medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical 

duties, their means of transport and equipment, as well as hospitals and other 

medical facilities;  

 3. Demands that all parties to armed conflicts facilitate safe and unimpeded 

passage for medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in 

medical duties, their equipment, transport and supplies, including surgical items, to 

all people in need, consistent with international humanitarian law;  

 4. Strongly urges States and all parties to armed conflict to develop 

effective measures to prevent and address acts of violence, attacks and threats 

against medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in 

medical duties, their means of transport and equipment, as well as hospitals and 

other medical facilities in armed conflict, including, as appropriate, through the 

development of domestic legal frameworks to ensure respect for their relevant 

international legal obligations, the collection of data on obstruc tion, threats and 

physical attacks on medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively 

engaged in medical duties, their means of transport and medical facilities, and to 

share challenges and good practice in this regard;  

 5. Underlines the important role that education and training in international 

humanitarian law can play in supporting efforts to halt and prevent acts of violence, 

attacks and threats against the wounded and sick, medical personnel and 

humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means of 

transport and equipment, as well as hospitals and other medical facilities;  

 6. Calls upon States to ensure that their armed forces and security forces, 

within their respective competencies under domestic law, make or, where relevant, 

continue their efforts to integrate practical measures for the protection of the 

wounded and sick and medical services into the planning and conduct of their 

operations;  

 7. Emphasizes the responsibility of States to comply with the relevant 

obligations under international law to end impunity and to ensure those responsible 

for serious violations of international humanitarian law are held to account;  

 8. Strongly condemns the prevailing impunity for violations and abuses 

committed against medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively 

engaged in medical duties, their means of transport and equipment, as well as 

hospitals and other medical facilities in armed conflict, which in turn may 

contribute to the recurrence of these acts;  

 9. Strongly urges States to conduct, in an independent manner, full, prompt, 

impartial and effective investigations within their jurisdiction of violations of 

international humanitarian law related to the protection of the wounded and sick, 



 
S/2016/380 

 

5/5 16-07215 

 

medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical 

duties, their means of transport and equipment, as well as hospitals and other 

medical facilities in armed conflict, and, where appropriate, take action against 

those responsible in accordance with domestic and international law, with a view to 

reinforcing preventive measures, ensuring accountability and addressing the 

grievances of victims;  

 10. Expresses its intention to ensure that the mandates of relevant United 

Nations peacekeeping operations can, where appropriate and on a case-by-case 

basis, help to contribute to a secure environment to enable the delivery of medical 

assistance, in accordance with humanitarian principles;  

 11. Encourages the Secretary-General, in accordance with his prerogatives 

under the Charter of the United Nations, to bring to the attention of the Security 

Council situations in which the delivery of medical assistance to populations in need 

is being obstructed by parties to the armed conflict;  

 12. Requests the Secretary-General to include in his country-specific 

situation reports, and other relevant reports which address the protection of 

civilians, the issue of the protection of the wounded and sick, medical personnel and 

humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means of 

transport and equipment, as well as hospitals and other medical facilities, including 

recording specific acts of violence against them, remedial actions taken by parties to 

the armed conflict and other relevant actors, including humanitarian agencies, to 

prevent similar incidents, and actions taken to identify and hold accountable those 

who commit such acts;  

 13. Further requests the Secretary-General to promptly provide the Security 

Council with recommendations on measures to prevent incidents of the kind 

described in the above paragraph and to better ensure accountability and enhance 

the protection of the wounded and sick and medical personnel and humanitarian 

personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means of transport and 

equipment, as well as hospitals and other medical facilities;  

 14. Further requests the Secretary-General to brief the Security Council
