Ireland and United States of America: draft resolution

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its previous resolutions on Iraq, including resolution 1483 (2003)
of 22 May 2003 and 1500 (2003) of 14 August 2003, and on threats to peace and
security caused by terrorist acts, including resolution 1373 (2001) of 28 September
2001, and other relevant resolutions,

Underscoring that the sovereignty of Iraq resides in the State of Iraq,
reaffirming the right of the Iraqi people freely to determine their own political future
and control their own natural resources, reiterating its resolve that the day when
Iraqis govern themselves must come quickly, and recognizing the importance of
international support, particularly that of countries in the region, Iraq’s neighbours,
and regional organizations, in taking forward this process expeditiously,

Recognizing that international support for restoration of conditions of stability
and security is essential to the well-being of the people of Iraq as well as to the
ability of all concerned to carry out their work on behalf of the people of Iraq, and
welcoming Member State contributions in this regard under resolution 1483 (2003),

Welcoming the decision of the Governing Council of Iraq to form a preparatory
constitutional committee to prepare for a constitutional conference that will draft a
constitution to embody the aspirations of the Iraqi people, and urging it to complete
this process quickly,

Affirming that the terrorist bombings of the Embassy of Jordan on 7 August
2003, of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad on 19 August 2003, of the
Imam Ali Mosque in Najaf on 29 August 2003, and of the Embassy of Turkey on 14
October 2003, and the murder of a Spanish diplomat on 9 October 2003 are attacks
on the people of Iraq, the United Nations, and the international community, and
deploring the assassination of Dr. Akila al-Hashimi, who died on 25 September
2003, as an attack directed against the future of Iraq,

In that context, recalling and reaffirming the statement of its President of 20
August 2003 (S/PRST/2003/13) and resolution 1502 (2003) of 26 August 2003,

Determining that the situation in Iraq, although improved, continues to
