Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,4 and recalling in this regard General 
Assembly resolution ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004,  

 Convinced that occupation itself represents a gross and grave violation of 
human rights,  

 Gravely concerned about the continuing detrimental impact of the events that 
have taken place since 28 September 2000, including the excessive use of force by 
the Israeli occupying forces against Palestinian civilians, resulting in thousands of 
deaths and injuries, the widespread destruction of property and vital infrastructure 
and the internal displacement of civilians,  

 Having considered the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli 
Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of 
the Occupied Territories5 and the relevant reports of the Secretary-General,6 

 Recalling the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government 
Arrangements of 13 September 19937 and the subsequent implementation 
agreements between the Palestinian and Israeli sides,  

 Expressing the hope that the Israeli occupation will be brought to an early and 
complete end and that therefore the violation of the human rights of the Palestinian 
people will cease, and recalling in this regard its resolution 58/292 of 6 May 2004,  

 1. Commends the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices 
Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the 
Occupied Territories for its efforts in performing the tasks assigned to it by the 
General Assembly and for its impartiality;  

 2. Reiterates its demand that Israel, the occupying Power, cooperate, in 
accordance with its obligations as a State Member of the United Nations, with the 
Special Committee in implementing its mandate;  

 3. Deplores those policies and practices of Israel that violate the human 
rights of the Palestinian people and other Arabs of the occupied territories, as 
reflected in the report of the Special Committee covering the reporting period;5  

 4. Expresses grave concern about the critical situation in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, since 28 September 2000, as a result 
of unlawful Israeli practices and measures, and especially condemns all illegal 
Israeli settlement activities and the construction of the wall, as well as the excessive 
and indiscriminate use of force against the civilian population, including 
extrajudicial executions;  

 5. Requests the Special Committee, pending complete termination of the 
Israeli occupation, to continue to investigate Israeli policies and practices in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories 
occupied by Israel since 1967, especially Israeli violations of the Geneva 
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 
12 August 1949,1 and to consult, as appropriate, with the International Committee of 
the Red Cross according to its regulations in order to ensure that the welfare and

Territory, including East Jerusalem;

treatment of the thousands of prisoners and detainees in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied by Israel 
since 1967;

 (a) To provide the Special Committee with all necessary facilities, including 
those required for its visits to the occupied territories, so that it may investigate 
Israeli policies and practices referred to in the present resolution;  

 (b) To continue to make available such staff as may be necessary to assist the 
Special Committee in the performance of its tasks;

 (e) To report to the General Assembly at its sixty-third session on the tasks 
entrusted to him in the present resolution;
