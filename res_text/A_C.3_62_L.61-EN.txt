 The General Assembly, 

 Guided by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights,1 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,2 the

 Recalling the provisions of Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2004/16

 Recalling also the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal and the Judgement of

Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance on 8 September 2001,6 in 
particular paragraph 2 of the Declaration and paragraph 86 of the Programme of 
Action, 

 Recalling equally the study undertaken by the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance,7 and taking note of his report,8 

 Alarmed, in this regard, at the spread in many parts of the world of various 
extremist political parties, movements and groups, including neo-Nazis and 
skinhead groups, 

 1. Reaffirms the provision of the Durban Declaration6 in which States 
condemned the persistence and resurgence of neo-Nazism, neo-Fascism and violent 
nationalist ideologies based on racial and national prejudice and stated that those 
phenomena could never be justified in any instance or in any circumstances; 

 2. Expresses deep concern over the glorification of the Nazi movement and 
former members of the Waffen SS organization, including by erecting monuments 
and memorials as well as holding public demonstrations in the name of the 
glorification of the Nazi past, the Nazi movement and neo-Nazism; 

 3. Also expresses concern over recurring attempts to desecrate, demolish, 
remove or transfer monuments erected in remembrance of those who fought against 
Nazism during the Second World War, as well as to unlawfully exhume or remove 
the remains of such persons and urges States in this regard to fully comply with 
their relevant obligations, inter alia, under article 34 of Additional Protocol I to the 
Geneva Conventions of 1949;9 

 4. Notes with concern the increase in the number of racist incidents in 
several countries and the rise of skinhead groups, which have been responsible for 
many of these incidents, as well as the resurgence of racist and xenophobic violence 
targeting members of ethnic, religious or cultural communities and national 
minorities, as observed by the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in his latest report;10 

 5. Reaffirms that such acts may be qualified to fall within the scope of 
activities described in article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination,3 and that they may represent a clear and 
manifest abuse of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association as 
well as the rights to freedom of opinion and expression within the meaning of those 
rights as guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights2 and the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; 

 6. Stresses that the practices described above do injustice to the memory of 
the countless victims of crimes against humanity committed in the Second World 
War, in particular those committed by the SS organization, and poison the minds of 
young people, and that those practices are incompatible with the obligations of

States Members of the United Nations under its Charter and are incompatible with 
the goals and principles of the Organization; 

 7. Also stresses that such practices fuel contemporary forms of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and contribute to the 
spread and multiplication of various extremist political parties, movements and 
groups, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups; 

 8. Emphasizes the need to take the necessary measures to put an end to the 
practices described above, and calls upon States to take more effective measures in 
accordance with international human rights law to combat those phenomena and the 
extremist movements, which pose a real threat to democratic values; 

 9. Reaffirms that, according to article 4 of the International Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, States parties to that 
instrument are, inter alia, under the obligation: 

 (a) To condemn all propaganda and all organizations that are based on ideas 
of racial superiority or that attempt to justify or promote racial hatred and 
discrimination in any form; 

 (b) To undertake to adopt immediate and positive measures designed to 
eradicate all incitement to, or acts of, such discrimination with due regard to the 
principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights 
expressly set forth in article 5 of the Convention; 

 (c) To declare as an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas 
based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, as well as 
all acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of 
another colour or ethnic origin, and also the provision of any assistance to racist 
activities, including the financing thereof; 

 (d) To declare illegal and prohibit organizations and organized and all other 
propaganda activities that promote and incite racial discrimination and to recognize 
participation in such organizations or activities as an offence punishable by law; 

 (e) To prohibit public authorities or public institutions, national or local, 
from promoting or inciting racial discrimination; 

 10. Encourages those States that have made reservations to article 4 of the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
to give serious consideration to withdrawing such reservations as a matter of 
priority; 

 11. Recalls the request of the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 
2005/55 that the Special Rapporteur continue to reflect on this issue, make relevant 
recommendations in his future reports and seek and take into account in this regard 
the views of Governments and non-governmental organizations; 

 12. Urges Governments and non-governmental organizations to cooperate 
fully with the Special Rapporteur in the exercise of the aforementioned task; 

 13. Decides to remain seized of the issue.
