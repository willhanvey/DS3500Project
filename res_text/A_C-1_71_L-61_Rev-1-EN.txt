 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of chemical weapons, in 

particular resolution 70/41 of 7 December 2015, 

 Determined to achieve the effective prohibition of the development, 

production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and their 

destruction,

General of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to continue 

the mission to establish the facts surrounding the allegations of the use of toxic 

chemicals, reportedly chlorine, for hostile purposes in the Syrian Arab Republic, 

while stressing that the safety and security of mission personnel remains the top 

priority, 

 Recalling that, pursuant to Security Council resolution 2235 (2015) of

identify to the greatest extent feasible individuals, entities, groups or Governments 

that were perpetrators, organizers, sponsors or otherwise involved in the use of 

chemicals as weapons, including chlorine or any other toxic chemical, in the Syrian 

Arab Republic, where the fact-finding mission of the Organization for the 

Prohibition of Chemical Weapons determined that a specific incident in the Syrian 

Arab Republic involved or likely involved the use of chemicals as weapons,

 Reaffirming the importance of the outcome of the Third Special Session of the 

Conference of the States Parties to Review the Operation of the Chemical Weapons 

Convention, held in The Hague from 8 to 19 April 2013 (the Third Review 

Conference), including its consensus final report, in which the Conference 

addressed all aspects of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, 

Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Dest ruction
1
 

and made important recommendations on its continued implementation,  

 Emphasizing that the Third Review Conference welcomed the fact that the 

Convention is a unique multilateral agreement banning an entire category of 

weapons of mass destruction in a non-discriminatory and verifiable manner under strict 

and effective international control and noted with satisfaction that the Convention 

continues to be a remarkable success and an example of effective multilateralism,  

 Convinced that the Convention, 19 years after its entry into force, has 

reinforced its role as the international norm against chemical weapons, and that it 

constitutes a major contribution to:  

 (a) International peace and security,  

 (b) Eliminating chemical weapons and preventing their re-emergence, 

 (c) The ultimate objective of general and complete disarmament under strict 

and effective international control,  

 (d) Excluding completely, for the sake of all mankind, the possibility of the 

use of chemical weapons,

technical information in the field of chemical activities among States parties for 

peaceful purposes in order to enhance the economic and technological development 

of all States parties, 

 1. Condemns in the strongest possible terms the use of chemical weapons 

by anyone under any circumstances, emphasizing that any use of chemical weapons 

anywhere, at any time, by anyone, under any circumstances is unacceptable and is 

and would be a violation of international law, and expressing its strong conviction 

that those individuals responsible for the use of chemical weapons must and should 

be held accountable; 

 2. Also condemns in the strongest possible terms the use of chemical 

weapons as reported in the reports of the Joint Investigative Mechanism of the 

Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the United Nations of

further use of chemical weapons; 

 3. Emphasizes that the universality of the Convention on the Prohibition of

underlines the fact that the objectives of the Convention will not be fully realized as 

long as there remains even a single State not party to the Convention that could 

possess or acquire such weapons, and calls upon all States that have not yet done so 

to become parties to the Convention without delay;  

 4. Underlines the fact that the full, effective and non-discriminatory 

implementation of all articles of the Convention makes a major contribution to 

international peace and security through the elimination of existing stockpiles of 

chemical weapons and the prohibition of their acquisition and use, and provides for

and for international cooperation for peaceful purposes in the field of chemical 

activities;

destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles and the destruction or conversion of 

chemical weapons production facilities in accordance with the provisions of the 

Convention and the Annex on Implementation and Verification (Verification Annex) 

and under the verification of the Technical Secretariat of the Organization for the 

Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is essential for the realization of  the object and 

purpose of the Convention; 

 7. Stresses the importance to the Convention that all possessors of chemical 

weapons, chemical weapons production facilities or chemical weapons development 

facilities, including previously declared possessor States, should be among the 

States parties to the Convention, and welcomes progress to that end;  

 8. Recalls that the Third Special Session of the Conference of the States 

Parties to Review the Operation of the Chemical Weapons Convention expressed 

concern regarding the statement made by the Director General of the Organization 

for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in his report to the Executive Council of 

the Organization at its sixty-eighth session, provided in accordance with paragraph 2 

of decision C-16/DEC.11 of 1 December 2011 adopted by the Conference of the 

States Parties at its sixteenth session, that three possessor States parties, namely, 

Libya, the Russian Federation and the United States of America, had been unable to 

fully meet the final extended deadline of 29 April 2012 for the destruction of their 

chemical weapons stockpiles, and also expressed determination that the destruction 

of all categories of chemical weapons should be completed in the shortest time 

possible in accordance with the provisions of the Convention and the Verification 

Annex, and with the full application of the relevant decisions that have been taken;

26 August 2016 related to the detailed requirements for the destruction of Libya’s 

remaining category 2 chemical weapons and the destruction of these weapons 

outside the territory of Libya; 

 10. Notes with concern that, along with the threat of the possible production, 

acquisition and use of chemical weapons by States, the international community 

also faces the danger of the production, acquisition and use of chemical weapons by 

non-State actors, including terrorists, concerns which have highlighted the necessity 

of achieving universal adherence to the Convention, as well as the high level of 

readiness of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and stresses 

that the full and effective implementation of all provisions of the Convention, 

including those on national implementation (article VII) and assistance and 

protection (article X), constitutes an important contribution to the efforts of the 

United Nations in the global fight against terrorism in all its forms and 

manifestations;

General (EC-81/HP/DG.1) indicating the gaps, inconsistencies and discrepancies 

that remain with respect to chemical weapons facilities, activities, munitions and 

chemical materials and concluding that the Technical Secretariat is unable at present 

to verify fully that the declaration and related submissions of the Syrian Arab 

Republic are accurate and complete, as required by the Convention and Executive 

Council decision EC-M-33/DEC.1 of 27 September 2013, and also underscores the 

importance of such full verification;

their obligations under the Convention and to support the Organization for the 

Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in its implementation activities;  

 15. Welcomes progress made in the national implementation of article VII 

obligations, commends the States parties and the Technical Secretariat for assisting 

other States parties, on request, with the implementation of the follow -up to the plan 

of action regarding article VII obligations, and urges States parties that have not 

fulfilled their obligations under article VII to do so without further delay, in 

accordance with their constitutional processes;  

 16. Emphasizes the continuing relevance and importance of the provisions of 

article X of the Convention, welcomes the activities of the Organization for the
