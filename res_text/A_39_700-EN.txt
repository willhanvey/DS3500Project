bring to justice and punish speedily and effectively those responsible for the

Measures to be taken against Nazi, Fascist and neo-Fascist activities
and all other forms of totalitarian ideo1oqies and practices based on

racial intolerance, hatred and terror

The General Assembly,

Recalling that the United Nations emerged from the struggle against
nazism, fascism, aggression and foreign occupation, and that the peoples
expressed their resolve in the Charter of the United Nations to save future
generations from the scourge of war,

Bearing in mind the suffering, destruction and death of millions of
victims of aggression, foreign occupation, nazism and fascism,

Recalling also the close relationship between all totalitarian ideologies
and practices based on racial or ethnic exclusiveness or intolerance, hatred
and terror and systematic denial of human "rights and fundamental freedoms,

Considering that the fortieth ~nniversary of the victory over nazism and
fascism in the Second World War will occur in 1985 and should serve to
mobilize efforts of the world community in its struggle against Nazi, Fascist
and neo-Fascist and all other totalitarian ideologies and practices based on
racial intolerance, hatred and terror,

Reaffirming the purposes and principles laid down in the Charter, which
are aimed at maintaining international peace and security, developing friendly
relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and
self-determination of peoples, and achieving international co-operation in
promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms
for all,

Firmly convinced that the best bulwark against nazism and racial
discrimination is the establishment and maintenance of democratic
institutions, that the existence of genuine political, social and economic
democracy is an effective vaccine and an equally" effective antidote against
the formation or development of Nazi movements and that a political system

Emphasizing that all totalitarian or other ideoloqies and practices,
including Nazi, Fascist and neo-Fascist, based on racial or ethnic
exclusiveness or intolerance, hatred, terror, systematic denial of human
rights and fundamental freedoms, or which have such consequences, may
jeopardize world peace and constitute obstacles to friendly relations between
states and to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms,

AcknOWledging with satisfaction the fact that many States have
established systems based on the inherent dignity and the equal and
inalienable rights of all human beings, which are the basis of democratic
society and the best bulwark against totalitarian ideologies and practices,

Noting that, nevertheless, in the contemporary world there continue to
exist various forms of totalitarian ideologies and practices which entail
contempt for the individual or a denial of the intrinsic dignity and equality
of all human beings, of equality of opportunity in civil, political, economic,
social and cultural spheres, and of social justice,

Reaffirming that the prosecution and punishment of war crimes and crimes
against peace and humanity, as laid down in General Assembly resolutions 3 (I)

The General Assembly,

Guided by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, i!I the International Covenant on Civil
and political Rights~ and the humanitarian rules set out in the Geneva
Conventions of 12 August 1949 i!I and Additional Protocols I and 11

Recalling that, in its resolutions 35/192 of 15 December 1980, 36/155 of
16 December 1981, 37/135 of 17 December 1982 and 38/101 of 16 December 1983,
it expressed deep concern at the situation of human rights in El Salvador,

Bearing in mind Commission on Human Rights resolutions 32 (XXXVII) of
11 March 1981, 65/ in which the Commission decided to appoint a Special
Representative on the situation of human rights in El Salvador, 1982/28 of
11 March 1982, ~ 1983/29 of 8 March 1983 &11 and 1984/52 of
14 March 1984, ~ whereby the Commission extended the mandate of the special
Representative for another year and requested him to report, inter alia, to
the General Assembly,

Noting that the Special Representative of the Commission on Human Rights
points out in his interim report 69/ that, owing to the adoption of a new
government policy, the number of human riqhts violations has markedly
decreased, which is a welcome development, but that nevertheless a situation
of war and generalized violence continues to exist in El Salvador, that there
are still serious violations of human rights, that the number of attacks on
life and the economic structure remains a cause for concern and that the
capacity of the legal system to investigate and punish human rights violations
committed in the country continues to be patently inadequate,

Considering that there is an armed conflict not of an international
character in El Salvador in which the Government of that country and the
opposition forces are obligated to apply the minimum standard of protection of
human rights and of humane treatment set out in article 3 common to the
1949 Geneva Conventions as well as the Additional Protocol II of 1977,

Aware that a delicate process aiming at a political settlement has been
initiated in El Salvador, which could be hindered if arms or military
contributions of any other kind, making it possible to prolong or intensify
the war, are provided from outside,

Taking into account that the President of El Salvador stated before the
General Assembly that the main task of the mandate he was given by the
elections of 6 May 1984 is to achieve social harmony and internal peace in
El Salvador, and that the Special Representative notes with satisfaction the
obvious desire of the neW Government to establish a democracy governed by the
rule of law and guaranteeing full respect for human rights,

Recognizing that dialogue is the only way, in a spirit of generosity and
openness, to achieve a negotiated comprehensive political settlement that will
promote genuine national reconciliation, put an ead to the suffering of the
Salvadorian people and stem the growing tide of internal refugees and
displaced persons,

1. Commends the Special Representative for his interim report on the
situation of human rights in El Salvador~

2. Expresses its deep concern at the fact that, as indicated in the
report of the Special Representative, although the number of human rights
violatiolls has decreased, they are still serious and numerous, resulting in
suffering for the Salvadorian people)

3. Recalls that the right to life and liberty is paramount and
therefore notes with satisfaction the measures which, according to the report
of the Special Representative, the Government of El Salvador has adopted to
put an end to these serious violations of human rights)

4. Deeply regrets that the persistence of hostilities by the armed
forces of the Government has resulted in many civilian victims and material
damage, and also regrets that the hostilities of the guerrilla forces have on
occasion caused civilian victims and material damage to the economic
infrastructure of El Salvador,

5. Reaffirms once aqain the right of the Salvadorian people freely to
determine their political, economic and social future without interference
from outside, through a genuine democratic process, in an atmosphere free from
intimidation and terror)

6. Requests all States to refrain from intervening in the internal
situation in El Salvador and, instead of supplying arms or helping in any way
to prolong and intensify the war, to encourage the continuation of the
dialogue until a just and lasting peace is achieved)

1. Expresses satisfaction at the fact that, in accordance with the
appeal made by the President of El Salvador before the General Assembly and
the Assembly's own repeated appeals, talks were resumed between the Government
of El Salvador and the Frente Farabundo Mart! para la Liberacion
Naciona1-Frente Dernocratico Revo1ucionario, which confirmed its willingness in
that respect)

8. Recognizes that this dialogue is an important step in the process of
pacification and democratization of the country and therefore calls upon the
Government of El Salvador and the Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion
Nacional-Frente Democratico Revo1ucionario to intensify their talks until they
achieve a negotiated comprehensive political solution which will put an end to
the armed conflict and establish a lasting peace, which will allow the full
exercise both of civil and political rights and of economic, social and
cultural rights by all Salvadorians)

9. Welcomes the fact that the Government of El Salvador and the
insurgent forces have agreed through indirect talks to exchange prisoners of
war and allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to evacuate wounded
combatants of the opposition in exchange for the release of government
officials captured in combat, appeals to all States to do what they can to
support operations of that kind, and urges the Government of El Salvador and
the insurgent forces to continue those practices, which humanize the conflict,
and to agree as early as possible to respect the medical personnel and all
military hospitals, as required by the Geneva Conventions,

10. Again reiterat~s its appeal to the Government of El Salvador and to
the opposition forces to co-operate fully and not to interfere with the
activities of humanitarian organizations dedicated to alleviating the
suffering of the civilian population, wherever these organizations operate in
the country,

11. Recommends the continuation and deepening of the reforms necessary
in El Salvador, including effective application of agrarian reform, for the
solution of the economic and social problems which are the basic cause of the
internal conflict in that country,

12. DeeplY deplores the fact that the capacity of the jUdicial system in
El Salvador to investigate, prosecute and punish violations of human rights
continues to be patently inadequate and therefore urges the competent
authorities to continue and strengthen the process of reform of the
Salvadorian penal judicial system, in order to punish speedily and effectively
those responsible for the serious human rights violations which have been
committed and are still being committed in that country,

13. Calls upon the competent authorities in El Salvador to introduce
changes in the laws and other measures that are incompatible with the
provisions contained in the international instruments binding on the
GOvernment of El Salvador in respect of human rights,

14. Renews its appeal to the Government of El Salvador I as well as to
other part'ies concerned, to continue to co-operate with the Special
Representative of the Commission on Human Rights,

15. Decides to keep under consideration, during its fortieth session,
the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in El Salvador, in
order to examine this situation anew in the light of additional elements
provided by the Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and Social Council.

Situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Chile

The General Assembly,

'~ of its responsibility to promote and encourage respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms for all and determined to remain vigilant with
regard to violations of h~man rights wherever they occur,

Stressing the obligation of Governments to promote and protect human
rights and to carry out the responsibilities they have undertaken by virtue of
various international instruments,

Recalling its resolutions 3219 (XXIX) of 6 November 1974, 3448 (XXX) of
9 December 1975, 31/124 of 16 December 1976, 32/118 of 16 December 1977,

15 March 1984, 111 in which the Commission decided, inter alia, to extend for
a year the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights
in Chile,

Deploring once again the fact that the repeated app.eals of the General
Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and' other international organs to
re-establish human riqhts and fundamental freedoms have been ignored by the
Chilean authorities, which continue to refuse to co-operate with the
Commission on Human Rights and its Special Rapporteur,

Once again expressing its grave concern at the general persistence of the
serious situation of human rights in Chile, which, as established by the
Special Rapporteur, has continued to deteriorate, and that the Chilean
authorities have not been responsive to the concerns of the international
community, as expressed in resolutions of the General Assembly and the
Commission on Human Rights,

Observing that, according to the Special Rapporteur, the right to enter
and leave one's country freely is seriously restricted for Chilean citizens
and that this situation has been aggravated by the issuance of a list
containing the names of thousands of Chilean nationals who are not allowed to
enter their country without conditions,

Taking note with utmost concern of the re-establishment of the state of
siege on 6 ~ovember 1984, which has aggravated the situation of human rights
and fundamental freedoms in Chile, particularly by the increase in the number
of arbitrary mass arrests, of persons sent to internal exile and the practice
of torture and other forms of inhuman and degrading treatment as well as the
additional restrictions on the freedom of expression and information, assembly
and association,

1. Commends the Special Rapporteur for his report on the situation of
human rights in Chile 111 prepared in accordance with resolution 1984/63 of
15 March 1984 of the Commission on Human Riqhts,

2. Expresses its profound distress at the persistence of and increase in
serious and systematic violations of human riqhts in Chile, as described in
the report of the special Rapporteur, and, in particular at the violent
suppression of popular protest in the face of the refusal to restore the
democratic order and human rights and fundamental freedoms on the part of the
authorities, which have in fact committed further serious and flagrant
violations of human rights, with mass arrests and numerous deaths,

3. Reiterates once again its dismay at the disruption in Chile of the
traditional democratic legal order and its institutions, particularly through
the maintenance of emergency legislation, the institutionalization of states
of emergency, the extension of military jurisdiction and the existence of a
Constitution which does not reflect the will of the people freely expressed
and whose provisions not only fail to guarantee human rights and fundamental
freedoms, but suppress, suspend or limit their enjoyment and exercise,

4. Alarmed by the fact that the repressive activities of the police and
security agencies and, in particular, the National Information Agency continue
to go unpunished, as pointed out in the report of the Special Rapporteur,

S. Once again views with concern the ineffectiveness of the remedies of
habeas corpus or amparo and of protection, owing to the fact that the
judiciary does not exercise its power of investigation, monitoring and
supervision in this respe,ct and performs its functions under severe
restrictions}

6. Urges once more the Chilean authorities to restore and respect human
rights in accordance with the obligations they have assumed under various
international instruments and, in particular, to put an end to the regime of
exception and the practice of declaring states of emergency, under which
serious and continuing violations of human rights are committed, with the view
to the re-establishment of the principle of legality, the democratIc
institutions and the effective enjoyment and exercise of civil and political
rights and fundamental freedoms}

7. Urges the Chilean authorities to terminate the state of siege
decreed on 6 November 1984 and the cons,equences of that state of siege)

8. Once more urges the Chilean authorities to investigate and clarify
the fate of persons who have been arrested for political reasons and who later
disappeared and to inform their families of the results of such investigation
and to bring to trial and punish those responsible for their disappearanceJ

9. Once again draws the attention of the Chilean authorities to the
need to put an end to intimidation and persecution, as well as arbitrary or
illeqal arrests and imprisonment in secret places, and to respect the right of
persons to life and physical integrity by halting the practice of torture and
other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment which, in some cases,
have resulted in unexplained deaths}

10. Once again urges the Chilean authorities in accordance with
article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1!1 to
respect the right of Chilean nationals to live in and freely enter and leave
their country, without restrictions or conditions of any kind, in particular,
to annul the "list" limiting the riqht of Chilean nat iona1s to enter the
country and other recent measures affecting other individuals, and to cease
the practice of "relegation" (assiqrunent of forced residence) and forced exile,

11. Renews its app!al to the Chilean authorities to restore the full
enjoyment and exercise of trade union rights, in particular the right to
organize trade unions, the right to collective bargai.ning and the right to
strike, and to put an end to the system of repressing the activities of
trade-union leaders and their organizations)

necessary, restore economic, social and cultural rights and, in particular,
the rights intended to preserve the cultural identity and improve the social
status of indigenous populations, including the leg it imate enjoyment of their
land J

13. Concludes, on the basis of the report of the Special Rapporteur,
that it is necessary to keep under consideration the situation of human rights
in ChileJ

14. Calls again upon the Chilean authorities to co-operate with the
Special Rapporteur and to submit their comments on his report to the
Commission on Human Rights at its forty-first sessionJ

15. Invites the Commission on Human Rights to study in depth the
of the Special Rapport~ur at its forty-first session and to take the most
appropriate steps for the effective restoration of human rights and
