 III. Recommendation of the Second Committee 
 

 

8. The Second Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of 

the following draft resolution:  

 

 

  Eradicating rural poverty to implement the 2030 Agenda for 

Sustainable Development  
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Recalling its resolution 73/244 of 20 December 2018, entitled “Eradicating rural 

poverty to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”,  

 Reaffirming its resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming 

our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, in which it adopted a 

comprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative 

Sustainable Development Goals and targets, its commitment to working tirelessly for 

the full implementation of the Agenda by 2030, its recognition that eradicating 

poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest 

global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, its 

commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions – 

economic, social and environmental – in a balanced and integrated manner, and to 

building upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seeking 

to address their unfinished business,  

 Reaffirming also its resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015, on the Addis Ababa 

Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, 

which is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, supports 

and complements it, helps to contextualize its means of implementation targets with 

concrete policies and actions, and reaffirms the strong political commitment to 

address the challenge of financing and creating an enabling environment at all levels 

for sustainable development in the spirit of global partnership and solidarity,  

 Reaffirming further the Paris Agreement 1  and its early entry into force, 

encouraging all its parties to fully implement the Agreement, and parties to the United 

Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 2  that have not yet done so to 

deposit their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, where 

appropriate, as soon as possible,

Poverty (2018–2027) should be “Accelerating global actions for a world without 

poverty”, and all other resolutions related to the eradication of poverty, 

 Reaffirming that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including 

extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge facing the world today and is an 

indispensable requirement for sustainable development, particularly in Africa, in the 

least developed countries, in landlocked developing countries, in small island 

developing States and in some middle-income countries, noting with concern that, out 

of 734 million people living in extreme poverty, 38 million fewer will escape extreme 

poverty by 2030, because of the slowdown in the global economy, and underlining 

the importance of accelerating sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth 

and sustainable development, including full, productive employment and decent work 

for all, with a view to reducing inequalities within and among countries,  

 Commending the efforts and remarkable progress achieved by developing 

countries in eradicating rural poverty, while noting with concern that key gaps still 

remain, such as: a lack of adequate data; inadequate investment in agricultural and 

rural development; lower and inadequate human capital formation relevant for rural 

livelihoods; scarce non-farm income-generating opportunities; a lack of productive 

capacity and agricultural transformation; persistent gender inequality; a lack of social 

protection; insufficient basic infrastructure and services; a lack of or poor adaptive 

capacity and resilience to cope with the adverse effects of climate change and 

disasters; and a lack of effective rural institutions and of suff icient resources,  

 Recognizing the leading role of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 

United Nations, together with other United Nations entities, including the 

International Fund for Agricultural Development, the International Labour 

Organization and the United Nations Development Programme, in the global efforts 

to reduce rural poverty, while addressing other interlinked challenges such as 

eliminating hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition and increasing the resilience of 

livelihoods to threats and crises,  

 Noting with appreciation the aspirations, embedded in Agenda 2063 of the 

African Union, to lift huge sections of the population out of poverty, improve incomes 

and catalyse economic and social transformation, and recognizing the importance  of 

the international community helping African countries to achieve such goals, 

especially in the rural areas of the African continent,  

 Noting that, while considerable progress has been made over the past decade 

across all areas of development, the pace of progress observed in recent years is 

insufficient and uneven to fully meet the Sustainable Development Goals and targets 

by 2030, especially in the area of rural poverty eradication,  

 Recognizing that poverty is a serious impediment to the achievement of gender 

equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, including those living in rural 

areas, and that the feminization of poverty persists, emphasizing that the eradication of 

poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is an indispensable 

requirement for sustainable development, acknowledging the mutually reinforcing 

links between the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women 

and girls and the eradication of poverty, and stressing the importance of support for 

countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions,  

 Emphasizing that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

Development depends crucially on the transformation of rural areas, where most of 

the poor and hungry live, and that in order to eradicate rural poverty, investment 

should be channelled towards sectors that have a bigger impact, such as education 

and health, agriculture and infrastructure, while noting an annual financing gap for 

reaching universal pre-primary, primary and secondary education of good quality in 



 
A/74/384/Add.4 

 

5/8 19-21177 

 

low-income and lower middle-income countries of $39 billion over the period  

2015–2030, and that at least $80 billion in annual investment will be needed to meet 

the demand for food that is projected to increase by 70 per cent by 2050, and that the 

investments that are needed for climate change mitigation and adaptation also remain 

underfunded,  

 Welcoming the proclamation of 2019–2028 as the United Nations Decade of 

Family Farming, to raise the profile of the role of family farming4 in contributing to 

the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and reaffirming 

the importance of the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016–2025) in 

the promotion of activities towards the eradication of rural poverty,  

 Recognizing the interlinkages and integrated nature of the Sustainable 

Development Goals, and reiterating that the eradication of rural poverty and hunger 

is crucial for the achievement of internationally agreed development goals, including 

those contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and that rural 

development should be pursued through an integrated approach which encompasses 

economic, social and environmental dimensions, takes into account a gender 

perspective and consists of mutually reinforcing policies and programmes, and which 

should be balanced, targeted, situation specific and locally owned, include local 

synergies and initiatives and be responsive to the needs of rural populations,  

 Recalling that nearly 80 per cent of the extreme poor live in rural areas and work 

in agriculture, that the extreme poverty rate in rural areas is three times higher than 

in urban areas, and that devoting resources to the development of rural areas and 

sustainable agriculture and supporting smallholder farmers, especially women 

farmers, is key to ending poverty in all its forms and dimensions, by, inter alia, 

improving the welfare of farmers,  

 Taking into consideration the increasing number of young people who decide to 

leave rural areas for more urbanized ones and the challenges this trend poses to the 

livelihood of rural families, 

 Expressing its concern that the extreme poor have limited access to productive 

resources, basic health, education and social protection services, basic infrastructure 

such as roads, water and electricity, and off-farm employment opportunities, and are 

susceptible to the impacts of natural disasters, especially weather-related hazards, 

including the El Niño phenomenon, and the adverse effects of climate change, and 

that rural women and girls fare far worse on most development indicators,  

 Emphasizing the importance of enhancing global support for national work on 

rural development policies and strategies, including on commodity production as well 

as increased public and private investments to upgrade productive capacity, and that 

tackling rural poverty requires integrated, cross-sectoral, multi-stakeholder and 

context-specific interventions, with a strong emphasis on sustainable food and  

agricultural systems for food security, nutrition, economic growth, revitalization and 

development in rural areas, 

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General5 and the recommendations 

contained therein;  

 2. Reaffirms that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, 

including extreme poverty, for all people everywhere, is the greatest global challenge 

and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, as well as an 

overarching objective of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,6 of which

the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing 

for Development7 is an integral part, supporting and complementing it;  

 3. Expresses its deep concern that the progress in reducing poverty remains 

uneven, with 1.46 billion people still living in multidimensional poverty, and that this 

number continues to be significant and unacceptably high, whereas the levels of 

inequality in income, wealth and opportunities remain high or are increasing in a 

number of countries, and the non-income dimensions of poverty and deprivation, such 

as access to quality education or basic health services, and relative poverty remain 

major concerns, and stresses the importance of national and global efforts to create 

conditions for sustainable development, inclusive and sustained economic growth, 

shared prosperity and decent work for all in society, taking into account different 

levels of national development capacities;  

 4. Recognizes the importance of promoting socioeconomic development in 

rural areas as an effective strategy and important means at the global level for the 

eradication of poverty, including extreme poverty, and therefore underlines the 

importance of shaping a rural poverty eradication pattern with the concerted effor ts 

of the whole of society to promote socioeconomic development in rural areas;  

 5. Emphasizes that economic growth continues to leave rural dwellers 

behind, that in 2015, 79 per cent of the people living in extreme poverty lived in rural 

areas and 41 per cent of the population in sub-Saharan Africa lived on less than 

$1.90 per day, and recommends countries to promote dedicated and coordinated 

social, economic, agricultural and rural development in their national policies, 

including by adopting rural-focused poverty eradication strategies in alignment with 

the 2030 Agenda, social policies aimed at improving human capital in rural areas and 

ensuring access to adequate social protection coverage, agricultural policies aimed at 

boosting agricultural productivity, and rural development policies aimed at improving 

access to rural infrastructure and basic services of high quality and at boosting 

non-farm employment opportunities; 

 6. Recognizes the critical role and contribution of rural women, including 

smallholders and women farmers, and indigenous women and women in local 

communities, and their traditional knowledge in enhancing agricultural and rural 

development, improving food security and eradicating rural poverty; 

 7. Stresses the importance of taking targeted measures to eradicate poverty 

in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, by formulating rural 

development strategies with clear poverty eradication goals, strengthen ing national 

statistical capacity and monitoring systems and implementing nationally appropriate 

social protection systems and measures for all;  

 8. Recognizes the importance of employment for pro-poor growth in rural 

areas, and encourages the United Nations system and development partners to assist 

countries, upon their request, in mainstreaming employment into investment policy 

and poverty reduction strategies, including those focused on rural area development, 

and fostering rapid agricultural productivity growth, especially in developing 

countries, by increasing investment in agricultural and related rural off -farm activities; 

 9. Also recognizes the need to design, implement and pursue gender-

responsive economic and social policies aimed at, inter alia,  eradicating poverty, 

including in rural areas, and combating the feminization of poverty, ensuring the full 

and equal participation of rural women in the development, implementation and 

follow-up of development policies and programmes and poverty eradicat ion 

strategies, supporting increased rural employment and decent work, and promoting

the participation of women at all levels and sectors of the rural economy and in 

diverse on-farm and off-farm economic activities, including sustainable agricultural 

and fisheries production; 

 10. Encourages Member States, international organizations, the private sector 

and other partners to develop programmes to foster the creation of decent work in 

rural areas and increase the investment in agricultural and related off -farm activities, 

especially for young people; 

 11. Emphasizes that, globally, 2 billion people, primarily in rural areas in 

developing countries, do not have access to formal financial services, and encourages 

further efforts of the international community to offer affordable ways to access 

finance for the financially excluded in rural areas;  

 12. Also emphasizes the need to increase investment, including through 

enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, especially in roads, water, 

sanitation and electricity; 

 13. Expresses its commitment to raising public awareness to promote the 

eradication of poverty and extreme poverty in all countries, to mobilizing the 

enthusiasm and creativity of all stakeholders, especially the rural residents living  in 

extreme poverty, to fight against poverty, to promoting their active participation in 

the design and implementation of programmes and policies which affect them, and to 

providing quality education for the rural poor, with the aim of achieving the 2030 

Agenda for Sustainable Development;  

 14. Reiterates the need for enhanced and expanded access by developing 

countries to appropriate technologies that are pro-poor and raise productivity, and 

underlines the need for measures to increase investment in agriculture, including 

modern technologies, as well as in natural resources management and capacity -

building of developing countries; 

 15. Stresses that the achievement of sustainable development and the 

eradication of poverty also hinge on the ability and readiness of countries to 

effectively mobilize domestic resources, attract foreign direct investment, fulfil 

official development assistance commitments and use official development assistance 

effectively, and facilitate the transfer of technology to developing countries, on 

mutually agreed terms, and further stresses that the resolution of unsustainable debt 

situations is critical for heavily indebted poor countries, while remittances have 

become a significant source of income and finance for receiving economies and their 

contribution to the achievement of sustainable development;  

 16. Recognizes the importance of addressing the diverse needs of and challenges 

faced by countries in special situations, in particular African countries, the least 

developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing 

States, as well as the specific challenges facing many middle-income countries, and 

therefore requests the United Nations development system, the international financial 

institutions, regional organizations and other stakeholders to ensure that these diverse 

and specific development needs are appropriately considered and addressed, in a 

tailored fashion, in their relevant strategies and policies, with a view to promoting a 

coherent and comprehensive approach towards individual countries;  

 17. Realizes that bridging the digital divide will require strong commitment by 

all relevant stakeholders at the national and international levels, reiterates the 

importance of investing in infrastructure for greater access to affordable technological
