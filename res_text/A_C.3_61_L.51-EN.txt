Court, including on the right of peoples to self-determination, which is a right erga

 Recalling the conclusion of the Court, in its advisory opinion of 9 July 2004, 
that the construction of the wall by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, along with measures previously 
taken, severely impedes the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination,9

 Affirming the right of all States in the region to live in peace within secure and

including the right to their independent State of Palestine;  

 2. Urges all States and the specialized agencies and organizations of the 
United Nations system to continue to support and assist the Palestinian people in the 
early realization of their right to self-determination.
