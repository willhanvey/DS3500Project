Aware of the responsibility of the international community to promote human
rights and ensure respect for international law,

Reaffirming the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory
by force,

Reaffirming also the applicability of the Geneva Convention relative to the
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949,5 to the Occupied
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied
by Israel since 1967,

Reaffirming further the obligation of the States parties to the Fourth Geneva
Convention5 under articles 146, 147 and 148 with regard to penal sanctions, grave
breaches and responsibilities of the High Contracting Parties,

Stressing the need for full compliance with the Israeli-Palestinian agreements
reached within the context of the Middle East peace process and the implementation
of the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict,6

Concerned about the continuing systematic violation of the human rights of the
Palestinian people by Israel, the occupying Power, including the use of collective
punishment, the reoccupation and closure of areas, the confiscation of land, the
establishment and expansion of settlements, the construction of a wall inside the
Occupied Palestinian Territory in departure from the Armistice Line of 1949, the
destruction of property and all other actions by it designed to change the legal
status, geographical nature and demographic composition of the Occupied
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem,

Gravely concerned by the tragic events that have occurred since 28 September
2000 and that have led to thousands of deaths and injuries among Palestinian
civilians,

Gravely concerned also by the use of suicide bombing attacks against Israeli
civilians resulting in extensive loss of life and injury,

Expressing deep concern about the extensive destruction caused by the Israeli
occupying forces, including the destruction of homes and properties, of religious,
cultural and historical sites, of vital infrastructure and institutions of the Palestinian
Authority, and of agricultural land throughout Palestinian cities, towns, villages and
refugee camps,

Also expressing deep concern about the Israeli policy of closure and the severe
restrictions, including curfews, imposed on the movement of persons and goods,
including medical and humanitarian personnel and goods, throughout the Occupied
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the consequent impact on the
socio-economic situation of the Palestinian people, which has resulted in a dire
humanitarian crisis,

Expressing concern that thousands of Palestinians continue to be held in Israeli
prisons or detention centres, and also expressing concern about the ill-treatment and
harassment of any Palestinian prisoners and all reports of torture,

Convinced of the need for an international presence to monitor the situation, to
contribute to ending the violence and protecting the Palestinian civilians and to help
the parties to implement agreements reached, and, in this regard, recalls the positive
contribution of the Temporary International Presence in Hebron,

Stressing the necessity for the full implementation of all relevant Security
Council resolutions,

1. Determines that all measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying
Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, in violation
of the relevant provisions of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of
Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949,5 and contrary to the relevant
resolutions of the Security Council, are illegal and have no validity;

2. Demands that Israel, the occupying Power, comply fully with the
provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 19495 and cease immediately all
measures and actions taken in violation of the Convention, including the
extrajudicial executions;

3. Condemns all acts of violence, including all acts of terror, provocation,
incitement and destruction, especially the excessive use of force by Israeli forces
against Palestinian civilians, resulting in extensive loss of life, vast numbers of
injuries and massive destruction;

4. Also condemns the events that have occurred in the Jenin refugee camp in
April 2002, including the loss of life, injury, destruction and displacement inflicted
on many of its civilian inhabitants;

5. Demands that Israel, the occupying Power, cease all practices and actions
that violate the human rights of the Palestinian people;

6. Stresses the need to preserve the territorial integrity of all the Occupied
Palestinian Territory and to guarantee the freedom of movement of persons and
goods within the Palestinian territory, including the removal of restrictions on
movement into and from East Jerusalem, and the freedom of movement to and from
the outside world;

7. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its
fifty-ninth session on the implementation of the present resolution.
