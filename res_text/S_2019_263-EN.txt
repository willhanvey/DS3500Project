and promotion and protection of human rights;  

 18. Calls upon the Government of the DRC to take further steps in particular 

to uphold its national commitments to Security Sector Reform (SSR), and to readjust

comprehensive approach to protection of civilians, in particular through a civilian-

led, mission-wide approach, including the use of integrated Mobile Monitoring 

Teams;

violence are varied, internal and external, and that there is no purely military solution 

to these problems, underlines the importance of enhanced political and conflict
