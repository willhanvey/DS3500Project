 Stressing the importance of the World Conference on Human Rights, held in 

Vienna in 1993, and that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action4 reaffirmed

fundamental human rights and the individual as the central subject and beneficiary of 

development, 

 Reaffirming the objective of making the right to development a reality for 

everyone, as set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, adopted by the 

General Assembly on 8 September 2000,5 

 Recognizing the importance of the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

Development,6 reaffirming that the Declaration on the Right to Development 

informed the 2030 Agenda, along with other relevant international instruments, and 

underlining the fact that the Sustainable Development Goals can be realized only 

through a credible, effective and universal commitment to the means of 

implementation by all stakeholders, 

 Recognizing also the successful conclusion of the United Nations Conference 

on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III), held in Quito from 

17 to 20 October 2016, that recognizes that the New Urban Agenda7 is grounded in 

the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, international human rights treaties, the 

Millennium Declaration and the 2005 World Summit Outcome8 and is informed by 

other instruments such as the Declaration on the Right to Development, 

 Recalling the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on 

Sustainable Development, entitled “The future we want”,9

rights, including the right to development, 

 Recalling the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly known as the 

World Conference on Indigenous Peoples and its outcome document, 10

of poverty and inequity on indigenous peoples by ensuring their full and effective 

inclusion in development and poverty eradication programmes,  

 Reaffirming that democracy, development and respect for human rights and 

fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that 

democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own 

political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in all 

aspects of their lives, and in that context noting that the promotion and protection of 

human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels should 

be universal and conducted without conditions attached and that the international 

community should support the strengthening and promotion of democracy, 

development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the entire 

world,

severe disruption to societies and economies, as well as to global travel and 

commerce, and the devastating impact on the livelihood of people,  

 Recognizing that the poorest and most vulnerable are the hardest hit by the 

pandemic and that the impact of the crisis will reverse hard-won development gains 

and hamper progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, as well 

as progress with regard to the right to development,  

 Recognizing also that, while development facilitates the enjoyment of all human 

rights, the lack of development may not be invoked to justify the abridgement of 

internationally recognized human rights, 

 Recognizing further that Member States should cooperate with one another in 

ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development, that the international 

community should promote effective international cooperation, in particular to 

revitalize a global partnership for development, for the realization of the right to 

development and the elimination of obstacles to development and that last ing 

progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective 

development policies at the national level, as well as equitable economic relations 

and a favourable economic environment at the international level,  

 Recognizing that poverty is an affront to human dignity, 

 Recognizing also that extreme poverty and hunger are among the greatest global 

threats and require the collective commitment of the international community for their 

eradication, pursuant to Millennium Development Goal 1 and Sustainable Development 

Goals 1 and 2, and therefore calling upon the international community, including the 

Human Rights Council, to contribute towards achieving that goal,  

 Recognizing further that historical injustices, inter alia, have contributed to the 

poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion, economic disparity, 

instability and insecurity that affect many people in different parts of the world, in 

particular in developing countries, 

 Recognizing that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including 

extreme poverty, is one of the critical elements in the promotion and realization of 

the right to development and is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable 

requirement for sustainable development, which requires a multifaceted and 

integrated approach, and committed to achieving sustainable development in its three 

dimensions – economic, social and environmental – in a balanced and integrated 

manner, 

 Emphasizing that all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the 

right to development, are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated,  

 Emphasizing also that the right to development is vital for the full realization of 

the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and should be central to its 

implementation, 

 Encouraging relevant bodies of the United Nations system, within their 

respective mandates, including the specialized agencies, funds and programmes of 

the United Nations system, relevant international organizations, including the World 

Trade Organization, and relevant stakeholders, including civil society organizations, 

to give due consideration to the right to development in the implementation of the 

2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to cooperate with the United Nations 

High Commissioner for Human Rights in the fulfilment of her mandate with regard 

to the implementation of the right to development, 



 
A/C.3/75/L.29 

 

5/11 20-14344

United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights concerning the promotion and 

realization of the right to development;15 

 2. Acknowledges the need to strive for greater acceptance, operationalization 

and realization of the right to development at the international level while urging all

institute the measures required for the implementation of the right to development as 

an integral part of all human rights and fundamental freedoms;  

 3. Emphasizes the relevant provisions of General Assembly resolution 

60/251 of 15 March 2006 establishing the Human Rights Council, and in this regard 

calls upon the Council to implement the agreement to continue to act to ensure that 

its agenda promotes and advances sustainable development, including the 2030 

Agenda for Sustainable Development, which seeks to build on the Millennium 

Development Goals and complete what they did not achieve, and also in this regard 

to lead the raising of the right to development, as set out in paragraphs 5 and 10 of 

the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, to the same level as and on a par 

with all other human rights and fundamental freedoms;  

 4. Supports the realization of the mandate of the Working Group on the Right 

to Development,16 and recognizes the need for renewed efforts with a view to 

overcoming the existing political impasse within the Working Group and to fulfil at 

the earliest its mandate as established by the Commission on Human Rights in its 

resolution 1998/72 and the Human Rights Council in its resolution 4/4 of 30 March 

2007;17 

 5. Stresses the importance of the core principles contained in the conclusions 

of the Working Group at its third session18 that are congruent with the purpose of 

international human rights instruments, such as equality, non-discrimination, 

accountability, participation and international cooperation, as critical to mainstreaming 

the right to development at the national and international levels, and underlines the 

importance of the principles of equity and transparency;  

 6. Regrets the further postponement of the twenty-first session of the 

Working Group owing to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and requests the 

Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to make every 

effort to allow the Working Group to hold its twenty-first session in accordance with 

its mandate and methods of work; 

 7. Notes the presentation to the Working Group at its nineteenth session of 

the set of standards for the implementation of the right to development prepared by 

the Chair-Rapporteur,19 which is a useful basis for further deliberations on the 

implementation and realization of the right to development;  

 8. Calls upon Member States to contribute to the efforts of the Working 

Group, including, inter alia, on the elaboration of a draft legally binding instrument 

on the right to development on the basis of the draft prepared by the Chair-Rapporteur, 

as decided by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 42/23 of 27 September 

2019,20 and in this regard notes the report of the Chair-Rapporteur entitled “Draft

convention on the right to development”,21 submitted to the Working Group at its 

twenty-first session; 

 9. Stresses that it is important that the Chair-Rapporteur and the Working 

Group, in the discharge of their mandates, take into account the need: 

 (a) To promote the democratization of the system of international governance 

in order to increase the effective participation of developing countries in international 

decision-making; 

 (b) To also promote effective partnerships such as the New Partnership for 

Africa’s Development and other similar initiatives with the developing countries, 

particularly the least developed countries, for the purpose of the realization of their 

right to development, including the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals; 

 (c) To strive for greater acceptance, operationalization and realization of the 

right to development at the international level, while urging all States to undertake at 

the national level the necessary policy formulation and to institute the measures 

required for the implementation of the right to development as an integral part of all 

human rights and fundamental freedoms, and also while urging all States to expand 

and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation in ensuring development and eliminating 

obstacles to development in the context of promoting effective international 

cooperation for the realization of the right to development, bearing in mind that 

lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires 

effective development policies at the national level and a favourable economic 

environment at the international level; 

 (d) To consider ways and means to continue to ensure the operationalization 

of the right to development as a priority, including in the context of the response to 

and the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, through equitable and fair access for 

all countries, particularly the most vulnerable countries and countries in special 

situations, to vaccines and medicines as global public goods, sharing the benefits of 

scientific progress, financial and technological support and debt relief;  

 (e) To mainstream the right to development into the policies and operational 

activities of the specialized agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations 

system, as well as in the policies and strategies of the international financial and 

multilateral trading systems, bearing in mind in this regard that the core principles of 

the international economic, commercial and financial spheres, such as equity, 

non-discrimination, transparency, accountability, participation and international 

cooperation, including effective partnerships for development, are indispensable in 

achieving the right to development and preventing discriminatory treatment arising 

from political or other non-economic considerations in addressing the issues of 

concern to the developing countries; 

 10. Encourages the Human Rights Council to continue to consider how to 

ensure follow-up to the work of the former Subcommission on the Promotion and 

Protection of Human Rights on the right to development, in accordance with the 

relevant provisions of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the 

Commission on Human Rights and in compliance with decisions to be taken by the 

Council; 

 11. Takes note of the convening of the first session of the Expert Mechanism 

on the Right to Development, established by the Human Rights Council in its 

resolution 42/23, and of the annual report of the Expert Mechanism;22

 12. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Special Rapporteur of the 

Human Rights Council on the right to development,23 in which the Special Rapporteur 

explores the international dimensions of financing for development pol icies and 

practices from the perspective of the right to development;  

 13. Stresses that South-South cooperation is not a substitute for, but rather a 

complement to, North-South cooperation and hence should not result in a reduction 

of North-South cooperation or hamper progress in fulfilling existing official 

development assistance commitments, and encourages Member States and other 

relevant stakeholders to incorporate the right to development into the design, 

financing and implementation of cooperation processes;  

 14. Urges Member States, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 

for Human Rights and other relevant specialized agencies, funds and programmes of 

the United Nations system to provide the Special Rapporteur on the right to 

development with all the assistance and support necessary for the fulfilment of his 

mandate; 

 15. Reaffirms the commitment to implement the goals and targets set out in all 

the outcome documents of the major United Nations conferences and summits and 

their review processes, in particular those relating to the realization of the right to 

development, recognizing that the realization of the right to development is critical 

to achieving the objectives, goals and targets set out in those outcome documents;  

 16. Also reaffirms that the realization of the right to development is essential 

to the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which 

regards all human rights as universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, 

places the human person at the centre of development and recognizes that, while 

development facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights, a lack of development may 

not be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally recognized human rights;  

 17. Further reaffirms that development contributes significantly to the 

enjoyment of all human rights by all, and calls upon all countries to realize people-

centred development of the people, by the people and for the people;  

 18. Calls upon all States to spare no effort in promoting and protecting all 

human rights for all, including the right to development, in particular while 

implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and responding to and 

recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, as it is conducive to the overall enjoyment 

of human rights; 

 19. Stresses that the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection 

of all human rights lies with the State, and reaffirms that States have the primary 

responsibility for their own economic and social development and that the role of 

national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized;  

 20. Reaffirms the primary responsibility of States to create national and 

international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to development, as 

well as their commitment to cooperate with one another to that end;  

 21. Also reaffirms its commitment to international cooperation and 

multilateralism and its strong support for the central role of the United Nations system 

in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic; 

 22. Further reaffirms its resolution 74/274 of 20 April 2020, in which it 

recognized the importance of international cooperation and effective multilateralism 

in helping to ensure that all States have in place effective national protective 

measures, access to and flow of vital medical supplies, therapeutics, medicines and

vaccines, in order to minimize negative effects in all affected States and to avoid 

relapses of the COVID-19 pandemic; 

 23. Expresses concern about the increasing cases of human rights violations 

and abuses by some transnational corporations and other business enterprises, 

underlines the need to ensure that appropriate protection, justice and remedies are 

provided to the victims of human rights violations and abuses resulting from their 

activities, and underscores the fact that these entities must contribute to the means of 

implementation for the realization of the right to development;  

 24. Reaffirms the need for an international environment that is conducive to 

the realization of the right to development; 

 25. Emphasizes the critical importance of identifying and analysing obstacles 

impeding the full realization of the right to development at both the national and 

international levels, including in the context of the response to and the recovery from 

the COVID-19 pandemic; 

 26. Reaffirms that, while globalization offers both opportunities and challenges, 

the process of globalization remains deficient in achieving the objectives of integrating 

all countries into a globalized world, stresses the need for policies and measures at 

the national and global levels to respond to the challenges and opportunities of 

globalization if this process is to be made fully inclusive and equitable, and 

recognizes that globalization has brought disparities between and within countries 

and that issues such as trade and trade liberalization, the transfer of technology, 

infrastructure development and market access should be managed effectively in order 

to mitigate the challenges of poverty and underdevelopment and to make the right to 

development a reality for everyone; 

 27. Recognizes that, despite continuous efforts on the part of the international 

community, the gap between developed and developing countries remains unacceptably 

wide, that most of the developing countries continue to face difficulties in 

participating in the globalization process and that many risk being marginalized and 

effectively excluded from its benefits; 

 28. Expresses its deep concern, in this regard, about the negative impact on 

the realization of the right to development owing to the further aggravation of the 

economic and social situation, in particular of developing countries, as a result of the 

effects of international energy, food and financial crises, as well as the increasing 

challenges posed by global climate change and the loss of biodiversity, which have 

increased vulnerabilities and inequalities and have adversely affected development 

gains, in particular in developing countries;  

 29. Encourages Member States to give particular consideration to the right to 

development in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 

and emphasizes that the 2030 Agenda promotes the respect for all human rights, 

including the right to development; 

 30. Recalls the commitment in the United Nations Millennium Declaration of 

halving the number of people living in poverty by 2015, notes with concern that some 

developing countries have failed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, and 

in this regard invites Member States and the international community to take 

proactive measures aimed at creating a conducive environment to contribute to the
