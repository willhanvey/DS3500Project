draft resolution

The Conference on Disarmament decision (CD/1547) of 11 August
1998 to establish, under item 1 of its agenda entitled “Cessation of
the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament”, an ad hoc
committee to negotiate, on the basis of the report of the Special
Coordinator (CD/1299) and the mandate contained therein, a
non-discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and
effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile
material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolutions 48/75 L of 16 December 1993, 53/77 I of 4 December
1998, 55/33 Y of 20 November 2000, 56/24 J of 29 November 2001, 57/80 of
22 November 2002 and 58/57 of 8 December 2003,

Convinced that a non-discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and
effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear
weapons or other nuclear explosive devices would be a significant contribution to
nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation,

Recalling the 1998 report of the Conference on Disarmament, in which, inter
alia, the Conference recorded that, in proceeding to take a decision on this matter,
that decision was without prejudice to any further decisions on the establishment of
further subsidiary bodies under agenda item 1 and that intensive consultations
would be pursued to seek the views of the members of the Conference on
Disarmament on appropriate methods and approaches for dealing with agenda item
1, taking into consideration all proposals and views in that respect,1
