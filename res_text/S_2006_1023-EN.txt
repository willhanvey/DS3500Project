  Draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Bearing in mind its primary responsibility under the Charter of the United 
Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security, and underlining the 
importance of taking measures aimed at conflict prevention and resolution, 

 Reaffirming its resolutions 1265 (1999), 1296 (2000) and 1674 (2006) on the 
protection of civilians in armed conflict and its resolution 1502 (2003) on protection 
of United Nations personnel, associated personnel and humanitarian personnel in 
conflict zones, as well as other relevant resolutions and presidential statements, 

 Reaffirming its commitment to the Purposes of the Charter of the United 
Nations as set out in Article 1 (1-4) of the Charter, and to the Principles of the 
Charter as set out in Article 2 (1-7) of the Charter, including its commitment to the 
principles of the political independence, sovereign equality and territorial integrity 
of all States, and respect for the sovereignty of all States, 

 Reaffirming that parties to an armed conflict bear the primary responsibility to 
take all feasible steps to ensure the protection of affected civilians, 

 Recalling the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, in particular the Third 
Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 on the treatment of prisoners of war, and the 
Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977, in particular article 79 of the Additional 
Protocol I regarding the protection of journalists engaged in dangerous professional 
missions in areas of armed conflict, 

 Emphasizing that there are existing prohibitions under international 
humanitarian law against attacks intentionally directed against civilians, as such, 
which in situations of armed conflict constitute war crimes, and recalling the need 
for States to end impunity for such criminal acts, 

 Recalling that the States Parties to the Geneva Conventions have an obligation 
to search for persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed 
a grave breach of these Conventions, and an obligation to try them before their own 
courts, regardless of their nationality, or may hand them over for trial to another 
concerned State provided this State has made out a prima facie case against the said 
persons, 

 Drawing the attention of all States to the full range of justice and 
reconciliation mechanisms, including national, international and “mixed” criminal 
courts and tribunals and truth and reconciliation commissions, and noting that such 



S/2006/1023

mechanisms can promote not only individual responsibility for serious crimes, but 
also peace, truth, reconciliation and the rights of the victims, 

 Recognizing the importance of a comprehensive, coherent and action-oriented 
approach, including in early planning, of protection of civilians in situations of 
armed conflict. Stressing, in this regard, the need to adopt a broad strategy of 
conflict prevention, which addresses the root causes of armed conflict in a 
comprehensive manner in order to enhance the protection of civilians on a long-term 
basis, including by promoting sustainable development, poverty eradication, 
national reconciliation, good governance, democracy, the rule of law and respect for 
and protection of human rights, 

 Deeply concerned at the frequency of acts of violence in many parts of the 
world against journalists, media professionals and associated personnel in armed 
conflict, in particular deliberate attacks in violation of international humanitarian 
law, 

 Recognizing that the consideration of the issue of protection of journalists in 
armed conflict by the Security Council is based on the urgency and importance of 
this issue, and recognizing the valuable role that the Secretary-General can play in 
providing more information on this issue, 

 1. Condemns intentional attacks against journalists, media professionals and 
associated personnel, as such, in situations of armed conflict, and calls upon all 
parties to put an end to such practices; 

 2. Recalls in this regard that journalists, media professionals and associated 
personnel engaged in dangerous professional missions in areas of armed conflict 
shall be considered as civilians and shall be respected and protected as such,  
provided that they take no action adversely affecting their status as civilians. This is 
without prejudice to the right of war correspondents  accredited to the armed forces 
to the status of prisoners of war provided for in article 4.A.4 of the Third Geneva 
Convention; 

 3. Recalls also that media equipment and installations constitute civilian 
objects, and in this respect shall not be the object of attack or of reprisals, unless 
they are military objectives; 

 4. Reaffirms its condemnation of all incitements to violence against 
civilians in situations of armed conflict, further reaffirms the need to bring to 
justice, in accordance with applicable international law, individuals who incite such 
violence, and indicates its willingness, when authorizing missions, to consider, 
where appropriate, steps in response to media broadcast inciting genocide, crimes 
against humanity and serious violations of international humanitarian law; 

 5. Recalls its demand that all parties to an armed conflict comply fully with 
the obligations applicable to them under international law related to the protection 
of civilians in armed conflict, including journalists, media professionals and 
associated personnel; 

 6. Urges States and all other parties to an armed conflict to do their utmost 
to prevent violations of international humanitarian law against civilians, including 
journalists, media professionals and associated personnel; 



 S/2006/1023
 

3 06-68154 
 

 7. Emphasizes the responsibility of States to comply with the relevant 
obligations under international law to end impunity and to prosecute those 
responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law; 

 8. Urges all parties involved in situations of armed conflict to respect the 
professional independence and rights of journalists, media professionals and 
associated personnel as civilians; 

 9. Recalls that the deliberate targeting of civilians and other protected 
persons, and the commission of systematic, flagrant and widespread violations of 
international humanitarian  and human rights law in situations of armed conflict 
may constitute a threat to international peace and security, and reaffirms in this 
regard its readiness to consider such situations and, where necessary, to adopt 
appropriate steps; 

 10. Invites States which have not yet done so to consider becoming parties to 
the Additional Protocols I and II of 1977 to the Geneva Conventions at the earliest 
possible date; 

 11. Affirms that it will address the issue of protection of journalists in armed 
conflict strictly under the agenda item “protection of civilians in armed conflict”; 

 12. Requests the Secretary-General to include as a sub-item in his next 
reports on the protection of civilians in armed conflict the issue of the safety and 
security of journalists, media professionals and associated personnel.
