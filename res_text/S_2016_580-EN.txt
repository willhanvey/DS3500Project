  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland:  

draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council,  

 Reaffirming all its previous resolutions and presidential statements concerning 

the situation in Sudan and underlining the importance of full compliance with these,  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, unity, independence and 

territorial integrity of Sudan and its determination to work with the Government of 

Sudan, in full respect of its sovereignty, to assist in tackling the various challenges 

in Sudan,  

 Recalling the importance of the principles of the peaceful settlement of 

international disputes, good neighbourliness, non-interference and cooperation in 

the relations among States in the region,  

 Reaffirming the basic principles of peacekeeping, including consent of the 

parties, impartiality and non-use of force, except in self-defence and defence of the 

mandate, and recognizing that the mandate of each peacekeeping mission is specific 

to the country concerned,  

 Recalling all its relevant resolutions on women, peace and security, on 

children and armed conflicts, on the protection of humanitarian and United Nations 

personnel, and on the protection of civilians in armed conflicts,  

 Expressing deep concern at the ongoing insecurity in Darfur as characterised 

by attacks by rebel groups and Government forces in Jebel Marra, inter -tribal 

fighting, banditry and criminality, including sexual and gender -based violence 

targeting women and girls, which continues to threaten civilians, in particular 

women and children; and reiterating its demand that all parties to the conflict in 

Darfur immediately end violence, including attacks on civilians, peacekeepers and 

humanitarian personnel,  

 Taking note of the lack of military confrontation between the Government of 

Sudan and armed groups in Darfur over the past year, except for Jebel Marra, 

expressing deep concern at a significant increase in violence in and around the Jebel 

Marra, where fighting between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan Liberation 

Army Abdul Wahid (SLA/AW) continued, including aerial bombardments and 

reported attacks on women and children, as well as inter -communal conflict over 

land, access to resources, migration issues and tribal rivalries, including with the 

involvement of paramilitary units and tribal militias, including in East, West and 



S/2016/580 
 

 

16-11205 2/15 

 

North Darfur where inter-communal conflict led to significant displacement as well 

as the killing and wounding of civilians and the wounding of a peacekeeper,  

 Emphasizing that those responsible for violations of international humanitarian 

law and violations and abuses of human rights must be held accountable and that the 

Government of Sudan bears the primary responsibility to protect civilians within its 

territory and subject to its jurisdiction, including protection from crimes against 

humanity and war crimes, 

 Recalling its resolution 2117 (2013) and expressing concern at the threat to 

peace and security in Darfur arising from the illicit transfer, destabilizing 

accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons,  and the continued threats 

to civilians posed by unexploded ordnance,  

 Expressing deep concern at the significant increase in population 

displacements in 2015 and so far in 2016 and the consequent increase in 

humanitarian assistance and protection needs, with 80,000 displaced across Darfur 

during the first five months of 2016 according to the United Nations and partners, 

some of whom have already returned, and unconfirmed reports due to access 

restrictions that up to an additional 127,000 were also reportedly displaced, in 

addition to 247,000 newly displaced in 2015, increasing the estimated total number 

of long-term internally-displaced persons (IDPs) in Darfur to 2.6 million and a total 

number of people in need of humanitarian assistance of 3.3 million,  

 Recalling the commitments made by the Government of Sudan and other 

signatories to the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD) to ensure the 

unimpeded access of humanitarian assistance to the population in need and the 

protection of humanitarian workers and their operations in areas under their control, 

as well as to guarantee UNAMID unimpeded freedom of movement in all areas and 

at all times in Darfur in the exercise of its mandate, and further recalling the role of 

the Implementation Follow-up Commission (IFC) in assessing the implementation 

of the DDPD, 

 Expressing concern that the continued denial of access and restrictions 

imposed on humanitarian actors have left significant gaps in the delivery of 

humanitarian assistance, calling on the Government of Sudan to ensure 

humanitarian actors can operate in support of addressing basic needs,  

 Expressing concern at access restrictions and obstacles, including bureaucratic 

obstacles, imposed on the United Nation-African Union Mission in Darfur 

(UNAMID) which continue to jeopardise its ability to deliver on its mandate, 

including access restrictions in North and Central Darfur which prevent access to 

populations displaced by the fighting in Jebel Marra, welcoming the recent 

clearance by the Government of Sudan of 233 shipments with food rations for 

UNAMID and 16 shipments with United Nations- and contingent-owned equipment, 

noting that clearance for 298 shipments containing United Nations - and contingent-

owned Equipment remains pending, recognising the Government of Sudan’s 

commitment to cooperate with UNAMID and humanitarian personnel on all 

logistical issues and calling on the Government of Sudan to continuously honour its 

commitment in full,  

 Calling on donors, the regional authorities in Darfur and the Government of 

Sudan to provide the financial resources necessary to reach those in need,  



 
S/2016/580 

 

3/15 16-11205 

 

 Reiterating that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Darfur, and 

that an inclusive political settlement is essential to re -establishing peace, and 

underscoring the importance of fully addressing the root causes of the conflict in 

the search for a sustainable peace, which should rapidly deliver real benefits for the 

Darfuri people, in this regard reiterating its support for the DDPD as a viable 

framework for the peace process in Darfur, and for its accelerated implementation, 

as well as the AU High-Level Implementation Panel (AU-HIP) mediated peace 

talks,  

 Acknowledging the Sudan National Dialogue convened in Khartoum in 

October 2015 and the efforts of the Government of Sudan to promote the National 

Dialogue, and further acknowledging that this National Dialogue was not 

sufficiently inclusive as it did not include all relevant parties,  

 Recalling the statements made by the Secretary-General and the Chairperson 

of the African Union Commission, which welcome the signing by the Government 

of Sudan of the Roadmap Agreement proposed by the AU -HIP, urge the 

non-signatory groups to sign it urgently and call on all signatories to fully abide by 

the Roadmap Agreement, 

 Welcoming the additional commitments by the Government of Sudan regarding 

the inclusivity of the National Dialogue,  

 Deploring the fact that some armed groups are impeding the peace process and 

have continued to resort to violence, reiterating its demand for the release of 

members of the former movement of Mohamed Bashar, taken captive in May 2013 

by Justice and Equality Movement (JEM)-Gibril forces, and condemning any 

actions by any armed group aimed at forced overthrow of the Government of Sudan,  

 Noting that UNAMID’s ability to facilitate progress in implementation of the 

DDPD is hampered by delays and the absence of an inclusive political settlement 

between the Government and non-signatory movements, urging the signatory parties 

to take the necessary remaining steps to implement the DDPD fully, expressing 

concern that the humanitarian and security situation, as well as the lack of capacity 

of the regional authorities in Darfur, hinder the transition from relief to stabilization 

and development activities, urging the Government of Sudan, with the support of 

interested donors, to ensure that the outstanding work of the Darfur Regional 

Authority and the Commissions are properly resourced to continue implementation, 

urging donors and the Government of Sudan to honour their pledges and fulfil their 

obligations in a timely manner, including those commitments made at the 

conference in Doha in April 2013, and affirming that development can support a 

lasting peace in Darfur, 

 Noting that local dispute resolution mechanisms play an important role in 

preventing and resolving inter-communal conflict, including conflict over natural 

resources, urging an intensification of effective efforts to prevent local disputes 

leading to violence, with its corresponding impact on the local civilian populations, 

acknowledging the efforts of Sudanese authorities and local mediators to intervene 

through the deployment of security forces and establishment of buffer zones 

between warring communities, and to mediate in inter-communal fighting, 

welcoming the encouraging conclusion of several inter-communal peace 

agreements, with support from UNAMID and the UN Country Team (UNCT), and

the Government of Sudan, to address the root causes of the conflict in Darfur and to 

promote a sustainable peace, including the convening of JEM and the Sudan 

Liberation Army Minni Minnawi (SLA/MM) by the Joint Special Representative/  

Joint Chief Mediator (JSR/JCM) in coordination with the Government of Qatar in 

May 2016 which focused on exploring the possibility for the two move ments to join 

the peace process, and commending the efforts of the JSR/JCM to secure peace, 

stability and security in Darfur, including through support to international, regional 

and national efforts to revitalise the peace process and increase its inclusiveness, 

 Acknowledging efforts by local governments to restore law and order through 

the deployment of additional police, corrections and judicial human and material 

resources across Darfur, including legal advisers, prosecutors, legal aid assistants 

and family protection units and noting that these efforts should be consolidated and 

expanded to enhance the protective environment for the civilian population, 

particularly with respect to violation and abuses of women’s rights and sexual and 

gender-based violence,  

 Underlining, without prejudice to the Security Council’s primary 

responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, the

human rights law and international humanitarian law, stressing the importance that 

the Council attaches to ending impunity including through ensuring accountability 

and bringing to justice the perpetrators of crimes committed by all parties in Darfur,
