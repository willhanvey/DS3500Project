General to this end,  

 Recalling that its resolution 2086 (2013) reiterates the importance, when 

establishing and renewing the mandates of United Nations Missions, to include 

provisions on the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women in 

post-conflict situations and on children and armed conflict, and emphasizing that 

persistent barriers to full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) will only be 

dismantled through dedicated commitment to women ’s empowerment, participation, 

and human rights, and through concerted leadership, consistent information and 

action, and support, to build women’s engagement in all levels of decision-making,  

 Noting with concern the minimum attention the parties have given to the 

management of the Abyei Area as well as the stalled efforts by the Government of 

Sudan and the Government of South Sudan to demilitarize the Safe Demilitarized 

Border Zone (SDBZ), including the “14 Mile Area”, and to fully implement the 

Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism (JBVMM), in accordance with 

Security Council resolution 2046 and the AUPSC Roadmap of 24 April 2012, 

including as a result of South Sudan’s continued disagreement with the location of

clearances, and the tense security situation in the vicinity of Kadugli,  

 Underlining the importance of fully establishing and maintaining effective 

JBVMM monitoring of the SDBZ, including the “14 Mile Area”,

final agreement on the final status of Abyei Area, and stressing that the parties must 

immediately implement pending aspects of the 20 June 2011 Agreement, in 

particular to resolve the dispute over the Abyei Area Council and immediately 

establish the Abyei Area Administration and Abyei Police Service,  



 
S/2015/134 

 

3/7 15-02939

choose the path of dialogue instead of resorting to violence or provocations,  

 Commending the continued assistance provided to the parties by the AUHIP, 

the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the Federal Democratic Republic 

of Ethiopia, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Sudan and South Sudan, 

and the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA),  

 Further commending the efforts of UNISFA in effectively carrying out its 

mandate, including by its ongoing facilitation of peaceful migration throughout the 

Abyei Area, conflict prevention, mediation and deterrence, expressing its deep 

appreciation for the work of the troop-contributing countries, strongly condemning 

the attacks on UN personnel, calling for investigations of these attacks in a swift 

and thorough manner and to hold those responsible to account,

acknowledging UNISFA’s contribution to enhanced peace and stability since its 

deployment, and expressing its determination to prevent the recurrence of v iolence 

against or displacements of civilians and to avert intercommunal conflict,  

 Reiterating its deep concern regarding the public administration and rule of 

law vacuum in the Abyei Area, due to continued delays in the establishment of the 

Abyei Area Administration, Council and Police, including a special unit to deal with 

particular issues related to nomadic migration, which are essential to maintain law 

and order and prevent intercommunal conflict in Abyei,  

 Noting with concern the continued delay in establishing the temporary 

institutions and resolving the final status of Abyei and that the continued threat of 

intercommunal violence contributes to heightened tensions in the Abyei Area, 

including those ongoing tensions that prevent UNISFA’s and other agencies’ 

Sudanese staff from returning to Abyei,  

 Urging all parties to refrain from any unilateral action that could aggravate 

intercommunal relations within Abyei Area, expressing concern over the continued 

implications of what the AUPSC described in their 6 November 2013 press 

statement as “the decision by the Ngok Dinka to conduct a unilateral referendum” 

and also in this context, taking note that according to the 2 February 2015 Secretary-

General’s report (S/2015/77) the Government of Sudan is proceeding with the 

preparations for the organization of its national elections in Abyei,  

 Bearing in mind the current humanitarian situation in which humanitarian 

actors continue to provide assistance to approximately 81,000 people in the Abyei 

Area and the importance of coherence of United Nations assistance in the region, 

and further stressing the urgency of facilitating the delivery of humanitarian 

assistance to all affected populations,

security in the Abyei Area in accordance with its mandate,  

 Recalling its resolution 2117 (2013), and expressing grave concern at the

persons to their homes and safe migration, 

 Taking note of the 2 February 2015 Secretary-General’s report (S/2015/77), 

including its assessment that the political and security situation on the ground is 

increasingly tense, and requires dialogue and cooperation to prevent it becoming 

more contentious, divisive, and destabilizing in the coming months, and the
