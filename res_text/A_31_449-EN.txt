(e) Note by the Secretary-General subnitting a tlraft text of the proposed'
amendments to the Staff Regulations of the United Nations which would be
consequential to the adoption by the General As sembly of the Conm:ission's
recomrnendations ( t/ c. 5 / lt / t+8) .

l+. In accordance with article 1? of its statute (General As senbly resolution
3357 (xxlx) , annex) ' the 

International Civil Service Connission subnitted its

"."ond """nuf ""po , 
1/ covering its vork in f976' to the General Assembly and for

transnission to the governing organs of the other organizations in the United
Nations system participating in its work, through their executive head's ' 

and to
staff representatives.

5. In the firsi, parL of its report, the Coulnission sunnarized its vork during
i9T6 ana describeJits future p].an of vork, in particular the way in which it
proposed to assume its responsibilities under articles 11 and 12 of its statute
with respect to the salaries of the General Service category' The Comission
devoted the second and main part of its repoTt to the provisions of paragraph 3 of
ceneraf Assembly resolution 3357 (xxrx), in which the As sembly requested the
Conmission to review, as a matter of priority, the United' Nations salary system in
accord.ance with its earlier decision 1n paragraph ! of resolution 30)+2 (XXVII ) and
to subnit a progress report to the Assembly at its thirtieth session' The
conclusions and reconmendations of the Conmission on its reviev of the United
Nations salary system and their budgetary implications vere sr:runari zed in
paragraphs 48-86 of its report.

6. The Chairman of the Internationaf Civil Service Connnission introduced the
Cormissionts report in an ora"1 statement before the Fifth Comrittee at its
27th neeting. With respect to the Comnissionts mandate under article 12 of its
statute regaTding the salaTies of the General Service category and other locaLly
recruited categories ' the 

chs.irman erplained that the Cornmission, nindful of the
requests of two of the specialized agencies, had assumed' earlier than it ha'l
iniended., its responsibifities in this respect and, as a first step, had included
in the agend.a of its next session, to be heJ.d in I'eb?uary ]977' the study of the
principles and the methodology to be applied in estabfishing the salaries of the
General Service category. I{e emphasized the importance of this function '
consid.ering that responsibility in this area had hitherto belonged to
admini strations , subiect to the arrangements existing in each organization'

.1 , In the course of reviewing the conclusions and recornnendations reached by tbe
Conmission as a result of its revi.ew of the United Nations salary system, the
chairrnan stated-, inter alia, ihat the reviev carried .ut by the cornrnission coveled
the principal aspEETE- o?-Ii-e United Nations sal-ary systen which, in the opinion of
the conmission, should not call for a further general revier,r for five or six years.
fhe Conmission would continue to study other particular aspects of the salary
systen and l'ould bring to the attention of the Assembly any serious problens which
night require its attention.

B. Ttre Chairman went on to state that the Cornroission considered that ' 
vith the

adjustments it was proposing, the s alary system provided an ad'equate -instrument
ror retaining and recruiting staff of a high 1evel cf competence ' Ad'equate

remunexation was an indispensabl-e element in that regard. He expressed the opinion
that it was nevertheless not in the area of salaries that the economies which the
Member States rightly demanaled. in the face of ever-nounting staff costs shoul-d be
sought. The Connission consid.ered that it was rether in the utilization made of
the staff tha.t the organizations should. seek a rnuch-needed rationali zation.

9. Ttre Chairnan noted that fron the start the Conrnission sought and. received the
participation of the administrations and the staff representatives in the course
of its review. In this connexion, he observed that in order for the participation
of staff representa.tives to be effective they must act with a clear sense of unity;
any division among them could not but weaken the active particilation which the
Conmission had. consistently sought to encourage.

10. The Chairman concluded. by reca1ling that the Comission's task wes to regulate
and co-ord.inate cond.itions of service for the whole of the United Nations common
system. It had. approached its review with this concern in ndntl, tatring into account
the needs and interests of all the organizations of the system and accordingly
regardetl the proposals contained in its report as a package d.esigned to be applierl
as a, whole.

II. GENENAL COMMENTS

11, In their generaL remarks, a nunber of delegations praised. the Conmission for
its comprehensive and. thorough report and for the highly professional way in vhich
it had undertaken the task of fulfilling its mandate whife at the same time
striking a balance between the criteria cal-led for under the principles faid ciown
in Articles 100 anal 101 of the United Nations Charter and their fi.nancial,
implications.

12. In paragraph )+6 of its report, the Con:nission stated that it had not
interpreted vhat was expecteat of it at this time to be a fundamental reform of the
salary Byster0 although it lras of the opinion that such reform would perhaps be
d.esirable in the future. Apart from the fact that the tine availab]-e to it for such
a task was Iinitetl, it vould not, in its view, have been appropriate for it to
attenpt such fundamental refom w-ithout a fu1ler technical study anal, above all,
vithout policy guidelines which should be faid dovn by the political organs of the
Unitect Nations systen.

13. Most delegations agreed with the Commissionrs d.ecision not to undertske a
basic reform of ttre sa1ary system at this time, but to concentrate instead on
inproving the current sa1ary system. A.Ithough reservations r*ere expressed in
respect of sone of the Connissionts reconmend ations , it vas agreed that, as a
'who1e, they s ertred to eLiminate some of the sJronalies and. inequities of the
existing systen. It vas hoped, hovever, that the Comission vou1d. continue to
stuqy the need for further nore fundamental reforrns. The viev vas expressed ths.t
the Genera^l Assenxbly should give clear and precise indications to the Conmission
before it embarked on a basic reform and that for that lurDose the Coomission should
indicate to the Assenbly any valicl options.

1l+. Some delegations observed that" in considering the Commission!s reconmendations ,
the serious financjaL difficulties of the Organization should be kept in rnind; in
light of the current vorld economie situation, international organizations, like
national Governments, should moderate expenditures. Although the international
civil service must be able to attract nationa]-s fTom all countries, it should not
offer higher leve1s of remr.:neration than were stTictly necessary for that purpose.

15. Sone delegations endo"sed the view expressed by the Cornnission in paragraph 1+?
of its report that the sa1ary system was only one of the neans by which utmost
economy and efficiency in the carrying out by the secretariats of the wo"k required
of then by menxber States could be achieved.. Of equal importance vas administrative
management. Greater economies could probabty be realized through improved
mana.gement than through action in the area of salaries.

IIT. COMMENTS OI{ THE RECOM}.MNDATIONS OF THE COMMISSION WITH
RESPECT TO PROFESSIONAI AND HTGI{EB CATEGORIES

16. Tn paragraphs LB ana !9 of jts report, the conmission concluded that no change
should be made in the existing division af the staff of the organizations of the
United Nations system into tl^'o categories. ft al-so concluded that no change should

. be.nade in the mrmber of grades in the Professional- and higher categories, but noted'
for further study in that regard the possible extension of the use of a P-6 grade.
Delegations cornrnenting on this recornmend-ation endo"sed the conclusion that no change
should be made in the number of grades but were not convinced of the necessity and
the logic of introducing a P-5 grade. The view was expressed that introduction of
a new grade could be regarded as encouragement for t'grade creep". fn this
connexion it vas pointed out that "grad.e creep" r,/as not a sol-ution to grade
eongestion and that the introd,uction of a P-6 grade night sirnp].y transfer the
congestion f"om grades P-4 and P-5 to grad.es P-5 and P-5.

Th h^-^--^-!'- E^ cnd 5l of its renort- t}e Connission concluded that not r . !u lar @6r ol,1r- Ju qrs /+
acceptable alLernative could be found to the exisLing practiee of establishing the
level of United Natians rernuneration by comparlson with that of the nationat civil
service whose levels are found. to be highest and which otherwise lends itse.lf to
significant comparison (Noblemaire Principle). It also concluded that the federal
civil service of the United States of America should continue to be used for this
purpose. fhe Commission intended to keep the question of which vas the highest-
paid national civil service und.er review and. to pursue studies with a view to
arriving at a method.ology for conparison of "total- compensation".

18. In paragraph 57 of its report, the Commission reconmendec that the General
Assembly should instruct the Corunission to keep under continual review the
relationship between the levels of remuneration af the United States tr'edere"1 Civil
Service and the United. Nations system, having due regard to all relevant factors,
including the differences between the tvo services and recruitment experience.
When the Commission at any tirne considered corrective action to be necessary it
would reconmend such action to the General Assenbly. If urgent action was necessary
in order to prevent an undue videning of the margin of United Nations temunerati.on
over that of the United States, it would take appropriate measures itself within
Lhe operaLion of the past adjustment system.

19. A nurnber of delegations expressed agreement with the Conmissionrs conelusion
w-ith respect to the continued validity of the Noblemaire principle, but strongly
reconmended that the concept be kept under continued review. some delegations
expressed the opinion that in futule the cornmission should. eval-uate the over-al-l
conditions of service of the internationaf civil service and of the civil- service
used for comparison purposes and not just the salaries. fhey endo?sed the vier.r of
the Commission concerning the need for a methodology for comparison of i'tota1
compensation" and for a continual review of the relationship between the United-
Nations system and that of the United States.Federal Civi] Service, One delegation
expressed reservations w-ith regard to the single comparator approach and was of the
opinion that the tttotal compensation; concept arculd be better served if the
Corunission studied the systen of remuneration of a number of national civif
services arrd devised a foxmul-a based. on the most favourable service conditions.

20. 4.fter stuqying the traditional matching points f.r eomparing equivalencies of
grades between the United i'Ta+"i.ons system and the United States Federal Ci.ril
Service, bhe cor,nission reccrn-ended ccrtain chanses in para6iraph 52 of its reFort.
Some detegations believed that the evidence adduced by the Corn-nission in reaching
its eonclusion r,ras insuffi.cient to val:rant such change at thr'.s time and agreeC with
the Cornnission that the rnatching points it had establ,isbed rrere not to be
considered. permarent or irnmutable and should be verified periodi ca11y, preferably
with the assistance of independent experts.

21-. Sone delegations questioned the conclusion of the Comnission in paragraph 5l+
of its report that the comparison between United States civil service remuneration
8.nd that of the United Nations system should be mad.e between the head.quarters of
the two systenrs, that is, between Washington, D.C. and New York, the difference in
the cost of living between the two cities being taken into account in the
compari son. One delegation, although agreeing w-ith the Cormission's conclusion,
suggested. that it would perhaps at thi.s time be nore logical to drar,' a mean
between New York and Geneva or Vienna, for example. Sone delegations coufd not
agree that Washington should be used as a basis for cornparison and. pointed out that
a large number of United States government enployees in New York City performed.
professional- iluties comparabfe to those performed by United. Nations Professionals;
a compari.son made in New York showed a margin of 31-59 per cent between the tvo
s al-ary systens.

22. In this latter connexion, some reservations were expressed regardi.ng the
Cormission's concl-usion in paragraph !6 of its report that the existing leve1 of
United Nations remuneration i.n relation to that of the United States civil- ser-vice
a'as satisfactory. Sone delegations expressed the view that the existing level of
United. Nations remuneration rras too generous and that the rnargin betrnreen the United
Nations and the United States systens was excessive. It was gene?alIy agreed that
measures should be tslen to prevent an undue widening of the rnargin between the
two systems. one delegation suggested. tbat the difference in renuneration between
the ttto systems should be reduced., particularly at those fevels vhere it was nost
markecl, and. that a difference of approxinately 10 per cent at eech level wou-Id be
adequate. Sone alelegations proposed that the Conmission night set maximr:m and
minimrm linits to the margin between the two systems.

23. Delegations generally endorsed the Conmissionrs recorutrendation, in paragraph !!
of its repart, that the differentiation betveen the over-all net remuneration of
staff members without dependants a"nd that of those r^'ith dependants should be
effected through differentiated rates of staff assessnent rather than through the
post-adjustment system which had in some cases resutted in excessive and anomalous
differences in pry.

214. The corffirission, in conjunction with other changes it recon:mended in the sarary
system, recornmended that five cfasses of post adjustment shoul-d. be consolidated
into the base salary in order to restore pensionabre remuneration to i.ts normal
par relationship to gross s ala"y on 1 January l9T?, Some delegations supported the
Conmissionrs reconmendation as a means of restoring the balance between pensionable
remuneration and gross sal"ary, One delegation stated that it vas opposed to the
consolidation of five classes of post e.d.Justment into base salary since it rarould
invol-ve unjustified financial implications, and because it considered such action
to result in a ''concealed "' increase in salary.

25. Pointing out that the post-adjustnent system, the purpose of which was to
rnainLain equaliLy of purchasing power of sa.raries betveen different duty stations,
had also resulted in protecting salaries against increases in cost of living, one
delegatio;r favoured elirnination of the cost-of-living indexation factoa from the
system. ft was opposed to the practice of providing automati c protection against
increases in the cost of living at the base of the systen since it resul,ted in
widening excessively the nargin between United Nations renuneration and that of
the United States civil service, the l-atter being related to comparable salary
1evels in the United States private sector which were in turn influenced by a number
of other eeonomic factcrs, Severaf, delesations aereed with this view and endorsed
the view expressed in paragraph 229 of i.;ie Commission's report that the concept ot
provid.ing fu11 protection fo" international civil servants aAainst increase6 in the
cost of living shoul-d. be reviewed."

26. Cornroenting on the rate of post adjustment, one delegation observed that the
report of the Cornmission lacked information on the propartion of spendable income
on wbich the rate of post adjustment was calculated and asked for assurances that
the real level of spendable incone was taken fu11y into accor:nt in calcul-ating those
rates. An afternative way of applying the post-adjustment system suggested by this
delegation was the estabtishnent of a non-r0ovable base, such as the cost of living
in Washington, D,C.; United Natj.ons staff would then be compensated for cost-of-
living increases in excess of those in Washington. Another delegation proposed that
a careful study should be made of the post-adjustment system and suggested thab
excessive inereases should be avoided lrith respect to higher salaries and that
adiustments ehoufd be made less frequently when the 1eve1 of post adjustment
exeeeded 10 c].asses.

27. The view was also expressed that an upper linit shou]-d be placed on the pension
entitlenents of staff members, for example, at the level of the entitlement of a
staff member cf D-2 grade vith 30 years t service.

28. In its exanination ol expatriation benefits, the Connission recornmended, in
paragraph 73 of its report, a revised sca.Ie of aaount s of repatriation grants for



A/3L/\\9
English
Page 7

staff members of the Professional and higher categories vith effect frorc
I January 1977. Some delegations stated that although they had no objection to the
introduction of the new scale they betieved that a ceiling should be established
for such grants, seen in relation to other entitlements of a staff member upon
separation. The view was afso expressed that the Comrnission should consider
vhether staff members who did not Teturn to their country of origin on retirement
shoufd be entitled to the grant.

29. The Corrnissjon, in paragraphs 75 and,76 of its report, reconnended that the
conditions of eli.gibiJ-ity for education grant s should. be revised. so as to enable
an expatriate staff member to cl-ain in respect of expenses of education of a child
at a r:niversity in the corutry of the staff menber I s d"uty station. It also
reiormended a regressive scale of percentages of costs which would be reimbursable
under the provisions bf the grsnt, It noted that it had not recosnended any change
in the existing age lirnit of el-igibility for the grant, but might re-examine that
question at some future date.

30. Sone delegations supported the Con:nission's recommendation and believed that
the expatriation factor justified extension of the grant to cover university
studies in the country of the d-uty station. One defegation expressed the view that
a more realistic cut-off date for the education grant would be the twenty-fiTst
birthday. Other d.elegations 

" 
however, were of the opinion that the series of

concessions made to the education gra.nt over the years since its institution in
19!6 had resulted in a departure from its original purpose, that is, to facilitate
an educd.tion which would enable the children of expatTiate staff to assirnilate in
their own country when they returned to it. They believed that the origineJ
Justification had been aba.ndoned since the grant was payable for attendance at
schools or universities in any cormtry, thus constituting a discrimination against
non-expatTiate staff members. It was suggested that the Connission reconsider the
justification for this al-lovance in relation to its original purpose" taking into
account the practice of other national systems and that of the best-paid national
civil service.

31. The Connission, in paragraphs JB and 79 of its report, recornmended that the
scale of termination indennities be revised and that an end-of-service grant be
payabfe to a staff nember hol-ding a fixed-terrn appointment vhere appointment is
not renewed. after six years of continuous service.

32. Although the principle of "agreed ternination" vas generally supported, sone
delegations expressed doubts as to the need to increase the maximum amount of the
indennities considering that the fevel cf salary on which they loufd be based would
itself be increased as a result of consolidation. Doubts vere a]-so expressed with
regaril to the Cornmission's recormendation (para. 65) Lha1- the amormts of termination
indennities, together vith those of other payments 'rn separation ' should 

be based
on pensionable remuneration fess staff assessment rather than on base pay.

33. The proposed new end.-of-service grant was opposed by 6ome delegations on
€rounds both of principle and of its financial irnplications. ft rdas pointed out
that the Organization|s responsibility tc the holders of fixed-tem contracts
should be limited to ensuring that the terms of enploJrment agreed upon vere met.



A/3r/\\9
English
Page B

Moreover, ma.ny staff members hording such contracts vere seconded by their nationa:civil services and. resumed their work after serving at the united ttations. other
delegations agreed that some form of compensation should be provided in such casesin light of the increasing use nade by orpganizations in the united Natians systenof fixed-term appointments, and one d.elegation considered that entitlenent *"o thegrant should begin at less thafi six years of service and applied on a p"o rata
basis "

31+' one delegation called attention to the desirability of improving the terns of
pa;'ments due upon the death of a staff member in service and eipressea the vie.wthat the rnaximum should be incrqased. to 12 months in alignnent *ittr ttr. pr.oposed. new
scsJ-es for termination indennity. This same d.elegation stressed the inportance of
the question of d.av-care facilities for children of staff memberg (parai, :_B-et or
the Conmission's report) and urged. that it be pursued. within the context, of
progres sive peraonnel- poli cy.

3r. Some del"egations reiterated their opposition to the present r,language
incentiverr systern (pa,'as. 3L64?r of the iornrnission's replrt) which tiey consid.ered
to be dis crirninatory, and urged_ that it be re-examined as soon as possible.

IV, GH{EXAL SEiVICE CATEGORY

36. Most d.elegations expressed satisfaetion with the commissionrs intention to
assume, aa a matter of priority in f97I , its responsibilities 

'nd.er 
article 12 ofits-statute with respect to the s alary scales of the Generar service categoay. The

need. for a thorough review of the guiding principles and methodology applied in
determining the salaries and allowances of the General Service catego"y,
particularly at Geneva, was emphasized.. some delegations expressed the vie[' that,
pending such a review by the conmission, further increases in saLaries at Geneva
under the existing arrangements shoufd be kept to a minimum or be suspended.
