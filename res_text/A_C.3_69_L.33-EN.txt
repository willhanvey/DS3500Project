freedom of expression and opinion, and urges the Islamic Republic of Iran to 

translate them into concrete action that results in demonstrable improvements as

 (i) To fulfil repeated pledges by the President for greater space for freedom

recommendation by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights;10

and purpose of the treaty, to consider acting upon the concluding observations
