19-20798 2/4 

 

 Condemning the ongoing temporary occupation of part of the territory of 

Ukraine, namely, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol 

(hereinafter referred to as “Crimea”), by the Russian Federation, and reaffirming the 

non-recognition of its annexation, 

 Recalling that the temporary occupation of Crimea and the threat or use of force 

against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine by the Russian 

Federation is in contravention of commitments made under the Memorandum on 

Security Assurances in Connection with Ukraine’s Accession to the Treaty on the 

Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (Budapest Memorandum) of 5 December 

1994,1 in which, inter alia, the obligations to refrain from the threat or use of force 

against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine and the 

commitment to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of 

Ukraine were reaffirmed, 

 Expressing concern over the efforts of the Russian Federation to extend its 

jurisdiction over the nuclear facilities and material in Crimea, 

 Affirming that the seizure of Crimea by force is illegal and a violation of 

international law, and affirming also that those territories must be immediately 

returned, 

 Recalling the prohibition, in accordance with international humanitarian law, 

for the occupying Power to compel protected persons to serve in its armed or auxiliary 

forces, including through pressure or propaganda that is aimed at securing voluntary 

enlistment, and condemning the ongoing recruitment campaign in Crimea and 

criminal prosecutions of Crimean residents for draft evasion,  

 Concerned by efforts to use the education of children in Crimea in order to 

indoctrinate them to join the Russian military forces,  

 Taking note of the order of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea of 

25 May 2019 on provisional measures in the Case concerning the detention of three 

Ukrainian naval vessels (Ukraine v. Russian Federation) and Procedural Order No. 1 

of the Arbitral Tribunal Constituted under Annex VII to the 1982 United Nations 

Convention on the Law of the Sea between Ukraine and the Russian Federation in 

respect of a Dispute concerning the Detention of Ukrainian Naval Vessels and 

Servicemen of 22 November 2019, 

 Noting the fact that security concerns and the build-up of forces in the Black 

Sea and the Sea of Azov regions further destabilize the economy and social services, 

particularly in the coastal regions of Ukraine,  

 Supporting the commitment by Ukraine to adhere to international law in its 

efforts to put an end to the temporary Russian occupation of Crimea,  

 1. Stresses that the presence of Russian troops in Crimea is contrary to the 

national sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine and 

undermines the security and stability of neighbouring countries and the European 

region; 

 2. Expresses its grave concern over the progressive militarization of Crimea 

by the Russian Federation as the occupying Power, and also expresses concern over 

reports of the continuing destabilization of Crimea owing to transfers by the Russian 

Federation of weapon systems, including nuclear-capable aircraft and missiles, 

weapons, ammunition and military personnel to the territory of Ukraine, and urges 

the Russian Federation to stop such activity;

jurisdiction over the nuclear facilities and material in Crimea;

military bases in the Russian Federation, and urges the Russian Federation to stop 

such illegal activity; 

 6. Expresses its concern regarding multiple military exercises of Russian 

armed forces held in Crimea, which undermine regional security and entail 

considerable long-term negative environmental consequences in the region;  

 7. Also expresses its concern over the ongoing actions of the Russian 

Federation in parts of the Black Sea surrounding Crimea, in the Sea of Azov and in 

the Kerch Strait, including their militarization, which pose further threats to Ukraine 

and undermine the stability of the broader region;  

 8. Expresses its utmost concern about the dangerous increase in tensions and 

the unjustified use of force by the Russian Federation against Ukraine, including 

against three vessels of the naval forces of Ukraine, namely, the Berdyansk, the 

Nikopol and the tugboat Yani Kapu, on 25 November 2018 in the Black Sea, which 

involved the serious wounding of some of their crew members and the intent ional 

obstruction of traffic through the Kerch Strait;  

 9. Welcomes the release by the Russian Federation of 24 crew members of 

three vessels of the naval forces of Ukraine, namely, the Berdyansk, the Nikopol and 

the tugboat Yani Kapu; 

 10. Calls upon the Russian Federation to return unconditionally and without 

delay all equipment and weapons seized from the released vessels, the Berdyansk, the 

Nikopol and the tugboat Yani Kapu, to the custody of Ukraine; 

 11. Encourages further negotiations to ensure the release by the Russian 

Federation of all illegally detained Ukrainian citizens and their safe return to Ukraine;  

 12. Calls upon the Russian Federation to refrain from impeding the lawful 

exercise of navigational rights and freedoms, including but not limited to closure of 

sea areas under the pretext of military exercises, in the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov 

and the Kerch Strait in accordance with applicable international law, including 

provisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea; 2  

 13. Condemns the construction and opening by the Russian Federation of the 

Kerch Strait bridge between the Russian Federation and temporarily occupied 

Crimea, which facilitates the further militarization of Crimea and restricts the size of 

ships that can reach the Ukrainian ports on the Azov coast, and also condemns the 

increasing military presence of the Russian Federation in parts of the Black Sea and 

the Sea of Azov, including the Kerch Strait, and the harassment of commercial vessels 

by the Russian Federation and its restriction of international shipping there, which 

further aggravates the economic and social situation in the broader Donetsk region 

already affected by the temporary occupation of Crimea;  

 14. Also condemns visits of Russian officials to the temporarily occupied 

Crimea, including those in connection with conducting military exercises;
