  France and Tunisia: draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace 

and security, 

 Reaffirming the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations,  

 Expressing grave concern about the devastating impact of the COVID-19 

pandemic across the world, especially in countries ravaged by armed conflicts, or in 

post-conflict situations, or affected by humanitarian crises,  

 Recognizing that conditions of violence and instability in conflict situations can 

exacerbate the pandemic, and that inversely the pandemic can exacerbate the adverse 

humanitarian impact of conflict situations,  

 Recognizing that the peacebuilding and development gains made by countries 

in transition and post-conflict countries could be reversed in light of the COVID-19 

pandemic outbreak, 

 Underscoring that combating this pandemic requires greater national, regional 

and international cooperation and solidarity, and a coordinated, inclusive, 

comprehensive and global international response with the United Nations playing a 

key coordinating role, 

 Commending the continued contribution and commitment of national and 

international health and humanitarian relief personnel to respond urgently to the 

COVID-19 pandemic, 

 Recognizing efforts and measures proposed by the Secretary-General 

concerning the response to the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to 

conflict-affected countries, in particular his appeal for an immediate global ceasefire,  

 Having considered the resolution 74/270 “Global solidarity to fight the 

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)” adopted by the UN General Assembly on 

April 2nd 2020, 

 Acknowledging the launch of the Global Humanitarian Response Plan for 

COVID-19 by the United Nations, which puts the people at the center of the response,  

 Considering that the unprecedented extent of the COVID-19 pandemic is likely 

to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security,  

 1. Demands a general and immediate cessation of hostilities in all situations 

on its agenda and supports the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General and his 

Special Representatives and Special Envoys in that respect;

S/2020/607 
 

 

20-08830 2/2 

 

 2. Calls upon all parties to armed conflicts to engage immediately in a 

durable humanitarian pause for at least 90 consecutive days, in order to enable the 

safe, unhindered and sustained delivery of humanitarian assistance, provisions of 

related services by impartial humanitarian actors, in accordance with the 

humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, and 

medical evacuations, in accordance with international law, including international 

humanitarian law and refugee law as applicable;  

 3. Affirms that this general and immediate cessation of hostilities and this 

humanitarian pause do not apply to military operations against the Islamic State in 

Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as Da’esh), Al Qaeda and Al Nusra Front 

(ANF), and all other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities  associated with Al 

Qaeda or ISIL, and other terrorist groups, which have been designated by the Security 

Council;  

 4. Requests the Secretary-General to help ensure that all relevant parts of the 

United Nations system, including UN Country Teams, in accordance with their 

respective mandates, accelerate their response to the COVID-19 pandemic with a 

particular emphasis on countries in need, including those in situations of armed 

conflict or affected by humanitarian crises;  

 5. Requests the Secretary-General to provide updates to the Security Council 

on the UN efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic in countries in situations of 

armed conflict or affected by humanitarian crises, as well as on the impact of 

COVID-19 on the ability of peace-keeping operations and Special Political Missions 

to deliver their mandated priority tasks;  

 6. Requests the Secretary-General to instruct peace-keeping operations to 

provide support, within their mandates and capacities, to host country authorities in 

their efforts to contain the pandemic, in particular to facilitate humanitarian access, 

including to internally displaced persons and refugee camps and allow for medical 

evacuations, and further requests the Secretary-General and Member States to take 

all appropriate steps to protect the safety, security and health of all UN personnel in 

UN peace operations, while maintaining the continuity of operations, and to take 

further steps towards the provision of training for peacekeeping personnel on issues 

related to preventing the spread of COVID-19; 

 7. Acknowledges the critical role that women are playing in COVID-19 

response efforts, as well as the disproportionate negative impact of the pandemic, 

notably the socio-economic impact, on women and girls, children, refugees, internally 

displaced persons, older persons and persons with disabilities, and calls for concrete 

actions to minimize this impact and ensure the full, equal and meaningful 

participation of women and youth in the development and implementation of an 

adequate and sustainable response to the pandemic;  

 8. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
