  China, Croatia, France, Italy, Russian Federation,  
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland  
and United States of America: draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming its resolutions 1540 (2004) of 28 April 2004 and 1673 (2006) of 
27 April 2006, 

 Reaffirming that proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as 
well as their means of delivery, constitutes a threat to international peace and 
security, 

 Reaffirming the Statement of its President adopted at the Council’s meeting at 
the level of Heads of State and Government on 31 January 1992 (S/23500), 
including the need for all Member States to fulfil their obligations in relation to 
arms control and disarmament and to prevent proliferation in all its aspects of all 
weapons of mass destruction, 

 Reaffirming that prevention of proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological 
weapons should not hamper international cooperation in materials, equipment and 
technology for peaceful purposes while goals of peaceful utilization should not be 
used as a cover for proliferation, 

 Affirming its resolve to take appropriate and effective actions against any 
threat to international peace and security caused by the proliferation of nuclear, 
chemical and biological weapons and their means of delivery, in conformity with its 
primary responsibilities, as provided for in the United Nations Charter, 

 Reaffirming its decision that none of the obligations in resolution 1540 (2004) 
shall be interpreted so as to conflict with or alter the rights and obligations of State 
Parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention 
and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention or alter the responsibilities of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency or the Organization for the Prohibition of 
Chemical Weapons, 

 Noting also that international cooperation between States, in accordance with 
international law, is required to counter the illicit trafficking by non-State actors in 
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, their means of delivery, and related 
materials,

Committee and Member States and stressing that direct contact is an effective means 
of such dialogue,

subregional and international levels, as appropriate, in order to strengthen a global 
response to this serious challenge and threat to international security,

their requests, with effective assistance that meets their needs and stressing the 
importance of ensuring that the clearinghouse function for assistance is efficient and 
accessible,

1540 (2004), including on preventing the financing of proliferation-related
