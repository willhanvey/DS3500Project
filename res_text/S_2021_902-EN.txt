  Mexico and United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 

draft resolution 
 

 

 The Security Council, 

 Reaffirming its full commitment to the peace process in the Republic of 

Colombia, 

 Recalling all its resolutions and statements of its President regarding the peace 

process in Colombia, 

 Welcoming the progress made towards peace across Colombia since the adoption 

of the Final Agreement for Ending the Conflict and Building a Stable and Lasting 

Peace (the Final Agreement), noting the upcoming fifth anniversary of its signing, 

and urging the parties, with the support of relevant state institutions and security 

forces, as well as civil society, to work together to build upon this progress and 

address ongoing challenges, in particular the continued violence in conflict -affected 

areas, through comprehensive implementation of the Final Agreement, including rural 

reform, inclusive political participation, its ethnic and gender provisions, and 

countering illicit drugs including through crop substitution programmes,  

 Recalling in particular its resolution 2366 (2017) which established the United 

Nations Verification Mission in Colombia (the Verification Mission) to verify 

implementation by the Government of Colombia and Revolutionary Armed Forces of 

Colombia (FARC-EP) of sections 3.2 and 3.4 of the Final Agreement as called for in 

section 6.3.3 of the Final Agreement, and recalling the positive role played by the 

Verification Mission in that regard,  

 Recalling also its resolution 2574 (2021) which expanded the mandate of the 

Verification Mission to include the additional task of verifying compliance with and 

implementation of the sentences to be issued by the Special Jurisdiction for Peace 

(SJP), and welcoming the preparations being made by the Verification Mission, 

working with the SJP, in this regard,  

 Noting that, under the terms of the Final Agreement, the sentences of the SJP 

will have the overall aim of realising the rights of victims and consolidating peace, 

and will need to have the greatest restorative and reparative function in relation to the 

harm caused,  

 Recognising the contribution the Verification Mission could make to building 

confidence in the Comprehensive System for Truth, Justice, Reparation and 

Non-Repetition established under the Final Agreement, which is integral to the 

success of the peace process and the fulfilment of the rights of the victims of the 

conflict,

 Acknowledging the letter of 20 October 2021 from the President of Colombia 

requesting an extension of the mandate of the Verification Mission on behalf of the 

Government of Colombia and the party of the former FARC-EP,  

 1. Decides to extend the mandate of the Verification Mission until 31 October 

2022; 

 2. Expresses its willingness to work with the Government of Colombia on the 

further extension of the mandate of the Verification Mission on the basis of agreement 

between the parties.
