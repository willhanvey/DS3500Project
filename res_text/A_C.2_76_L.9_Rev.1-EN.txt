 Reaffirming further the Paris Agreement 1  and its early entry into force, 

encouraging all its parties to fully implement the Agreement, and parties to the United 

Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 2  that have not yet done so to 

deposit their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, where 

appropriate, as soon as possible,  

 Reaffirming the New Urban Agenda, adopted at the United Nations Conference 

on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III), held in Quito, Ecuador, 

from 17 to 20 October 2016,3  

 Bearing in mind that the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations in 2020 

and the fifth anniversary of the adoption of the 2030 Agenda presented an opportunity 

to reaffirm collective commitment to multilateralism and to the United Nations, and 

reaffirming the urgent need to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, 

including the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular the eradication of poverty,  

 Recalling its declaration, in its resolution 47/196 of 22 December 1992, of 

17 October as the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty,  

 Recalling also its resolution 72/233 of 20 December 2017, in which it 

considered that the theme of the Third United Nations Decade for the Eradication of 

Poverty (2018–2027) should be “Accelerating global actions for a world without 

poverty”, and all other resolutions related to the eradication of poverty,  

 Reaffirming that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including 

extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge facing the world today and is an 

indispensable requirement for sustainable development, particularly in Africa, in the 

least developed countries, in landlocked developing countries, in small island 

developing States and in some middle-income countries, noting with concern that as 

of 2017 approximately 696 million people still lived in extreme poverty and that the 

coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is estimated to have pushed an additional 

97 million people into extreme poverty in 2020, and underlining the importance of 

accelerating sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth and sustainable 

development, including full, productive employment and decent work for a ll, with a 

view to reducing inequalities within and among countries,  

 Noting with great concern the severe negative impact on human health, safety 

and well-being caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as 

the severe disruption to societies and economies and the devastating impact on lives 

and livelihoods, and that the poorest and most vulnerable are the hardest hit by the 

pandemic, reaffirming the ambition to get back on track to achieve the Sustainable 

Development Goals by designing and implementing sustainable and inclusive 

recovery strategies to accelerate progress towards the full implementation of the 2030 

Agenda for Sustainable Development and to help to reduce the risk of and build 

resilience to future shocks, crises and pandemics, including by strengthening health 

systems and achieving universal health coverage, and recognizing that equitable and 

timely access for all to safe, quality, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccines, 

therapeutics and diagnostics are an essential part of a global response based on unity, 

solidarity, renewed multilateral cooperation and the principle of leaving no one 

behind, 

 Noting that over 46 per cent of the global rural population is poor, compared 

with approximately 16 per cent of the global urban population, and that 4.5 billion 

people depend on food systems for their livelihoods, recognizing that addressing rural

poverty is fundamental for the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 1 of 

the 2030 Agenda, as well as most of the other Goals, wi th 70 per cent of the targets 

requiring action in rural areas, emphasizing that the impacts of the COVID -19 

pandemic on sustainable development have increased the number of people living in 

poverty around the world and disrupted, inter alia, the normal functioning of open 

markets, global supply chain connectivity and the flow of essential goods, hindering 

the fight against poverty and adding urgency to the call to galvanize action and 

delivery for the eradication of poverty, in all its forms and dimensions,  particularly in 

rural areas, where most of the extreme poor live, stressing that global inequities in 

access to COVID-19 vaccines, with the bulk of vaccines disproportionately available 

in high-income countries, in contrast with the low availability of COVID-19 vaccines 

in low-income countries, further put at risk the health of the rural poor, in this regard 

welcoming the Sustainable Development Goals Moment placing an emphasis on 

poverty and inequality, on climate change and a healthy planet and on achiev ing 

gender equality, taking note of the efforts of the President of the General Assembly at 

its seventy-fourth session to launch the Alliance for Poverty Eradication, which is 

timely and meaningful and continues to serve as a platform for the exchange of i deas, 

policies and best practices on poverty eradication, and stressing the importance of 

addressing poverty, including rural poverty issues, in these forums, as the rural poor 

might be less prepared to deal with the effects of and recover from the COVID -19 

crisis and could have less access to adequate sanitation, food and nutrition, health -

care services, education, the Internet, information and communications technology, 

social protection, financial services and public infrastructure,  

 Commending the efforts and remarkable progress achieved by developing 

countries in eradicating rural poverty, while noting with concern that key gaps still 

remain, such as: a lack of adequate data; inadequate investment in agricultural and 

rural development; lower and inadequate human capital formation relevant for rural 

livelihoods; scarce non-farm income-generating opportunities; a lack of productive 

capacity and agricultural transformation; persistent gender inequality; a lack of social 

protection; insufficient basic infrastructure and services; a lack of or poor adaptive 

capacity and resilience to cope with the adverse effects of climate change and 

disasters; and a lack of effective rural institutions and of sufficient resources,  

 Recognizing the leading role of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 

United Nations, together with other United Nations entities, including the 

International Fund for Agricultural Development, the International Labour 

Organization and the United Nations Development Programme, in the global  efforts 

to reduce rural poverty, while addressing other interlinked challenges such as 

eliminating hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition and increasing the resilience of 

livelihoods to threats and crises,  

 Noting with appreciation the aspirations, embedded in Agenda 2063 of the 

African Union, to lift huge sections of the population out of poverty, improve incomes 

and catalyse economic and social transformation, and recognizing the importance of 

the international community’s helping African countries to achieve such goals, 

especially in the rural areas of the African continent,  

 Noting that, while considerable progress has been made over the past decade 

across all areas of development, the pace of progress observed in recent years is 

insufficient and uneven to fully meet the Sustainable Development Goals and targets 

by 2030, especially in the area of rural poverty eradication,  

 Recognizing that poverty is a serious impediment to the achievement of gender 

equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, including those living in rural 

areas, and that the feminization of poverty persists, emphasizing that the eradication 

of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is an 



A/C.2/76/L.9/Rev.1 
 

 

21-16760 4/8 

 

indispensable requirement for sustainable development, acknowledging the mutually 

reinforcing links between the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment 

of all women and girls and the eradication of poverty, and stressing the importance of 

support for countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty in all its forms and 

dimensions,  

 Emphasizing that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda depends crucially on 

the transformation of rural areas, where most of the poor and hungry live, and that, in 

order to eradicate rural poverty, investment should be channelled towards sectors that 

have a bigger impact, such as education and health, agriculture and infrastructure, 

while noting an annual financing gap for reaching universal pre-primary, primary and 

secondary education of good quality in low-income and lower middle-income 

countries of 44 billion United States dollars over the period 2015–2030, and that at 

least 80 billion dollars in annual investment will be needed to meet the demand for 

food that is projected to increase by 70 per cent by 2050, and that the investments that 

are needed for climate change mitigation and adaptation also remain underfunded,  

 Recalling the proclamation of 2019–2028 as the United Nations Decade of 

Family Farming, to raise the profile of the role of family farming 4 in contributing to 

the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, and reaffirming the importance of the United 

Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016–2025) in the promotion of activities 

towards the eradication of rural poverty,  

 Recognizing the interlinkages and integrated nature of the Sustainable 

Development Goals, and reiterating that the eradication of rural poverty and hunger 

is crucial for the achievement of internationally agreed development goals, including 

those contained in the 2030 Agenda, and that rural development should be pursued 

through an integrated approach which encompasses economic, social and 

environmental dimensions, takes into account a gender perspective and consists of 

mutually reinforcing policies and programmes, and which should be balanced, 

targeted, situation-specific and locally owned, include local synergies and initiatives 

and be responsive to the needs of rural populations,  

 Recalling that nearly 80 per cent of the extreme poor live in rural areas and work 

in agriculture, that the extreme poverty rate in rural areas is three times higher than 

in urban areas and that devoting resources to the development of rural areas and 

sustainable agriculture and supporting smallholder farmers, especially women 

farmers, is key to ending poverty in all its forms and dimensions, by, inter alia, 

improving the welfare of farmers,  

 Taking into consideration the increasing number of young people who decide to 

leave rural areas for more urbanized ones and the challenges that this trend poses to 

the livelihood of rural families, 

 Expressing its concern that the extreme poor have limited access to productive 

resources, basic health, education and social protection services, basic infrastructure 

such as roads, water and electricity, and off-farm employment opportunities, and are 

susceptible to the impacts of natural disasters, especially weather-related hazards, 

including the El Niño phenomenon, and the adverse effects of climate change, and 

that rural women and girls fare far worse on most development indicators,  

 Emphasizing the importance of enhancing global support for national work on 

rural development policies and strategies, including on commodity production as well 

as increased public and private investments to upgrade productive capacity, and that 

tackling rural poverty requires integrated, cross-sectoral, multi-stakeholder and 

context-specific interventions, with a strong emphasis on sustainable food and

agricultural systems for food security, nutrition, economic growth, revitalization and 

development in rural areas,  

 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General5 and the recommendations 

contained therein; 

 2. Reaffirms that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, 

including extreme poverty, for all people everywhere, is the greatest global ch allenge 

and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, as well as an 

overarching objective of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 6 of which 

the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing 

for Development7 is an integral part, supporting and complementing it;  

 3. Expresses its deep concern that the progress in reducing poverty remains 

uneven, with 1.3 billion people still living in multidimensional poverty, and that this 

number continues to be significant and unacceptably high, whereas the levels of 

inequality in income, wealth and opportunities remain high or are increasing in a 

number of countries, and the non-income dimensions of poverty and deprivation, such 

as access to quality education or basic health services, and relative poverty remain 

major concerns, and stresses the importance of national and global efforts to create 

conditions for sustainable development, inclusive and sustained economic growth, 

shared prosperity and decent work for all in society, taking into account different 

levels of national development capacities;  

 4. Recognizes the importance of promoting socioeconomic development in 

rural areas as an effective strategy and important means at the global level for the 

eradication of poverty, including extreme poverty, and therefore underlines the 

importance of shaping a rural poverty eradication pattern with the concerted efforts 

of the whole of society to promote socioeconomic development in rural areas;  

 5. Emphasizes that economic growth continues to leave rural dwellers 

behind, that, circa 2018, 80 per cent of the people living in extreme poverty lived in 

rural areas and 40.2 per cent of the population in sub-Saharan Africa lived on less 

than 1.90 dollars per day in 2018, and recommends that countries promote dedicated 

and coordinated social, economic, agricultural and rural development in their national 

policies, including by adopting rural-focused poverty eradication strategies in 

alignment with the 2030 Agenda, social policies aimed at improving human capital in 

rural areas and ensuring access to adequate social protection coverage, agricultural 

policies aimed at boosting agricultural productivity, and rural development policies 

aimed at improving access to rural infrastructure and basic services of high quality 

and at boosting non-farm employment opportunities;  

 6. Recognizes the critical role and contribution of rural women, including 

smallholders and women farmers, and indigenous women and women in local 

communities, and their traditional knowledge in enhancing agricultural and rural 

development, improving food security and eradicating rural poverty;  

 7. Stresses the importance of taking targeted measures to eradicate poverty 

in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, by formulating rural 

development strategies with clear poverty eradication goals, strengthening national 

statistical capacity and monitoring systems and implementing nationally appropriate 

social protection systems and measures for all;  

 8. Encourages all countries and other relevant stakeholders to promote 

inclusive economic transformation in rural areas that increases productivity while

ensuring productive employment and decent work, access to quality public services, 

reliable and appropriate social protection systems, quality and resilient infrastructure, 

roads and telecommunications, as well as preparedness planning for crises and early 

warning, reiterates that the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the important role 

of digital connectivity and access and the potential of e-commerce and e-learning 

solutions for poverty eradication, and thus calls upon all stakeholders to strengthen 

digital, information and communications technology, science, technology and 

innovation cooperation, especially in the area of e-commerce, financial technology 

(fintech), affordable and reliable Internet connectivity and digital infrastructure 

construction to keep food and agriculture supply chains functioning and achieve 

momentum under the 2030 Agenda for an inclusive, sustainable and resilient recovery 

for global development, in particular in rural areas, putting people at the centre of the 

response, protecting our planet and achieving prosperity, with no one left behind, in 

line with the 2030 Agenda; 

 9. Recognizes that eradicating poverty in rural areas cannot be separated from 

the transformation and strengthening of food systems and that ensuring fair markets 

that enable the participation of smallholder and family farmers in food systems, 

particularly in value chains where small-scale producers have a comparative 

advantage, will continue to be important, in this regard takes note with appreciation 

of the Food Systems Summit, held in 2021, which recognized the transformative 

effects of food systems as a driver for the achievement of the Sustainable 

Development Goals by 2030, underscores that promoting a universal, rules-based, 

open, transparent, predictable, inclusive, non-discriminatory and equitable 

multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization is essential for 

building sustainable, inclusive and resilient food systems, and calls upon all count ries 

to promote agricultural and rural development in their national policies, renew their 

efforts to promote the use of innovative approaches towards achieving sustainable 

agriculture and food systems, including sustainable productivity growth, significan tly 

reducing food loss and waste, and strengthen policies that support small -scale 

producers in engaging in agriculture and food system value chains;  

 10. Also recognizes the importance of employment for pro-poor growth in 

rural areas, and encourages the United Nations system and development partners to 

assist countries, upon their request, in mainstreaming employment into investment 

policy and poverty reduction strategies, including those focused on rural area 

development, and fostering rapid agricultural productivity growth, especially in 

developing countries, by increasing investment in agricultural and related rural off -

farm activities;  

 11. Further recognizes the need to design, implement and pursue gender-

responsive economic and social policies aimed at, inter alia, eradicating poverty, 

including in rural areas, and combating the feminization of poverty, ensuring the full 

and equal participation of rural women in the development, implementation and 

follow-up of development policies and programmes and poverty eradication 

strategies, supporting increased rural employment and decent work, and promoting 

the participation of women at all levels and sectors of the rural economy and in 

diverse on-farm and off-farm economic activities, including sustainable agricultural 

and fisheries production;  

 12. Encourages Member States, international organizations, the private sector 

and other partners to develop programmes to foster the creation of decent work in 

rural areas and increase the investment in agricultural and related off-farm activities, 

especially for young people; 

 13. Emphasizes that, globally, 2 billion people, primarily in rural areas in 

developing countries, do not have access to formal financial services, and encourages 



 
A/C.2/76/L.9/Rev.1 

 

7/8 21-16760 

 

further efforts of the international community to offer affordable ways to access 

finance for the financially excluded in rural areas;  

 14. Also emphasizes the need to increase investment, including through 

enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, especially in roads , water, 

sanitation and electricity; 

 15. Expresses its commitment to raising public awareness to promote the 

eradication of poverty and extreme poverty in all countries, to mobilizing the 

enthusiasm and creativity of all stakeholders, especially the rural  residents living in 

extreme poverty, to fight against poverty, to promoting their active participation in 

the design and implementation of programmes and policies that affect them, and to 

providing quality education for the rural poor, with the aim of achieving the 2030 

Agenda; 

 16. Reiterates the need for enhanced and expanded access by developing 

countries to appropriate technologies that are pro-poor and raise productivity, and 

underlines the need for measures to increase investment in agriculture, including 

modern technologies, as well as in natural resources management and capacity -

building of developing countries;  

 17. Stresses that the achievement of sustainable development and the 

eradication of poverty also hinge on the ability and readiness of co untries to 

effectively mobilize domestic resources, attract foreign direct investment, fulfil 

official development assistance commitments and use official development assistance 

effectively, and facilitate the transfer of technology to developing countries , on 

mutually agreed terms, and further stresses that the resolution of unsustainable debt 

situations is critical for heavily indebted poor countries, while remittances have 

become a significant source of income and finance for receiving economies and thei r 

contribution to the achievement of sustainable development;  

 18. Recognizes the importance of addressing the diverse needs of and 

challenges faced by countries in special situations, in particular African countries, the 

least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island 

developing States, as well as the specific challenges facing many middle -income 

countries, and therefore requests the United Nations development system, the 

international financial institutions, regional organizations and other stakeholders to 

ensure that these diverse and specific development needs are appropriately considered 

and addressed, in a tailored fashion, in their relevant strategies and policies, with a 

view to promoting a coherent and comprehensive approach towards individual 

countries;  

 19. Realizes that bridging the digital divide will require strong commitment 

by all relevant stakeholders at the national and international levels, reiterates the 

importance of investing in infrastructure for greater access to affordable technological 

devices and services for rural populations, which includes leveraging technology -

enabled financial services and financial technologies to promote financial inclusion, 

and encourages efforts by all relevant stakeholders, especially United Nations 

agencies, funds and programmes, in the spirit of win-win cooperation, to assist 

developing countries in overcoming the digital divide and promoting the use of 

information and communication technologies to foster economic and social 

development, particularly in rural areas, with the aim of building a shared future for 

humankind; 

 20. Recognizes the devastating impact of diseases on societies, and calls for 

measures by relevant United Nations bodies, in accordance with their respective 

mandates, and other stakeholders to make good use of their experience and 

advantages to further help developing countries with the aim of improving rural

21-16760 8/8 

 

development planning, including poverty eradication and multisectoral development 

activities covering economic and social aspects, including the gender perspective;  

 21. Reiterates the urgent need to accelerate the pace of rural poverty 

eradication, and requests the Secretary-General, in close collaboration with the 

secretariat of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, as well as 

other relevant international organizations, to submit to the General Assembly at its 

seventy-seventh session a report on the status of the implementation of and follow -

up to the present resolution in order to identify the progress achieved, gaps and 

challenges faced in rural poverty eradication, especially in developing countries, as 

well as the means of implementation to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and address 

its impacts, and to list rural poverty eradication as a priority for an annual Sustainable 

Development Goals moment to highlight inspiring action on the Goals, in the context 

of the general debate of the General Assembly;  

 22. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-seventh 

session, under the item entitled “Eradication of poverty and other development 

issues”, the sub-item entitled “Eradicating rural poverty to implement the 2030 

Agenda for Sustainable Development”.
