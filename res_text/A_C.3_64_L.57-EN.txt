 Reaffirming the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United 
Nations concerning the strict observance of the principles of sovereign equality,

peoples, the non-use of force or of the threat of use of force in international 
relations and non-interference in affairs within the domestic jurisdiction of States, 

 Reaffirming also that, by virtue of the principle of self-determination, all 
peoples have the right freely to determine their political status and to pursue their 
economic, social and cultural development, and that every State has the duty to 
respect this right in accordance with the provisions of the Charter, 

 Reaffirming further the Declaration on Principles of International Law

negative effects on the policy and economies of affected countries resulting from

developing countries in various parts of the world, including in areas of armed 
conflict, and the threat they pose to the integrity of and respect for the constitutional 
order of the affected countries, 

 Convinced that, notwithstanding the way in which they are used or the form

operations by third Powers, inter alia, encourage the demand for mercenaries on the 
global market; 

 4. Urges once again all States to take the necessary steps and to exercise 
the utmost vigilance against the menace posed by the activities of mercenaries and 
to take legislative measures to ensure that their territories and other territories under 
their control, as well as their nationals, are not used for the recruitment, assembly, 
financing, training and transit of mercenaries for the planning of activities designed 
to impede the right of peoples to self-determination, to destabilize or overthrow the

to destabilize constitutional regimes; 

 6. Encourages States that import the military assistance, consultancy and 
security services provided by private companies to establish regulatory national 
mechanisms for the registering and licensing of those companies in order to ensure 
that imported services provided by those private companies neither impede the 
enjoyment of human rights nor violate human rights in the recipient country;

necessary action to accede to or ratify the International Convention against the 
Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries;6

mercenaries;

parts of the world, in particular in areas of conflict, and the threat they pose to the

accordance with domestic law and applicable bilateral or international treaties; 

 11. Condemns any form of impunity granted to perpetrators of mercenary 
activities and to those responsible for the use, recruitment, financing and training of 
mercenaries, and urges all States, in accordance with their obligations under 
international law, to bring them, without distinction, to justice;

 14. Notes with appreciation the work of the Working Group on its 
elaboration of concrete principles on the regulation of private companies offering

activities as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the 
right of peoples to self-determination, in particular regarding the effects of the 
activities of private military and security companies on the enjoyment of human 
rights; 

 17. Requests the Office of the High Commissioner to continue supporting the 
Working Group convening regional governmental consultations on this matter, with 
the remaining two to be held before the end of 2010, bearing in mind that this 
process may lead to the holding of a high-level round table of States, under the 
auspices of the United Nations, to discuss the fundamental question of the role of 
the State as holder of the monopoly of the use of force, with the objective of 
facilitating a critical understanding of the responsibilities of the different actors,

respective obligations for the promotion and protection of human rights and in 
reaching a common understanding as to which additional regulations and controls

mercenary-related activities, in order to meet the demands of its current and future 
activities;
