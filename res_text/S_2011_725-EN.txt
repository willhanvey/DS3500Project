  France, Germany, India, Norway, Russian Federation, United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United States 
of America: draft resolution 
 
 

 The Security Council, 

 Recalling its previous resolutions concerning the situation in Somalia, 
especially resolutions 1814 (2008), 1816 (2008), 1838 (2008), 1844 (2008), 1846 
(2008), 1851 (2008), 1897 (2009), 1918 (2010), 1950 (2010), 1976 (2011), and 2015 
(2011), as well as the Statement of its President (S/PRST/2010/16) of 25 August 
2010, 

 Continuing to be gravely concerned by the ongoing threat that piracy and 
armed robbery at sea against vessels pose to the prompt, safe, and effective delivery 
of humanitarian aid to Somalia and the region, to the safety of seafarers and other 
persons, to international navigation and the safety of commercial maritime routes, 
and to other vulnerable ships, including fishing activities in conformity with 
international law, and also gravely concerned by the extended range of the piracy 
threat into the western Indian Ocean and adjacent sea areas, and the increase in 
pirate capacities, 

 Expressing concern about the reported involvement of children in piracy off 
the coast of Somalia, 

 Recognizing that the ongoing instability in Somalia contributes to the problem 
of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, and stressing the need 
for a comprehensive response by the international community to repress piracy and 
armed robbery at sea and tackle its underlying causes,  

 Recognizing the need to investigate and prosecute not only suspects captured 
at sea, but also anyone who incites or intentionally facilitates piracy operations, 
including key figures of criminal networks involved in piracy who illicitly plan, 
organize, facilitate, or finance and profit from such attacks and reiterating its 
concern over a large number of persons suspected of piracy having to be released 
without facing justice, reaffirming that the failure to prosecute persons responsible 
for acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia undermines 
anti-piracy efforts of the international community and being determined to create 
conditions to ensure that pirates are held accountable, 

 Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political 
independence and unity of Somalia, including Somalia’s rights with respect to 
offshore natural resources, including fisheries, in accordance with international law, 



S/2011/725  
 

11-60432 2 
 

recalling the importance of preventing, in accordance with international law, illegal 
fishing and illegal dumping, including of toxic substances, and stressing the need to 
investigate allegations of such illegal fishing and dumping, and noting with 
appreciation in this respect the report of the Secretary-General on the protection of 
Somali natural resources and water (S/2011/661) prepared pursuant to paragraph 7 
of Security Council Resolution 1976 (2011), 

 Further reaffirming that international law, as reflected in the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (“The Convention”), sets 
out the legal framework applicable to combating piracy and armed robbery at sea, as 
well as other ocean activities, 

 Again taking into account the crisis situation in Somalia, and the limited 
capacity of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) to interdict, or upon 
interdiction to prosecute pirates or to patrol or secure the waters off the coast of 
Somalia, including the international sea lanes and Somalia’s territorial waters, 

 Noting the several requests from the TFG for international assistance to 
counter piracy off its coast, including the letter of 10 November 2011, from the 
Permanent Representative of Somalia to the United Nations expressing the 
appreciation of the TFG to the Security Council for its assistance, expressing the 
TFG’s willingness to consider working with other States and regional organizations 
to combat piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, and requesting 
that the provisions of resolution 1897 (2009) be renewed for an additional twelve 
months, 

 Commending the efforts of the EU operation Atalanta, North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization operations Allied Protector and Ocean Shield, Combined Maritime 
Forces’ Combined Task Force 151, and other States acting in a national capacity in 
cooperation with the TFG and each other, to suppress piracy and to protect 
vulnerable ships transiting through the waters off the coast of Somalia, and 
welcoming the efforts of individual countries, including China, India, Islamic 
Republic of Iran, Japan, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Saudi 
Arabia, and Yemen, which have deployed ships and/or aircraft in the region, as 
stated in the Secretary-General’s report (S/2011/662), 

 Welcoming the capacity-building efforts in the region made by the 
International Maritime Organization (IMO) Djibouti Code of Conduct, the Djibouti 
Code of Conduct Trust Fund, and the Trust Fund Supporting Initiatives of States 
Countering Piracy off the Coast of Somalia, and recognizing the need for all 
engaged international and regional organizations to cooperate fully, 

 Noting with appreciation the efforts made by IMO and the shipping industry to 
develop and update guidance, best management practices, and recommendations to 
assist ships to prevent and suppress piracy attacks off the coast of Somalia, 
including in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean area, and recognizing the work 
of the IMO and the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (“CGPCS”) 
on privately contracted armed security personnel on board ships in high-risk areas. 

 Noting with concern that the continuing limited capacity and domestic 
legislation to facilitate the custody and prosecution of suspected pirates after their 
capture has hindered more robust international action against the pirates off the 
coast of Somalia, and in some cases has led to pirates being released without facing 
justice, regardless of whether there is sufficient evidence to support prosecution, and 



 S/2011/725
 

3 11-60432 
 

reiterating that, consistent with the provisions of the Convention concerning the 
repression of piracy, the 1988 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts 
Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (“SUA Convention”) provides for parties 
to create criminal offences, establish jurisdiction, and accept delivery of persons 
responsible for or suspected of seizing or exercising control over a ship by force or 
threat thereof or any other form of intimidation, 

 Underlining the importance of continuing to enhance the collection, 
preservation and transmission to competent authorities of evidence of acts of piracy 
and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, and welcoming the ongoing work 
of IMO, INTERPOL and industry groups to develop guidance to seafarers on 
preservation of crime scenes following acts of piracy, and noting the importance for 
the successful prosecution of acts of piracy of enabling seafarers to give evidence in 
criminal proceedings,  

 Noting the consensus at the ninth plenary session of the CGPCS on  
14 July 2011 to establish a formal Working Group 5 on “illicit financial flows linked 
to piracy off the coast of Somalia”,  

 Further recognizing that pirates are turning increasingly to kidnapping and 
hostage-taking, and that these activities help generate funding to purchase weapons, 
gain recruits, and continue their operational activities, thereby jeopardizing the 
safety and security of innocent civilians and restricting the flow of free commerce, 

 Reaffirming international condemnation of acts of kidnapping and hostage-
taking, including acts condemned in the International Convention against the Taking 
of Hostages, and strongly condemning the continuing practice of hostage-taking by 
suspected pirates operating off the coast of Somalia, expressing serious concern at 
the inhuman conditions hostages face in captivity, recognizing the adverse impact on 
their families, calling for the immediate release of all hostages, and noting the 
importance of cooperation between Member States on the issue of hostage-taking 
and the need for the prosecution of suspected pirates for taking hostages, 

 Commending the Republic of Kenya and the Republic of Seychelles’ efforts to 
prosecute suspected pirates in their national courts, welcoming the engagement of 
the Republic of Mauritius and the United Republic of Tanzania, and noting with 
appreciation the assistance being provided by the United Nations Office on Drugs 
and Crime (UNODC), the Trust Fund Supporting Initiatives of States Countering 
Piracy off the Coast of Somalia, and other international organizations and donors, in 
coordination with the CGPCS, to support Kenya, Seychelles, Somalia, and other 
States in the region, including Yemen, to take steps to prosecute, or incarcerate in a 
third state after prosecution elsewhere, pirates, including facilitators and financiers 
ashore, consistent with applicable international human rights law, and emphasizing 
the need for States and international organizations to further enhance international 
efforts in this regard, 

 Welcoming the readiness of the national and regional administrations of 
Somalia to cooperate with each other and with States who have prosecuted 
suspected pirates with a view to enabling convicted pirates to be repatriated back to 
Somalia under suitable prisoner transfer arrangements, consistent with applicable 
international law including international human rights law, 



S/2011/725  
 

11-60432 4 
 

 Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General (S/2011/662), as requested by 
resolution 1950 (2010), on the implementation of that resolution and on the situation 
with respect to piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia,  

 Taking note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General on the 
modalities for the establishment of specialized Somali anti-piracy courts 
(S/2011/360) prepared pursuant to paragraph 26 of resolution 1976 (2011), and the 
ongoing efforts within the CGPCS and the United Nations Secretariat to explore 
possible additional mechanisms to effectively prosecute persons suspected of piracy 
and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, including those ashore who incite 
or intentionally facilitate acts of piracy,  

 Stressing the need for States to consider possible methods to assist the 
seafarers who are victims of pirates, and welcoming in this regard the ongoing work 
within the CGPCS and the International Maritime Organization on developing 
guidelines for the care of seafarers and other persons who have been subjected to 
acts of piracy, 

 Further noting with appreciation the ongoing efforts by UNODC and UNDP to 
support efforts to enhance the capacity of the corrections system in Somalia, 
including regional authorities notably with the support of the Trust Fund Supporting 
Initiatives of States Countering Piracy off the Coast of Somalia, to incarcerate 
convicted pirates consistent with applicable international human rights law, 

 Bearing in mind the Djibouti Code of Conduct concerning the Repression of 
Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in the Western Indian Ocean and the Gulf 
of Aden, and recognizing the efforts of signatory States to develop the appropriate 
regulatory and legislative frameworks to combat piracy, enhance their capacity to 
patrol the waters of the region, interdict suspect vessels, and prosecute suspected 
pirates, 

 Emphasizing that peace and stability within Somalia, the strengthening of State 
institutions, economic and social development and respect for human rights and the 
rule of law are necessary to create the conditions for a durable eradication of piracy 
and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, and further emphasizing that 
Somalia’s long-term security rests with the effective development by the TFG of the 
National Security Force, including the Somali Police Force, in the framework of the 
Djibouti Agreement and in line with a national security strategy, 

 Welcoming in this regard that the 6 September 2011 Roadmap to end the 
transition in Somalia calls for the TFG to develop counter-piracy policy and 
legislation in conjunction with regional entities, and the declaration of an Exclusive 
Economic Zone (EEZ), as key tasks of the Transitional Federal Institutions (TFIs), 
and notes that the Security Council has made its future support to the TFIs 
contingent upon the completion of the tasks contained in the Roadmap, 

 Determining that the incidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast 
of Somalia exacerbate the situation in Somalia, which continues to constitute a 
threat to international peace and security in the region, 

 Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 

 1. Reiterates that it condemns and deplores all acts of piracy and armed 
robbery against vessels in the waters off the coast of Somalia; 



 S/2011/725

 3. Stresses the need for a comprehensive response to repress piracy and 
tackle its underlying causes by the international community; 

 4. Recognizes the need to investigate and prosecute not only suspects

 5. Calls upon States to cooperate also, as appropriate, on the issue of 
hostage-taking, and the prosecution of suspected pirates for taking hostages; 

 6. Notes again its concern regarding the findings contained in the  
20 November 2008 report of the Monitoring Group on Somalia (S/2008/769,  
page 55) that escalating ransom payments and the lack of enforcement of the arms 
embargo established by resolution 733 (1992) are fuelling the growth of piracy off 
the coast of Somalia, calls upon all States to cooperate fully with the Somalia and 
Eritrea Monitoring Group including on information sharing regarding possible arms 
embargo violations; 

 7. Renews its call upon States and regional organizations that have the 
capacity to do so, to take part in the fight against piracy and armed robbery at sea 
off the coast of Somalia, in particular, consistent with this resolution and 
international law, by deploying naval vessels, arms and military aircraft and through 
seizures and disposition of boats, vessels, arms and other related equipment used in 
the commission of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, or for 
which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting such use; 

 8. Commends the work of the CGPCS to facilitate coordination in order to

1897 (2009), and paragraph 7 of resolution 1950 (2010), granted to States and 
regional organizations cooperating with the TFG in the fight against piracy and 
armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, for which advance notification has 
been provided by the TFG to the Secretary-General; 

 10. Affirms that the authorizations renewed in this resolution apply only with 
respect to the situation in Somalia and shall not affect the rights or obligations or 
responsibilities of Member States under international law, including any rights or 
obligations, under the Convention, with respect to any other situation, and 
underscores in particular that this resolution shall not be considered as establishing 
customary international law; and affirms further that such authorizations have been

exempted from those measures in accordance with the procedure set out in 
paragraphs 11 (b) and 12 of resolution 1772 (2007); 

 12. Requests that cooperating States take appropriate steps to ensure that the 
activities they undertake pursuant to the authorizations in paragraph 9 do not have 
the practical effect of denying or impairing the right of innocent passage to the ships 
of any third State; 

 13. Calls on Member States to assist Somalia, at the request of the TFG and 
with notification to the Secretary-General, to strengthen capacity in Somalia, 
including regional authorities, to bring to justice those who are using Somali 
territory to plan, facilitate, or undertake criminal acts of piracy and armed robbery at 
sea, and stresses that any measures undertaken pursuant to this paragraph shall be 
consistent with applicable international human rights law; 

 14. Calls upon all States, and in particular flag, port, and coastal States, 
States of the nationality of victims, and perpetrators of piracy and armed robbery, 
and other States with relevant jurisdiction under international law and national 
legislation, to cooperate in determining jurisdiction, and in the investigation and 
prosecution of all persons responsible for acts of piracy and armed robbery off the 
coast of Somalia, including anyone who incites or facilitates an act of piracy, 
consistent with applicable international law including international human rights

urgency, of the establishment of specialized anti-piracy courts in Somalia and other 
States in the region with substantial international participation and/or support, as set 
forth in resolution 2015 (2011), and the importance of such courts having 
jurisdiction over not only suspects captured at sea, but also anyone who incites or 
intentionally facilitates piracy operations, including key figures of criminal 
networks involved in piracy who illicitly plan, organize, facilitate, or finance and 
profit from such attacks, and emphasizes the need for strengthened cooperation of 
States, regional, and international organizations in holding such individuals 
accountable, and encourages the CGPCS to continue its discussions in this regard; 



 S/2011/725
 

7 11-60432
