  Preventing and combating illicit brokering activities  
 

 

 The General Assembly,  

 Noting the threat to international peace and security posed by illicit bro kering 

activities circumventing the international arms control and non-proliferation 

framework, 

 Concerned that, if proper measures are not taken, the illicit brokering of arms 

in all its aspects will adversely affect the maintenance of international peace  and 

security, and prolong conflicts, and could be an obstacle to sustainable economic 

and social development and result in illicit transfers of conventional arms and the 

acquisition of weapons of mass destruction by non-State actors, 

 Recognizing the need for Member States to prevent and combat illicit 

brokering activities, which covers not only conventional arms but also materials, 

equipment and technology that could contribute to the proliferation of weapons of 

mass destruction and their means of delivery,  

 Reaffirming that efforts to prevent and combat illicit brokering activities 

should not hamper the legitimate arms trade and international cooperation with 

respect to materials, equipment and technology for peaceful purposes,  

 Recalling Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) of 28 April 2004, in 

particular paragraph 3, which determined that all States shall develop and maintain 

appropriate effective border controls and law enforcement efforts to detect, deter, 

prevent and combat, including through international cooperation when necessary, 



A/C.1/69/L.48 
 

 

14-62925 2/3 

 

illicit trafficking and brokering of materials related to nuclear, chemical or 

biological weapons and their means of delivery, in accordance with their national 

legal authorities and legislation and consistent with international law,  

 Recalling also General Assembly resolution 67/43 of 3 December 2012,  

 Taking note of international efforts to prevent and combat illicit arms 

brokering, in particular in small arms and light weapons, as demonstrated by the 

adoption in 2001 of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the 

Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects,1 and the entry into 

force in 2005 of the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in 

Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition, supplementing the United 

Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,2 

 Recognizing the importance of States parties to the Arms Trade Treaty taking 

measures, pursuant to their national laws, to regulate brokering taking place under 

their jurisdiction, in accordance with article 10 of the Treaty, which will enter into 

force on 24 December 2014,  

 Noting the adoption on 26 September 2013 of Security Council resolution 

2117 (2013) on small arms and light weapons, in which the Council encourages 

cooperation and information-sharing on suspect brokering activities to address the 

illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light 

weapons, 

 Noting also the report of the Group of Governmental Experts established 

pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/81 of 8 December 2005 to consider 

further steps to enhance international cooperation in preventing, combating and 

eradicating illicit brokering in small arms and light weapons3 as an international 

initiative within the framework of the United Nations,  

 Welcoming efforts to implement the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat 

and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, 

and welcoming also in this regard the outcome document of the Second United 

Nations Conference to Review Progress Made in the Implementation of the 

Programme of Action, held in New York from 27 August to 7 September 2012, 4 

including as it relates to illicit brokering of small arms and light weapons, 

 Underlining the inherent right of Member States to determine the specific 

scope and content of domestic regulations in accordance with their legislative 

frameworks and export control systems, consistent with international law,  

 Welcoming the efforts made by Member States to implement laws and/or 

administrative measures to regulate arms brokering within their legal systems,  

 Encouraging cooperation among Member States to prevent and combat illicit 

trafficking in nuclear materials, and recognizing in this regard existing efforts at all 

levels, consistent with international law,
