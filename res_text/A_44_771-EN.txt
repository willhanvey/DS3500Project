Additional Protocol I of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in
Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelo lco) ,  2/

into account that within the zone of application of that Treaty,
to which twenty-three sovereign States are already parties, there are some
territories  which,  in  spite  of  not  being sovereign pol i t ical  entit ies ,  are
nevertheless in a position to receive the benefits deriving from the Treaty
through its Additional Frotocol  I, to which the four States that de or
de facto are internationally responsible for  those territories may become
part ies ,

.m that it is not fair  that the peoples of some of those
territorjes  are deprived of such benefits without beiag  given the opportunity
to express their opinion in this connection,
