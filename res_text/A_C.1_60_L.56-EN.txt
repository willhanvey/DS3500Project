emplacement,

Believing it necessary to do the utmost to contribute in an efficient and
coordinated manner to facing the challenge of removing anti-personnel mines placed
throughout the world and to assure their destruction,

Wishing to do the utmost in ensuring assistance for the care and rehabilitation,
including the social and economic reintegration, of mine victims,

Welcoming the entry into force, on 1 March 1999, of the Convention on the
Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel
Mines and on Their Destruction,1 and noting with satisfaction the work undertaken
to implement the Convention and the substantial progress made towards addressing
the global landmine problem,

Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of
Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction,7 held in Nairobi from 29 November
to 3 December 2004, at which time the international community renewed its
unwavering commitment to achieving the goal of a world free of anti-personnel
mines and witnessed the adoption by the States parties to the Convention of the
Nairobi Action Plan 2005-20098 to achieve major progress towards ending, for all
people and for all time, the suffering caused by anti-personnel mines,

Convention, bringing the total number of States that have formally accepted the
obligations of the Convention to one hundred and forty-seven,

Emphasizing the desirability of attracting the adherence of all States to the
Convention, and determined to work strenuously towards the promotion of its
universalization,

Noting with regret that anti-personnel mines continue to be used in conflicts
around the world, causing human suffering and impeding post-conflict development,
