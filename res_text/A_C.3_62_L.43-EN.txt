 The General Assembly, 

 Guided by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights,1 the International Covenants on Human Rights2 and other 
international human rights instruments, 

 Mindful that the Islamic Republic of Iran is a party to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,2 the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights,2 the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination3 and the Convention on the Rights of the Child,4 

 Recalling its previous resolutions on the situation of human rights in the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, the most recent of which is resolution 61/176 of 
19 December 2006, 

 Regretting that no special procedure has been permitted to visit the Islamic 
Republic of Iran since July 2005, despite the standing invitation extended by the 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to all human rights thematic monitoring 
mechanisms in April 2002,

 1. Expresses its deep concern at the ongoing systematic violations of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of the Islamic Republic of Iran, as 
described in the above-referenced resolutions, and at the failure of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran to implement the steps called for in these resolutions;  

 2. Expresses its very serious concern that, since the adoption of resolution 
61/176, there have been, inter alia, confirmed instances of: 

 (a) Torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
including flogging and amputations; 

 (b) Public executions, including multiple public executions, and of other 
executions carried out in the absence of respect for internationally recognized 
safeguards; 

 (c) Stoning as a method of execution, and the continued issuing of sentences 
of stoning; 

 (d) Execution of persons who were under the age of 18 at the time their 
offence was committed, contrary to the obligations of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
under article 37 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child4 and article 6 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;2 

 (e) Arrests, violent repression, and sentencing of women exercising their 
right to peaceful assembly, a campaign of intimidation against women’s human 
rights defenders, and continuing discrimination against women and girls in law and 
in practice; 

 (f) Increasing discrimination and other human rights violations against 
persons belonging to religious, ethnic, linguistic or other minorities, recognized or 
otherwise, including, inter alia, Arabs, Azeris, Baluchis, Kurds, Christians, Jews, 
Sufis and Sunni Muslims and their defenders, and, in particular, attacks on Baha’is 
and their faith in State-sponsored media, increasing evidence of efforts by the State 
to identify and monitor Baha’is and prevention of the Baha’i faith from attending 
university and from sustaining themselves economically; an increase in cases of 
arbitrary arrest and detention; 

 (g) Ongoing, systemic and serious restrictions of freedom of peaceful 
assembly and association, and freedom of opinion and expression, including those 
imposed on the media and trade unions, and increasing harassment, intimidation and 
persecution of political opponents and human rights defenders, from all sectors of 
Iranian society, including arrests and violent repression of labour leaders, labour 
members peacefully assembling and students; 

 (h) Persistent failure to uphold due process of law rights, and violation of the 
rights of detainees, including the systematic and arbitrary use of prolonged solitary 
confinement; 

 3. Calls upon the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to respect 
fully its human rights obligations and, in this regard, to implement fully the above-
mentioned resolutions, and in particular: 

 (a) To eliminate, in law and in practice, amputations and flogging and other 
forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; 



 A/C.3/62/L.43
 

3 07-57956 
 

 (b) To abolish, in law and in practice, public executions and other executions 
carried out in the absence of respect for internationally recognized safeguards; 

 (c) To abolish, in law and in practice, the use of stoning as a method of 
execution; 

 (d) To abolish, as called for by the Committee on the Rights of the Child in 
its report of January 2005,5 executions of persons who at the time of their offence 
were under the age of 18; 

 (e) To eliminate, in law and in practice, all forms of discrimination and 
violence against women and girls; 

 (f) To eliminate, in law and in practice, all forms of discrimination and other 
human rights violations against persons belonging to religious, ethnic, linguistic or 
other minorities, recognized or otherwise, to refrain from monitoring individuals on 
the basis of their religious beliefs, and to ensure that access of minorities to 
education and employment is on par with that of all Iranians; 

 (g) To implement, inter alia, the 1996 report of the Special Rapporteur on 
religious intolerance,6 which recommended ways in which the Islamic Republic of 
Iran could emancipate the Baha’i community; 

 (h) To end the harassment, intimidation and persecution of political 
opponents and human rights defenders, including by releasing persons imprisoned 
arbitrarily or on the basis of their political views; 

 (i) To uphold due process of law rights, and to end impunity for human 
rights violations; 

 4. Encourages the thematic procedures of the Human Rights Council to 
visit the Islamic Republic of Iran and otherwise continue their work to improve the 
situation of human rights in the country, and urges the Government of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran to live up to the commitment it made when it issued a standing 
invitation to special procedures by cooperating with them, and to illustrate how their 
subsequent recommendations are being addressed;  

 5. Decides to continue its examination of the situation of human rights in 
the Islamic Republic of Iran at its sixty-third session under the item entitled 
“Promotion and protection of human rights”, and, to this end, requests the 
Secretary-General to submit to it at that session a comprehensive report on the 
situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
