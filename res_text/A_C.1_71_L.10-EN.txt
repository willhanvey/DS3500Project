Review and implementation of the Concluding Document  

of the Twelfth Special Session of the General Assembly: 

Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons

  Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons 
 

 

 The General Assembly, 

 Convinced that the use of nuclear weapons poses the most serious threat to the 

survival of mankind, 

 Bearing in mind the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 

8 July 1996 on the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons,
1
 

 Convinced that a multilateral, universal and binding agreement prohibiting the 

use or threat of use of nuclear weapons would contribute to the elimination of the 

nuclear threat and to the climate for negotiations leading to the ultimate elimination 

of nuclear weapons, thereby strengthening international peace and security,  

 Conscious that some steps taken by the Russian Federation and the United 

States of America towards a reduction of their nuclear weapons and the 

improvement in the international climate can contribute towards the goal of the 

complete elimination of nuclear weapons,  

 Recalling that in paragraph 58 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special 

Session of the General Assembly
2
 it is stated that all States should actively 

participate in efforts to bring about conditions in international relations among 

States in which a code of peaceful conduct of nations in international affairs could

be agreed upon and which would preclude the use or threat of use of nuclear 

weapons, 

 Reaffirming that any use of nuclear weapons would be a violation of the 

Charter of the United Nations and a crime against humanity, as declared in its 

resolutions 1653 (XVI) of 24 November 1961, 33/71 B of 14 December 1978, 

34/83 G of 11 December 1979, 35/152 D of 12 December 1980 and 36/92 I of 

9 December 1981, 

 Determined to achieve an international convention prohibiting the 

development, production, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons, leading to their 

ultimate destruction, 

 Stressing that an international convention on the prohibition of the use of 

nuclear weapons would be an important step in a phased programme towards the 

complete elimination of nuclear weapons, with a specified framework of time,  

 Noting with regret that the Conference on Disarmament, during its 2016 

session, was unable to undertake negotiations on this subject as called for in 

General Assembly resolution 70/62 of 7 December 2015, 

 1. Reiterates its request to the Conference on Disarmament to commence 

negotiations in order to reach agreement on an international convention prohibiting 

the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances;  

 2. Requests the Conference on Disarmament to report to the General 

Assembly on the results of those negotiations.
