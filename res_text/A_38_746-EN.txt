Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund, 11 and the related report of the Advisory 
Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, ~ 

Welcoming the improvement in the actuarial situation of the Fund as a result 
of the economy measures applied with effect from 1 January 1983, 

Concerned at the continuing actuarial imbalance of the Fund and the mounting 
cost of the pension system, 

Desirous to bring about a further improvement in the actuarial situation of 
the Fund, 

Concerned at the different evolution over the years of the levels of 
pensionable remuneration for staff in the Professional and higher categories and 
those of the comparator civil service, 

Recalling its resolutions 3526 (XXX) of 16 December 1975, 31/196 of 
22 December 1976, 33/120 of 19 December 1978, 34/221 of 20 December 1979, 35/215 of 
17 December 1980, 36/118 of 10 December 1981 and 37/131 of 17 December 1982, 

Conscious of earlier General Assembly resolutions which stated, inter alia, 
that changes in the pension adjustment system should not lead to increases in the 
liabilities of Member States, 

Conscious also that a number of factors have combined to make necessary the 
consideration and adoption of significant remedial actions on the problem of the 
actuarial imbalance, including the raising of the rate of contributions 
hereinafter referred to, 

Mindful of the social aspects of the pension system, 

Aware that a co-operative effort by member organizations, participants and 
beneficiaries is required if the actuarial imbalance is to be reduced or 
eliminated, thereby securing an adequate level of benefits under the Fund, 

I 

Amendment of the Regulations of the United Nations 
Joint Staff Pension Fund 

1. Decides that, with effect from 1 January 1984, the rate of contributions

7.25 per centJ
