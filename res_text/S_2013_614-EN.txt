mutually reinforcing manner, of resolutions 1325 (2000), 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009), 
1889 (2009), 1960 (2010) and 2106 (2013) and all relevant statements of its

 Bearing in mind the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United

the maintenance of international peace and security, and noting the focus of this 
resolution is, in this regard, the implementation of the women, peace and security

 Reaffirming that women’s and girls’ empowerment and gender equality are 
critical to efforts to maintain international peace and security, and emphasizing that 
persisting barriers to full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) will only be 
dismantled through dedicated commitment to women’s empowerment, participation, 
and human rights, and through concerted leadership, consistent information and 
action, and support, to build women’s engagement in all levels of decision-making,  

 Taking note with appreciation the report of the Secretary-General of

violence against women in armed conflict and post-conflict situations, but 
remaining deeply concerned about persistent implementation deficits in the women, 
peace and security agenda, including in: protection from human rights abuses and 
violations; opportunities for women to exercise leadership; resources provided to 
address their needs and which will help them exercise their rights; and the capacities 
and commitment of all actors involved in the implementation of resolution 1325 
(2000) and subsequent resolutions to advance women’s participation and protection,  

 Expressing concern at women’s exacerbated vulnerability in armed conflict 
and post-conflict situations particularly in relation to forced displacement, as a result 
of unequal citizenship rights, gender-biased application of asylum laws, and obstacles 
to registering and accessing identity documents which occur in many situations,  

 Expressing deep concern at the full range of threats and human rights 
violations and abuses experienced by women in armed conflict and post-conflict 
situations, recognizing that those women and girls who are particularly vulnerable 
or disadvantaged may be specifically targeted or at increased risk of violence, and 
recognizing in this regard that more must be done to ensure that transitional justice 
measures address the full range of violations and abuses of women’s human rights, 
and the differentiated impacts on women and girls of these violations and abuses as 
well as forced displacement, enforced disappearances, and destruction of civilian 
infrastructure,  

 Recognizing the importance of Member States and United Nations entities 
seeking to ensure humanitarian aid and funding includes provision for the full range 
of medical, legal, psychosocial and livelihood services to women affected by armed 
conflict and post-conflict situations, and noting the need for access to the full range 
of sexual and reproductive health services, including regarding pregnancies 
resulting from rape, without discrimination,  

 Reiterating its strong condemnation of all violations of international law 
committed against and/or directly affecting civilians, including women and girls in 
armed conflict and post-conflict situations, including those involving rape and other 
forms of sexual and gender-based violence, killing and maiming, obstructions to 
humanitarian aid, and mass forced displacement,  

 Recognizing that States bear the primary responsibility to respect and ensure 
the human rights of all persons within their territory and subject to their jurisdiction 
as provided for by international law, and reaffirming that parties to armed conflict 
bear the primary responsibility to ensure the protection of civilians,  

 Reaffirming that sustainable peace requires an integrated approach based on 
coherence between political, security, development, human rights, including gender 
equality, and rule of law and justice activities, and in this regard emphasizing the 
importance of the rule of law as one of the key elements of conflict prevention, 
peacekeeping, conflict resolution and peacebuilding,  

 Recognizing the need for more systematic attention to the implementation of 
women, peace and security commitments in its own work, particularly to ensure the 
enhancement of women’s engagement in conflict prevention, resolution and 
peacebuilding, and noting in this regard the need for timely and systematic reporting 
on women, peace and security,

United Nations peace and security in the field, human rights and development work 
as a means to address root causes of armed conflict and threats to the security of
