 The Security Council, 

 Recalling all its previous resolutions, statements of its President and press 

statements on the situation in Mali,  

 Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, unity and territorial 

integrity of Mali, emphasizing that the Malian authorities have primary responsibility 

for the provision of stability, security and protection of civilians throughout the 

territory of Mali, urging the Malian authorities to uphold their efforts to meet their 

obligations in that regard, and expressing great concern at the violent and unilateral 

actions taken by non-State actors hampering the return of State authority and basic 

social services,  

 Reaffirming the basic principles of peacekeeping, including consent of the 

parties, impartiality and non-use of force, except in self-defence and defence of the 

mandate, recognizing that the mandate of each peacekeeping mission is specific to 

the need and situation of the country concerned, and recalling its Presidential 

Statement of 14 May 2018 (S/PRST/2018/10), 

 Expressing grave concern about the continued deterioration of the security and 

humanitarian situation in Mali, including through the persistence of a high level of 

attacks by terrorist groups in the North and in the Centre, and the continuation of 

intercommunal violence in the Centre, which led to human rights violations and 

abuses and have caused the loss of numerous innocent lives as well as numerous 

internally displaced persons and refugees in neighbouring countries, people in  critical 

need of assistance and children without access to education due to school closures, 

and have hindered humanitarian access, expressing concern over the impact of the 

COVID-19 pandemic and the significant ongoing food crisis in Mali, and further 

expressing deep concern that the situation in Mali negatively impacts that of 

neighbouring countries and of the Sahel region,  

 Emphasizing that security and stability in Mali are inextricably linked to that of 

the Sahel and West Africa, as well as to that of Libya and North Africa, 

 Strongly condemning the continued attacks against civilians, representatives 

from local, regional and State institutions, as well as national, international and UN 

security forces, including the Malian Defence and Security Forces (MDSF), the G5 

Sahel joint force (FC-G5S), the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated 

Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), the French forces and the European 

Union Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali), paying tribute to the bravery and 

sacrifices made by the soldiers engaged in Mali and the Sahel, especially to those who 

lost their lives, and calling for continuing support to the MDSF in their fight against 

terrorism,

 Underlining that lasting peace and security in the Sahel region will not be 

achieved without a combination of political, security and development efforts 

benefitting all regions of Mali, as well as the full, effective and inclusive 

implementation of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali ( “the 

Agreement”), which involves all Malian actors supportive of the peace process and 

ensures full, effective and meaningful participation of women and youth,  

 Recognizing that an integrated and coherent approach among relevant political, 

security and developmental actors, within and outside of the United Nations system, 

consistent with their respective mandates, is critical to building and sustaining peace 

in Mali and the Sahel, and recalling the objectives of the United Nations Integrated 

Strategy for the Sahel, 

 Welcoming the Pau Summit of 13 January 2020 and the creation of a “Coalition 

for the Sahel”, aimed at fighting against terrorism, strengthening the Sahelian States ’ 

military capabilities, supporting the restoration of State authority throughout the 

territory, and bolstering development assistance, further welcoming the set-up of the 

Takuba Task Force, and of the Partnership for Security and Stability in the Sahel, as 

well as increased engagement from the African Union and the Economic Community 

of West African States, and welcoming, in this regard, the initiative to deploy an 

African Union-led force in the Sahel, 

 Recognizing that some progress was made during the past six months in the 

implementation of the Agreement, and that a combination of some level of political 

will and international pressure, including through the prospect of sanctions, 

constituted important factors in securing this progress and underlining that 

MINUSMA, along with the other security presences mentioned in resolution 2480 

(2019), significantly contributes to the implementation of the Agreement and t o the 

stabilization of Mali, 

 Expressing a significant sense of impatience with parties over the persistent 

delays in the full implementation of key provisions of the Agreement, noting that 

protracted delays in implementation contribute to a political and security vacuum 

jeopardizing the stability and development of Mali as well as the viability of the 

Agreement, and stressing the need for increased ownership and prioritization in the 

implementation of the Agreement,  

 Underlining that engaging in hostilities in violation of the Agreement as well as 

actions taken that obstruct, or that obstruct by prolonged delay, or that threat en the 

implementation of the Agreement constitute a basis for sanctions designations 

pursuant to resolution 2374 (2017), among other designation criteria,  

 Noting the Stratégie de stabilisation du centre du Mali by the Malian authorities 

as well as other initiatives aimed at addressing the situation in Central Mali, and 

stressing that stabilization of the situation there requires the Malian authorities and 

relevant stakeholders to implement this strategy by pursuing simultaneous progress 

on security, governance, development, reconciliation, accountability, as well as 

protection and promotion of human rights,  

 Welcoming the holding of the national inclusive dialogue which was a 

significant step in building consensus on key political and institutional reforms, and 

further welcoming the increased representation of women in the National Assembly,  

 Strongly condemning all violations and abuses of international human rights law 

and violations of international humanitarian law, including those involving 

extrajudicial and summary executions, arbitrary arrests and detentions and ill -

treatment of prisoners, sexual and gender-based violence, and trafficking in persons, 

as well as killing, maiming, recruitment and use of children, attacks against schools, 

humanitarian actors and services, and medical personnel and infrastructure identified

as such, and calling upon all parties to bring an end to such violations and abuses and 

to comply with their obligations under applicable international law, 

 Reiterating, in this regard, the importance of holding accountable all those 

responsible for such acts and that some of such acts referred to in the paragraph above 

may amount to crimes under the Rome Statute, taking note that, acting upon the 

referral of the transitional authorities of Mali dated 13 July 2012, the Prosecutor of 

the International Criminal Court (ICC) opened on 16 January 2013 an investigation 

into alleged crimes committed on the territory of Mali since January 2012, and further 

taking note of the finalization of the work of the International Commission of Inquiry 

established in accordance with the Agreement and as requested by resolution 2364 

(2017), 

 Emphasizing the need for adequate risk assessment and risk management 

strategies, by the Government of Mali and the United Nations, of ecological changes, 

natural disasters, drought, desertification, land degradation, food insecurity, energy 

access, climate change, among other factors, on the security and stability of Mali,  

 Commending troop- and police-contributing countries of MINUSMA for their 

contribution, paying tribute to the peacekeepers who risk, as well as lost, their lives 

in this respect, 

 Welcoming MINUSMA’s efforts to implement its adaptation plan, with a view 

to integrating all mission components and increasing its protected mobility, agility 

and flexibility, and therefore improving its support to the implementation of the 

Agreement, to the stabilization and restoration of State authority in the Centre and 

enhancing protection of civilians, notably by setting-up a Mobile Task Force, 

 Expressing concern over reports of some training and capabilities shortfalls of 

MINUSMA units, undeclared caveats, non-compliance with orders, and emphasizing 

the importance of transparency and accountability of the mission’s performance, 

 Recognizing that, in light of the specific and challenging environment in which 

it is deployed, MINUSMA interacts with other security presences which have the 

potential to be mutually beneficial instruments to restore peace and stability in Mali 

and the Sahel region,  

 Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General (S/2020/476) and the letter 

of the Secretary-General (S/2020/481), 

 Determining that the situation in Mali continues to constitute a threat to 

international peace and security,

 2. Welcomes the important steps taken in the fulfilment of some of the 

priority measures of the Agreement referenced in paragraph 4 of resolution 2480 

(2019) but regrets that several of them have not been fully implemented, and recalls 

its readiness to respond with measures pursuant to resolution 2374 (2017) should the 

parties engage in hostilities in violation of the Agreement, take actions that obstruct, 

or that obstruct by prolonged delay, or that threaten the implementation of the 

Agreement;
